Building Livestream Privacy Product,"Hey everyone,  
I’ve been working on a little side project and wanted to share it to get some thoughts from people who stream more than I do.

I kept having moments where I’d worry about showing something by accident while livestreaming — like someone walking behind me, my email inbox popping up, or saying something personal without thinking. So I tried building a tool that automatically hides that stuff in real time.

Right now it only does face blurring (works locally through OBS), but I’m experimenting with adding text detection, object masking for IDs/documents, and maybe some basic audio filtering. It’s not monetized or anything; I’m mainly exploring whether something like this is actually useful or if I’m overthinking the whole problem.

I put up a small demo version on a website just so I could test it across different devices. I’ll drop the link in the comments instead of here since Reddit tends to filter posts with links.

If anyone here has thoughts—whether it’s “this is helpful,” “this is pointless,” or “here’s what would actually matter to me”—I’d appreciate it. Even if the idea is bad, I’d rather know early.

Thanks for reading.",Dismal-Platypus-6647,1pczlrb,SideProject,03-12-2025,09:18:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pczlrb/building_livestream_privacy_product/
built an app in under 24 hours for the anything hackathon,"i made a calisthenics tracker called gravity because every fitness app i tried was either too bloated or couldn't handle what i actually needed: mixing reps, static holds, and emom timers in one routine.

built it for the anything hackathon. didn't write a single line of code manually.

my process was basically prompt-chaining through different ai tools:

* started with gemini to get my messy ideas into actual requirements
* asked it to generate a detailed prompt for a design tool (wanted that swiss minimalist look)
* used sleek design to iterate on the ui until it felt right
* exported that into anything to generate the react native code

the wild part was using the app at the gym the next morning.

found a bug in the timer mid-set, fixed it with a prompt on my phone, and it was working before my next set.

the code is probably not perfect, but honestly, who cares? going from idea to real app in a day feels so magical.

"Can we please talk about banning the constant ""What are you building today"" posts?","I love this sub and the community we have here, but I need to address something that's been bothering me more and more.

We're getting flooded with ""What are you building today"" posts multiple times a day. I'm talking 10 plus posts of the exact same format every single day. And here's the problem: all the genuinely cool and interesting side projects that people worked hard on are getting completely buried.

Someone shares an innovative tool they spent months developing? It gets lost in the noise within hours. A creative solution to a real problem? Drowned out by repetitive daily threads.

I genuinely believe we need to have a conversation about whether these types of posts should be automatically removed by AutoMod. Many other successful subs have implemented similar rules to prevent repetitive content and it has massively improved the overall quality.

This community has so much potential to be a place where we discover amazing projects and get genuinely inspired. But right now the signal to noise ratio is way off.

I want to know what you all think. Should we implement a rule to ban or restrict these repetitive ""What are you building"" posts? Do you feel the same way about the current state of the sub? Or am I overreacting here?

I Built this Tool to Stop My ADHD Brain From Derailing Every Project,"I love the speed of vibe-coding in Cursor and Claude Code. But I kept hitting the same wall.

I’d get a burst of excitement, jump straight into building, and *think* I knew what I wanted. Then halfway through, I’d realize I wasn’t clear, the AI wasn’t aligned, and I was buried in troubleshooting hell.

Because of my ADHD, the excitement of the idea always outran the clarity of the plan. I was starting before I was thinking—and it was nuking my side projects.

So I built **Esono** — a workspace that helps you figure out what you actually mean *before* you prompt the AI.

**Quick example:** I dropped in four articles about Suno and asked Esono to map the technical architecture. It read the URLs, understood the system, generated a diagram in real time, and let me refine it through chat.

**The real value:** You can think spatially—map ideas, surface assumptions, and spot gaps before you start building. By the time you open Cursor, you're not guessing anymore. Your prompts hit on the first try.

It’s for anyone who thinks visually, moves fast, and is tired of the prompt → troubleshoot → reprompt loop.

"Shipped an MVP, got 322 users in 3 weeks. Now learning the uncomfortable part.","I finally shipped a small MVP three weeks ago. It’s a recall-focused study tool meant for exam learners who forget most of what they study after a week.

I expected crickets. Instead I got:

* 322 active users
* 3700+ in-product actions
* 11 percent returning users
* Users from 16 countries
* Mostly mobile usage even though I built desktop-first
* Feedback forms full of brutally honest comments, not compliments

The funny part is, the thing I thought would make people leave wasn’t the UI, lack of polish, or missing features.

The drop-off happens **after the very first generated result**.

People try it once, evaluate it silently, then either bounce or come back multiple times in a day. No middle ground.

This is the part I’m sitting with now, because it’s not a technical problem, it’s a product psychology problem.

Some questions I’m trying to answer:

1. Is the first result not strong enough to create an “oh wow” moment?
2. Do users need onboarding that *frames the output* instead of letting them judge blindly?
3. Should I focus on retention before trying to grow more users?
4. When is the right moment to test pricing instead of just gathering usage?

I added a few new features this week based on feedback:  
login, capsule history, sharing, downloads, and a small Pro toggle.

Now I’m resisting the urge to keep building without understanding the **first 60 seconds** of the user journey better.

If you’ve reached the messy middle where an MVP starts meeting real behavior instead of assumptions, how did you decide what to optimize first?

Happy to hear lessons, scars, or frameworks.

I built a baby monitor app with offline mode + “loud noises only” alerts — would love feedback!,"Hey everyone! 👋

I’m a solo developer and recently became a parent, and like many parents I ran into the usual baby monitor problems — random disconnects, too many false alerts, and apps that rely too heavily on cloud accounts or WiFi.

So I built a simple alternative as a side project: **NannyCam**, a baby monitor app that works between any two phones.

A few things I wanted to try that I couldn’t find elsewhere:

• Works online or completely offline

When WiFi is unstable or not available, the devices connect directly (no cloud, no accounts).

• “Loud noises only” mode

Fans, white noise, and tiny rustles were constantly waking me up, so I added a mode that only alerts when the volume crosses a meaningful threshold (like crying or fussing).

• Fast setup

Open app → scan QR → monitoring. No sign-up, nothing stored anywhere.

• Built in Flutter

So it’s mostly cross-platform — working on the iOS version now after some platform-specific adjustments.



I just launched the Android version and would love feedback from fellow makers:

* Does the idea make sense?
* Anything unclear in the onboarding?
* Missing features you’d expect?
* Any UX improvements you’d suggest?

"I'm building an ""Intent-Based"" option strategist. Thoughts?","Hey guys,

Quick intro about why I am doing this:

I do stock option trading a lot. I often use tools like OptionStrat or basic P&L calculators for data. Then use AI for the following math and option choosing process.

I often have a thesis like: *""I think POET has 5X potential if it gets a huge process on its development, but I have a small account, and I don't want to bet too much on it.""*

After going through all the IV check, price check, and strategy analysis, I found Leap Call may be the best choice.

**So, I wonder why I can't automate the whole process? Using all the option data and option strategies.**

I call it **OptionStrat AI** (name WIP). The concept is simple:

1. You type your intent in plain English (e.g., ""Bullish on NVDA but worried about IV crush"").
2. The AI generates the mathematically optimal structure (Spreads, Calendars, etc.).
3. It shows a **Scenario Matrix** comparing how the trade performs when you are right vs. when you are wrong.

I'm just an indie dev/trader building this on weekends. I haven't launched the full app yet, but I put up the core concept and a waitlist. 

  
I know basically it's an AI wrap, but it may give an easy solution for option traders.

**I'd love to know if this is something you'd actually use, or if I should stick to Excel.**

"[TESTERS WANTED] I built Clipwize, a native macOS app that uses AI to organize your messy Kindle highlights (TestFlight Link Inside!)","Hey Redditors 👋

If you're like me, your **Kindle** highlights are a treasure trove of forgotten knowledge, but they're an absolute mess-jumbled titles, missing authors, and impossible to search through. The raw files are useless!

I decided to stop complaining and built **Clipwize**, a native **macOS 26+** app to fix this once and for all.

# 🌟 What Clipwize Does:

* **AI Cleanup:** Automatically fixes broken book titles and author names.
* **Auto-Tagging:** Uses AI to suggest relevant tags for better organization.
* **Powerful Global Search:** Search instantly across your entire library, with the search term highlighted right in the quote preview.
* **Local Data:** Everything is stored securely on your local database.
* **Easy Import:** Automatically detects when your Kindle is plugged in!

# 🧪 Call for Testers:

The first **TestFlight** build is officially ready! I'm looking for **macOS 26+** users who read on **Kindle** to jump in, kick the tires, and help me squash bugs and shape the final features (like that brainstorming feature!).

If you're frustrated with your current highlight workflow, I'd love your honest feedback.

I finally built my first micro-SaaS: an AI-powered “One-Click Content Repurposer”,"I’ve been obsessed with the idea of taking one piece of content and converting it into *everything text-based* — tweets, LinkedIn posts, shorts scripts, captions, Reddit posts, email drafts, etc.

So I built a small tool that does exactly that.

It takes any blog post, article, notes, or transcript and instantly turns it into platform-ready **text content**. The goal is simple:  
No more staring at a blank screen. No more rewriting the same idea 5 times. Just one click → multiple formats.

I’m building this as a tiny micro-SaaS and releasing the first version today. Still very early, still rough in places, but functional enough to ship.

Because Stripe doesn’t support Indian entities for SaaS billing, I’ve temporarily paused paid/pro registration — but the free version is fully live and open to try.

I made a Markdown visualizer for mobile that actually handles code blocks and tables correctly. Supports HTML preview & Watermarks.,"**The Problem:**
Sharing or saving those long, complex AI responses on mobile is a pain. Screenshots are messy and fragmented. Copying text to Notes often breaks the formatting, especially with **code blocks** and **tables**.

**The Solution:**
I built **MarkViz**. It’s a tool specifically designed to render and export Markdown/HTML content on iOS.

**What makes it different?**
* **Perfect Rendering:** I spent a lot of time tweaking the engine to ensure code syntax highlighting and tables look ""publication-ready"" on mobile screens.
* **HTML & Markdown Preview:** WYSIWYG. What you see is what you get.
* **Visual Exports:**
    * **Long Image:** Stitches everything into one high-res image.
    * **PDF:** Standard document format for archiving.
    * **Mind Maps:** Instantly converts text structure into a visual mind map (great for studying).
* **Privacy First:** Everything is processed locally on your device.
* **Watermarks:** Recently added custom watermark support based on user requests.

"Again, again and again","I’m 20 years old. Born in Serbia, lived my whole life in Italy, and now based in Berlin.

My first startup was called Hiwork, a marketplace connecting workers (bartenders, waiters, etc.) with companies (hotels, restaurants). I launched it with the owner of three hotels, who had the idea and put in the first €3k, plus two technical guys writing the code. I was doing basically everything else: sales, marketing, content, finding mentors, networking, designing the whole product and its features.

We went live in July. We got two press articles, two TV interviews, 500 users in the first week, 900 the second, and around 80 companies on the platform. The first interviews between workers and businesses were happening. Two VCs offered us €500k in total, and we had an angel ready to put in €50k.

But the team wasn’t aligned. The tech guys weren’t interested in building a business; they just wanted to write code and finish university. The hotel owner had his own job and three hotels to run. I was the only one showing up at the office every day, alone, and eventually the motivation disappeared. So I left.

After that, I launched another startup with an Italian guy living in London who works at Deliveroo. It was called Puasee, a productivity tool that lets you lock apps on your phone using a physical card. We built the e-commerce, the mobile app, and the physical product in 45 days. We launched, sold 10 cards, and then decided to pivot to B2B for no-phone clubs, schools, and concerts. But Deliveroo got acquired, he became extremely busy, I had just moved to Berlin, my life was chaotic, and my job suddenly became 11 hours a day. It was the wrong timing for both of us.

Now I’m an EIR in a fast-growing scaleup in the food-delivery space. I’m responsible for launching a new business unit (catering), which hit €40k in its first two months with zero resources. I also manage our biggest clients, acquire new ones, do sales, and help the founders prepare our next funding round, since we’re raising €4M.

But honestly, I’m starting to feel the itch to build something again. Something disruptive, something intense, something fun.

I’ll be in San Francisco at Christmas to catch the vibe, and I think I might move there next year.

"Side project - An anonymous writing project: printed letters, poems & quiet companionship.","Hi All,

Over the past year, I realised something quietly heartbreaking:  
In this fast pace world, we have stopped appreciating small things like kindness and small acts for another. Most of us have never received a real letter.  
Not one written slowly, with care.  
Not one meant to sit with us on difficult days.  
Not one that feels like a hand on the shoulder.

So I started a small, anonymous project called **Gumnam Khat**.

Every month, I write and print a letter and a poem  
crafted around themes like healing, loneliness, softness, grief, rediscovery, purpose, and the things we learn too late.

There is no face behind the project.  
Just a voice, a feeling, a presence.

If you’re going through something,  
if you feel disconnected,  
if you like reflective writing,  
or if you just want a small moment each month that feels like someone truly sees you…

I’d be honoured to send you one of my letters.

You can DM me if you want to subscribe or are interested in getting one.   
And any suggestions on sub-reddits where i can post these.  
  
Thanks in advance for reading!

Uninstalr 3.0 Release Candidate,"You can download Uninstalr 3.0 second public Release Candidate from this link: [https://uninstalr.com/private/Uninstalr\_Portable\_v3\_RC2b.exe](https://uninstalr.com/private/Uninstalr_Portable_v3_RC2b.exe)

Uninstalr is an advanced software uninstaller that can automate the uninstallation of almost all software and also uses its own custom uninstallation engine to remove any leftovers. It also supports detecting leftovers from previously uninstalled software, and a lot of other powerful features. The full list of features is available at [https://uninstalr.com/](https://uninstalr.com/)

Here are some key improvements compared to the current official version (Uninstalr 2.8):

* The installed apps list now shows the country of origin for all known installed apps.
* The listing of paths before uninstallation starts now displays checkboxes, allowing users to uncheck any paths the user doesn’t want to be removed.
* The program now uses less RAM and performs the scan for installed software on average 40% faster.
* The main window bar now includes Settings and About buttons.

Please note that this is *not the final version*. It may still contain bugs, so testing it on a virtual machine is recommended. Also, please don’t share this build publicly or upload it to download sites.

If you find any issues, please let me know so I can fix them before the official release. If you are reporting any issues relating to uninstalling any specific software, please tell me which software you were trying to uninstall when the issue occurred so I can try to reproduce the issue and fix it.

I'm the developer of Uninstalr, so you can send any feedback here as a comment or directly to me via a private message.

I built an app that serves entirely as my personalized news assistant.,"Hi Side Projectors,

Since learning about information feeds, I've been developing a tool called Youfeed, a personalized information tracking assistant.

I love AI, technology, movies, and reading. I have a very high demand for information, but the update speed is so fast that I often can't keep up with the latest news or distinguish between fact and fiction. This makes me anxious; I feel overwhelmed by information!

My friends and I have all used this app, and many more have used it for a while and think it's a great tool, which gives me a lot of confidence.

I believe it's worthwhile to do this in this information-saturated age!

Currently, Youfeed can:

* Track any topic you care about - technology, markets, science, global events, niche interests
* Filter low-quality noise, keeping only reliable sources
* Generate concise summaries with AI, allowing you to immediately grasp the key points
* Get real-time alerts when important events are updated
* Show the development of events using a timeline
* And there are no ads, no endless information feeds, and no information anxiety.

I want to hear everyone's honest feedback on how it works, whether it's truly convenient for you, and I think I can improve it!

Thank you for reading. If you're interested in Youfeed, feel free to give it a try!

I save a lot of images - screenshots of articles, design inspiration, memes, project references. But weeks later, I have no idea what half of them are about.

**Solution:** Gallero - a gallery app that lets you add notes and tags to images, with search that actually helps you find stuff.

**Tech Stack:**

* Kotlin + Jetpack Compose
* Room Database for local storage
* Modern Material Design UI
* Full media management (photos, videos, screenshots)

**Key Features:**

* 📝 Add notes to any image
* 🏷️ Custom tagging system
* 🔍 Search notes and tags
* 🎨 Clean, modern UI
* 📱 Works with all your media

**What I learned:**

* Sometimes the best projects solve your own problems
* Simple features done well > complex features done poorly
* Modern UX matters even for ""utility"" apps

**Challenges:**

* Android media permissions are a pain
* Optimizing database queries for large galleries
* Making search fast and relevant

It's live on the Play Store now. Built this primarily for myself, but figured others might have the same problem.

"Freelancers who hate juggling 5 tools – can I steal 2 minutes of your brain?

If this is a dumb idea or already solved, please tell me so I don’t waste months building it 🙏","Hey, freelancing people 👋

I’m a solo dev and I’m considering building a **super simple CRM just for freelancers** – not agencies, not enterprises, just 1‑person businesses.

The problem I keep hearing:

* Client info is scattered across email, WhatsApp, Notion, spreadsheets.
* Deals / leads get lost because there’s no simple pipeline.
* Invoices live in a separate tool, and it’s hard to see “who owes me what this month”.​

My idea is a **single web app** that does only this:

* **Clients:** one place with contact info + notes + history.
* **Deals:** a tiny Kanban board (New → Contacted → Proposal → Won/Lost) so you don’t forget to follow up.
* **Projects & tasks:** simple list of projects and to‑dos per client.
* **Invoices:** create/send basic invoices and mark them as Sent / Paid / Overdue.
* **Dashboard:** “expected this month”, “outstanding invoices”, “active clients” – no crazy charts.​

No AI, no marketing automation, no 50 tabs. Just a clean, boring, reliable tool for solo freelancers.  
Pricing idea: something like **$12–$15/month** once it’s useful.

**I’m not trying to sell you anything right now. I just want truth:**

1. Does this actually solve a real headache for you, or nah?
2. What are you using today (Notion, Excel, Wave, Dubsado, etc.), and what annoys you most about it?​
3. If this existed and was dead simple, what’s the **one feature** it would absolutely need for you to even try it?
4. At what price would this be a total “no‑brainer” vs “lol no thanks”?

If you’re willing to be a beta tester later, I can DM you when I have a rough version up (no spam, just “it’s live, want to try it?”).

This is the v1.0 release simple, practical, Excel-based and I’d really appreciate any feedback from people who have worked with AI systems, audits, or governance challenges.

# What’s inside:

* **Automated Risk Register** Likelihood × Impact × Detectability scoring, heatmap, dropdown categories, color-coded prioritization
* **Governance Guide (PDF)** Roles, workflows, examples, ready-to-use checklists
* **Helper Sheet** Full logic layer + formula references for people who want to customize it
* **Screenshots + Demo** (Added visual previews so you can see the structure quickly)

# Why I built this:

A lot of small teams *want* to use AI responsibly but don’t know where to start.  
This toolkit is meant to be a simple starting point for mapping risks and building governance habits.

# What I’d love feedback on:

* Are the scoring categories intuitive?
* Is the heatmap helpful or too simple?
* Any risks/controls I should add for v1.1?
* Any pain points you’ve seen in AI risk work?

I built a tool that audits any GitHub repo using AI — need honest feedback (would you pay for this?),"Hey everyone,
I’ve been building a small dev tool over the past week and would love some brutally honest feedback from the community.

I made a simple platform where you just paste a GitHub repo link → click “Scan” → and it generates a full AI-powered audit of the project.

No login, no setup, no installing anything.

Right now the audit includes things like:

code quality review

potential bugs

best-practice violations

file-level analysis

suggestions for improvement

architecture hints

readability recommendations


Basically my goal is to help developers get a quick “second pair of eyes” on their code without paying for expensive enterprise tools.

👉 Here’s the live demo: [Try my app](https://codegalaxy-iota.vercel.app/)

I have a few questions for anyone who tries it:

1. Is this actually useful?


2. What is missing from the audit?


3. Would you ever pay for a deeper scan (security checks, architecture review, refactor suggestions, etc.)?


4. What would make this tool feel “worth it”?

Right now it’s just an MVP — no signup, no payment system, no tracking. I just want to understand if this solves a real problem for anyone other than me.

"I just got my first freelance project… and I’m already overwhelmed. How do you all manage clients, tasks, files, payments, EVERYTHING?","Hey everyone,  
I just landed my **first proper freelance project**, and I expected to feel happy… but honestly? I’m mostly anxious right now.

A close friend of mine (who freelances full-time) told me about all the chaos he deals with daily:

* clients constantly asking “any update?”
* important messages lost in WhatsApp
* tasks scattered across Notion/Trello
* feedback buried in long chats
* milestone confusion
* files everywhere in Google Drive
* payment screenshots & reminders
* no proper place to track what’s done vs pending

And now that I finally have my first project, all of this is stuck in my head.

I’m scared I’ll mess something up.  
Not with the work itself…  
but with the **management** around it.

Because right now, I don’t even know what the “right setup” looks like.

Like:

* Do you track tasks on Notion?
* Or use Trello?
* Or just stick to WhatsApp?
* Where do you store files so nothing gets lost?
* How do you handle feedback & approvals?
* Do you share status with clients on call/text or through some proper system?
* How do you manage payment milestones without awkward conversations?

It feels like freelancing requires 5–7 tools just to stay sane, and that’s making me more nervous than the actual work.

So I really want to learn from people who’ve been doing this longer:

# 1. How do YOU manage the entire workflow?

(Clients → tasks → deadlines → files → approvals → payments)

# 2. What parts get messiest for you?

For my friend it’s tracking feedback + payments.

# 3. Do you keep everything in one place or spread across many apps?

# 4. What was the hardest thing for you when you first started freelancing?

# 5. is there ONE place where clients could see progress, tasks, files, approvals, and payment milestones — that would actually help, or  is that unnecessary? and I'm Overthinking? I'm genuinely curious. there actually would it be too much?

I really want to get this right and not drown in chaos on my very first project.  
Any advice, systems, mistakes-to-avoid, or your own setups would help me a LOT.

I am building a super-simple invoicing tool for freelancers — would love feedback (waitlist now live),"Hey everyone,
I’m a solo developer and recently started working on a tool because I was frustrated with how heavy and bloated most invoicing platforms feel.

So I’m building Easy-Invoice.co — a minimal, fast way for freelancers and creators to generate clean, professional invoices in seconds.

It’s not live yet — I’m opening a waitlist for early testers, and I’d genuinely love feedback from this community before I ship the full version.

What it will do:

⚡ Create invoices in under 60 seconds

📄 Clean & professional templates

💸 Payment-ready links

Built a Shopify app that catches shipping delays before customers complain - need feedback from real store owners,"Hey everyone,

I've spent the last few months building a tool for Shopify stores after hearing the same frustration over and over: store owners find out about shipping delays AFTER their customers are already pissed off.

**What it does:**

* Monitors carrier tracking APIs in real-time
* Predicts delays before they happen
* Automatically prioritizes your VIP customers (high LTV buyers get notified first)
* Triggers smart compensation based on customer value and issue severity
* Converts negative experiences into 5-star reviews

there is a rough demo link down below

**Where I'm at:** I have a working prototype, but I'm at the validation stage. I need to know if this actually solves a real problem or if I'm overthinking something store owners handle fine already.

**what i need from the community**

* Would you actually integrate this into your store?
* What's the deal-breaker feature I'm missing?
* What would you pay for something like this (if anything)?

Not looking for compliments - I need brutal honesty from people who actually run ecommerce businesses.

I've been consistently trying my hand at app development since last year, but I kept running into obstacles. I'd usually get caught up in adding too many features, which led to burnout, or I'd get stuck in the App Store review process.

I’m absolutely stunned and incredibly happy to share that it climbed to **#1 in the Food & Drink category** and **#25 overall among all paid apps** in the Korean market! It’s an unbelievable feeling.

"turned my PhD on procrastination into a side project… and it just hit 3,000 downloads!!","Hi everyone,

I’m a psych PhD student researching procrastination because I struggled with it massively myself (research is me-search after all). But I didn’t want my experiments to sit in journals where no one outside academia would ever see them.

So on the side, I started building **dawdle** \- an anti-procrastination app based on my experiments, my publications, and 100+ other studies. It’s basically my research brain in app form.

**The catch:** I had zero coding background.  
I learned SwiftUI from Apple’s tutorials (pre-AI, pre-vibe-coding lol), fought my way through so many weird errors, and kept going. I’ve been working on it for 1 year and 2 months now. Launched it on the App Store on September 18th… and then held my breath.

Somehow, we hit **3,000 downloads**.  
I don’t even know that many people in real life.

But honestly, the best part has been the messages: “this helped me get momentum today.”, “addressing the emotions behind it actually works.” (Also: many bug reports. I’m fixing those too - solo founder life.)

It still feels surreal that this all started because four years ago, procrastination nearly made me quit my PhD. Turning that pain point into something that helps other people feels… really full-circle.

I’m a professional distance runner and solo dev, and I’ve just soft-launched an iOS app that gives you an **AI running coach + running buddy**: training plans, adjustments, and daily check-ins, all via chat.

I’m using December as a **soft launch** to learn, then planning a more “New Year, new running habit” push in January once the paid tier is ready.

**What the app does right now (v1)**

* Choose your coach’s personality
* Text-based chat with your AI running coach (can change your training, give you advice, adjust days, etc.)
* Onboarding to learn about your running history + goals
* Weekly training plan updates based on your progress
* AI-guided runs to keep you motivated on the day

**Intentionally limited:**

* Daily coach chats (to keep costs under control)
* AI-guided runs per week

It’s **100% free**, no credit card, no paid tier enabled yet. Planned for the first paid tier (probably Jan launch):

* Daily voice check-ins with your coach
* Unlimited messages
* Unlimited guided AI runs

**Who this is best for**

* People who want to go beyond a generic “cookie cutter” training plan
* Comfortable with an **early** product – rough edges expected
* iOS + English only for now

"You Build Features, We Build the Foundation (Seeking Market Validation)","My business partner and I are exploring the idea of building a service aimed at radically accelerating product launch by eliminating the architecture and boilerplate phase.

We have created tools (not AI) to create a stack-agnostic codebase in seconds based on high-quality code written by us (real developers).

You could select from a wide range of tech:

* **Frontend:** Flutter AND / OR Next.js/React
* **Backend:** Deno/Hono OR Node/Express OR Lambda
* **Database:** RDS or Dynamo
* **Infrastructure:** Full Terraform / GitHub Actions CI/CD setup, deployed directly into your AWS account.

The delivered IP would include E2E testing, state management, basic CRUD APIs, and professional component libraries.

My questions:

1. **Model Validation:** Our model requires a One-Time Licensing Fee for the perpetual IP, followed by a mandatory retainer for dedicated engineering hours (feature implementation, customization, bug fixes). Does this retainer requirement feel like a guarantee of quality or a barrier to entry?
2. **The Price Barrier:** What is the absolute maximum you would pay for this solution, knowing it saves you months of a senior architect's salary and is immediately production-ready? (Our current thought is a one-time fee in the $10K–$25K range, plus a retainer starting at $1,500/month).
3. **The Core Question:** At what point does buying a pre-architected solution make more sense than spending 6 months hiring and waiting for in-house developers to build the same base?

My SCRI Demo Extension - Making SCRI interactions visual and easy,"Hey r/sideproject! 👋

Wanted to share my latest project: the **SCRI Demo Extension**.

If you've ever dealt with SCRI (or similar complex APIs/interfaces), you know how it can be a pain to quickly test different functionalities or demo specific use cases without writing a ton of boilerplate code or setting up elaborate environments.

That's the problem this extension aims to solve! It's a browser extension that provides a visual interface to interact with SCRI directly from your browser. You can trigger calls, see real-time responses, and play around with various parameters on the fly.

For me, it's been a game-changer for speeding up development and making internal demos much smoother. It turns what could be a deep dive into docs or code into a quick, interactive experience.

I'm really excited about its potential!

I turned my job-hunting nightmare into a side project,"A couple months ago when the federal agencies started mass layoffs, I panicked. As a fed employee, watching people with 10–20 years in government get blindsided shook me. I started job hunting… and immediately hit the same wall everyone complains about: ghost jobs, repost loops, missing salary info, and hours wasted comparing my resume to each posting.



Since I’m a data scientist and love automating everything, I decided to treat this entire nightmare as a side project. Instead of letting AI work against me, I built tools to make AI work *for* me. What started as a script to detect fake/ghost jobs turned into a full chain of tools:



* A script that compares my resume to each job description using an AI agent
* A Chrome side-panel extension that runs directly on Indeed/LinkedIn/Glassdoor/ZipRecruiter and tells me if a job posting looks legit
* Job summaries auto-generated every time I click a posting
* Resume match scoring and interview prep
* And eventually… a full web platform that pulls jobs directly from major job hosts so I can search everything in one place



That little side project became [Joblic](http://www.joblic.com) — something I originally built just to save my own sanity.



I’m still developing it (including mobile apps and more AI tools), so I’m giving every new user $5 in free credits for 30 days. Not as a marketing trick — but because real user feedback is more value than anything I can test on my own. If you try it and tell me what’s confusing, broken, or helpful, you’re directly helping me shape the next version.



If you’re job hunting or just curious how an AI-powered job-search tool works, give it a spin. I’d genuinely love feedback from fellow builders, and anyone grinding a side hustle like this.",GaoCanJump,1pct901,SideProject,03-12-2025,03:18:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pct901/i_turned_my_jobhunting_nightmare_into_a_side/
I built web apps to make clinical work less painful - hoping for feedback!,"Hi r/SideProject,

I work in medicine, and a while ago I started re-learning code to build tools that make my workflow more efficient. Over time I’ve created several small web apps that help with things like simplifying complex calculations, organizing clinical reasoning, and speeding up the review of long documents. Each [tool](http://notomed.dev/tools) focuses on reducing the repetitive tasks and reducing cognitive load. 

All of these tools began as little helpers for myself, but they eventually turned into a connected set of apps that live on one site. Each one tries to take something complicated or time-consuming in my day and make it clearer, more organized, or faster to work through. I like building tools that feel simple and approachable even for people outside medicine, so I spend a lot of time thinking about the interface and the workflow.

For anyone familiar with clinical work, some of the production-ready tools include a:  
  
1) [hyponatremia calculator](https://www.notomed.dev/tools/hypona-calc) that helps determine the cause of low sodium  
  
 2) an [opioid regimen builder ](https://www.notomed.dev/tools/opioid-calc)and [taper](https://www.notomed.dev/tools/opioid-ramp-taper) tool for chronic pain management - and   
  
2) a [note summarizer ](https://www.notomed.dev/tools/note-summarizer)that allows clinicians to quickly and safely query de-identified EMR notes.

I would really appreciate feedback from people who enjoy building things or thinking about design. I’m also open to thoughts on layout, visual style, features that seem missing, or anything that stands out while exploring the tools.

Would you (a young professional) with NO NETWORK use something like this?,"Quick reality check:

* Cold-emailing typically get only \~1–5% response rate (i.e. most outreach goes unanswered).
* Some “warm outreach”, i.e. contacting people you have at least some kind of connection with (shared background, interests, mutual network), reportedly gets response rates around upwards to 34%.

As a recent grad I’ve been on both sides, applying for jobs, trying to reach out on LinkedIn, cold-messaging people whose names I saw once, and it often feels like you’re shouting into an abyss. I’ll send 20–30 messages to people in my field, get maybe 0–1 reply, and spend hours tweaking my message only to get silence. Even when I try to personalize a message, there’s zero context: no shared school, no mutual friend, no common interest. So the outreach feels random, awkward, and too often ends in nothing.

Here’s what I’m thinking:

What if there was a tool that helps you automatically discover and contact people who share real common ground with you, like same university, same major or industry interest, similar background, same nationality or something. And then you get their work/personal email.

So that when you reach out, it isn’t “cold.” You’re not a random stranger. You already share something. I know LinkedIn kinda does this but its still hours of manual work and people are more likely to answer emails than LinkedIn messages

That way, instead of sending 100 cold messages to random people and hoping for 2–5 replies, you’d send a handful of “warm-ish” outreach messages to people more likely to respond, thanks to shared context.

Agentic AI in Legacy Code Modernization,"Hello everyone! I'd love to share our open-source research project, [ATLAS](https://www.github.com/astrio-ai/atlas): **A**utonomous **T**ranspilation for **L**egacy **A**pplication **S**ystems.

We've been working on an open-source AI coding agent designed to modernize legacy codebases (such as COBOL, Fortran, Pascal, etc.) into modern programming languages (such as Python, Java, C++, etc.) directly from your terminal. Imagine something like Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex, but for legacy systems.

**What Our Project Does**

Here are the main features of Atlas:

* **Modern TUI**: Clean terminal interface with brand-colored UI elements
* **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Gemini, and 100+ other LLM providers via LiteLLM
* **Interactive Chat**: Natural conversation with your codebase - ask questions, request changes, and get AI assistance
* **File Management**: Add files to context, drop them when done, view what's in your chat session
* **Git Integration**: Automatic commits, undo support, and repository-aware context
* **Streaming Responses**: Real-time AI responses with markdown rendering
* **Session History**: Persistent conversation history across sessions

You can easily install it by running `pip install astrio-atlas`. Go to the project repository directory where you want to work and start the CLI by running `atlas`.

Here are some example commands:

* `/add` \- add files to the chat
* `/drop` \- remove files from the chat
* `/ls` \- view chat context
* `/clear` \- clear chat history
* `/undo` \- undo last changes
* `/help` \- view available commands

We have plenty of good first issues and we welcome contributions at any level. If you're looking for a meaningful and technically exciting project to work on, Atlas is definitely a good project. Feel free to reach out with any questions. If you’d like to support the project, please consider starring our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/astrio-ai/atlas)! 🌟",nolanolson,1pct1go,SideProject,03-12-2025,03:08:57,https://i.redd.it/zt0yy419ow4g1.png
"Remember Uninvited, Deja Vu & Shadowgate? Yeah I made a game like that lol","If you grew up squinting at CRTs and worshipping box art, you know the era: **Amiga / early DOS**—when games like **Uninvited, Shadowgate, Deja Vu** (and cousins like **Willy Beamish, Police Quest, Ultima VII**) convinced us that pixels could hold secrets, jokes, and doom in equal measure.

**Cease To Breathe** is my love letter to that era: a **compact, non-linear** adventure set in a **demonic nowhere-house** that absolutely does not meet building codes. It’s hand-drawn pixel art, dry humor, and puzzles that respect your brain more than your patience. Try a thing. Try a different thing. Then try the clearly ridiculous thing—because it *might* work.

This isn’t a 40-hour epic. It’s a **tight evening-length adventure** you can finish, then **replay for different endings** and “I wonder if…” experiments.

A salary alone will never build wealth.,"A job is meant to keep you afloat, not take you places. It gives comfort, not control. Stability, not scale.

Money grows differently when you own something. A tiny product. A helpful service. A digital asset. A brand people trust. That’s where income stops being tied to hours.

Most people don’t fail because they won’t try. They fail because they don’t know what to try.

Everyone wants to start something. Very few know where to begin. So they wait. Over-plan. Collect screenshots. Then postpone again.

I was stuck there too. Instead of guessing ideas, I started collecting real problems and pain points  people were complaining about online, across forums, communities, and reviews. Patterns appeared. Repeated frustrations. Clear gaps.

That’s what turned into a massive database of 12,000+ problem-backed startup ideas pulled from actual user pain points, not imagination.

If you’re curious, just search startupideasdb . com on Google.

And here’s the truth nobody says out loud:

You will never feel ready. The idea will never feel perfect. And the timing will never be ideal.

Start before you're confident. Start while it’s messy. Start while you’re unsure.

Because clarity doesn’t come before action. It comes from it.",EllaMusk101,1pcss05,SideProject,03-12-2025,02:56:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pcss05/a_salary_alone_will_never_build_wealth/
"I built a tool to beat the 500-day US Visa wait times in Canada. 50 days in, 0 AWS bill, and some users have already found slots!","Disclaimer: First 2 users are my test ones

I got sick of the 500+ day wait for a US visa appointment here in Canada. 

So I did a side project for me but then opened to the public after success.

The first version was running locally on my mac - it was working but I had to keep my mac plugged in at all times so I hosted it on AWS using Lambda and SES with the initial free tier. 

I threw up a simple frontend 50 days ago just to see if anyone else had the same pain. Just hit 8 paying customers last night.

It’s not retirement money, but validating a side project with $0 overhead (for now) feels pretty good.

Built a tool that generates custom music and auto fits it to your video,"I’ve been making short videos for a while and always struggled with finding background music that was copyright-safe, fit the length of the clip, and didn’t require audio editing. Most of the time I ended up trimming random tracks, adjusting levels by hand, and still worrying about Content ID.

So I built a small tool to fix that for myself.

You upload an MP4, choose a music style, and it generates a custom copyright-cleared and royalty-free track that automatically fits your video. You can preview it, tweak volume or fades, and export when it looks good.

I figured other creators might find it useful too, so here it is if you want to try it and give feedback:

Validating an idea: 5-min anxiety relief tool,"Hey everyone, I've struggled with work anxiety for years. Apps like Calm and Headspace never worked for me because: - When I'm having a panic attack, I can't focus on ""observing my breath"" - 10-minute sessions are too long when I need help RIGHT NOW - The abstract guidance just makes me more anxious 

So I'm exploring a different approach: **\*\*a 5-minute ""emotional first aid"" tool\*\*** that: 1. Starts playing IMMEDIATELY when you open it (no choosing scenarios) 2. Uses concrete, body-based instructions (""squeeze your fists for 5 seconds"") 3. Checks in after 30 seconds: ""Feeling better? Or need another 5 minutes?"" Before I build this, I need your honest input: - Would you actually USE something like this? When? - What would make you choose this over Headspace/Rootd/etc? 

Not trying to sell anything—genuinely want to understand if this solves a real problem or if I'm missing something.

I built a watermark tool to stop Temu/AliExpress/Amazon etc. from stealing designs - launch special pricing,"Hey everyone,

I have a small Etsy shop (stickers/ POD) and while it hasn't happened to me, I know designs getting stolen is a huge problem. I created an app for myself that adds watermarks simply to save time, and I figured it could help others from seeing their designs show up on Amazon, Temu, AliExpress, and the like.

\*\*What it does:\*\*  
\- Scatters text across the ENTIRE image (can't crop out)  
\- Semi-transparent (doesn't ruin photos - 20% opacity default)  
\- Batch processes unlimited images in seconds  
\- Optional logo in corner  
\- Option to embed copyright data in image file (invisible to us, difficult for computer to remove)  
\- 100% offline (your images never leave your computer)

\*\*What it looks like:\*\*  
See images above - before/after comparison with the default settings for text and logo, and the interface.

\*\*The catch:\*\*  
This is v1.0 - very basic, and its WINDOWS ONLY (for now). It runs in a Terminal window (black screen with text). You type answers to simple questions and it processes your images. No fancy GUI yet or Mac version yet; I'm hoping to get the Mac version done in the next few weeks. Macs are finicky.

\*\*Hard Truth:\*\* If you're scared of Terminal/command prompts, this might not be for you YET. If you can handle typing ""white"" or ""black"" and following simple prompts, it works great.

\*\*What you get:\*\*  
\- Windows desktop app (.exe file)  
\- Unlimited watermarking  
\- One-time payment (no subscription)  
\- Updates are free for existing customers.  
\- Full user guide with screenshots and FAQ document  
\- Email support

\*\*Launch pricing:\*\*  
\- \*\*20 USD\*\* for first group of customers  
\- Price goes up to 27 USD after launch period.

I built this for POD sellers. This tool is for you to be able to protect your work. If it sucks, tell me and I'll fix it. If it works, great! You've protected your designs and will be able to protect as many as you want going forward.

\*\*Link in comments\*\*

\*\*Questions?\*\* DM me or ask in comments.  
\*\*Disclaimer:\*\*  
\- Yes, I'm selling this  
\- Yes, I built it myself  
\- Yes, it's basic (Terminal interface)  
\- No, it won't stop 100% of thieves  
\- But it's better than nothing :)

If this violates sub rules, mods please remove and let me know. Just trying to help fellow sellers.

	•	Picked up Terraform — all my infra is now IaC.
	•	Went deep on AI coding agents — experimented to my heart’s content.
	•	Built a complete solo dev skillset — can ship anything end-to-end now.
	•	Decent pay, clear boundaries — just do the work, go home.
	•	Familiar territory — C language, HFT environment.
	•	Hungrier than ever — focus on nights and weekends is sharper now.

Launched my spam detection SaaS on Product Hunt today - here's what I learned building it solo,"Hey everyone!



Just launched SpamScore on Product Hunt this morning and wanted to share my journey with this community.



\*\*The Problem:\*\*

My mom almost fell for a phishing scam that would've cost her $5,000. She forwarded me the email asking ""is this real?"" - made me realize how many people face this daily.



\*\*The Solution:\*\*

Built the simplest spam detector possible:

→ Forward suspicious email to [scan@getspamscore.com](mailto:scan@getspamscore.com)

→ Get instant AI-powered analysis in 60 seconds

→ No apps, extensions, or setup needed



\*\*The Tech Stack:\*\*

\- Backend: Python/FastAPI (serverless on Vercel)

\- Email Processing: Mailgun

\- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

\- Caching/Sessions: Redis (heavily used for user management)

\- Payments: Stripe

\- Frontend: Next.js with Tailwind CSS

\- Spam Detection: Multiple reputation databases (Spamhaus, SURBL, URLhaus) + AI analysis



\*\*Launch Stats (so far):\*\*

\- Built in: \~3 months (solo)

\- Architecture: Serverless for scale, Redis for speed



\*\*What I Learned:\*\*

1. Redis caching is essential - cut response times from 5s to <1s

2. Mailgun's webhook system is tricky but powerful once you get it

3. Handling forwarded emails is harder than it looks (preserving headers, dealing with mobile clients)

4. FastAPI + Vercel serverless = surprisingly good combo

5. Pricing is scary but just pick something and test



\*\*The Numbers:\*\*

\- Free tier: 100 scans/month

\- Paid: $9/mo (300 scans), $29/mo (3K scans), $79/mo (15K scans)

\- Currently in beta with live payments

\- Average scan time: <60 seconds



\*\*Technical Challenges Solved:\*\*

\- False positive detection (legit emails marked as spam)

\- Mobile email forwarding (different headers than desktop)

\- Real-time analysis of 50+ spam indicators

\- Scalable architecture that doesn't break the bank



\*\*Product Hunt Special:\*\*

First 100 users get 50 bonus scans + referral bonuses

Code: PRODUCTHUNT for 20% off

PH: [https://www.producthunt.com/posts/spamscore-llc](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/spamscore-llc)



Happy to answer any questions about spam detection, building with FastAPI, Redis optimization, or launching solo!



For the developers: The Redis caching strategy alone is worth discussing - happy to dive deep on that.

Validating an idea: Domain search history & tracking tool,"I'm in the validation phase of a side project and would love honest feedback from fellow builders.

**The idea:** A tool that automatically saves every domain you search, organizes them, and alerts you when domains become available.

**Why I'm questioning it:** I've hit that moment where I'm asking: ""Is this a real problem or am I just building something I think is cool?""

**What I've found so far:**

* Read 50+ Reddit/Twitter threads where people mentioned losing track of domain ideas
* Most registrars don't save search history
* People seem to use spreadsheets or notes as workarounds

**But I need to validate:**

1. Have you ever lost track of a good domain idea? How often?
2. Is this a ""need to have"" or ""nice to have"" for you?
3. How do you currently track domain searches?
4. Would you actually use a tool like this, or is it one of those ""sounds good but I'd never actually use it"" ideas?

**What I'm NOT doing:**

* Not promoting anything (still in validation)
* Not trying to sell you anything
* Just genuinely trying to understand if this is worth building

Would especially love to hear from:

* Solo founders who've gone through the naming process
* Anyone who researches domains regularly

"I built a Golang scraper to feed my local LLMs, and it accidentally turned into a podcast","Hey everyone,

When models like Llama 3.2, GPT-OSS, and Gemma started becoming efficient enough to run on laptops, I wanted a way to force myself to keep up with the ecosystem.

I built [**Merge Conflict Digest**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mergeconflictdigest.com%2F) as a forcing function to learn.

**The Original Stack (Text Only):**

* **Backend:** Golang. Includes a public HTTP server, a private one for Admin management, and the email publisher.
* **Frontend:** A React app for managing articles that will go in the newsletters, and Nextjs for the user-facing website.
* **Input:** Scrapes 50+ sources daily, mixed between websites and RSS feed (Tech, AI, Web, Crypto, Platform Engineering).
* **The ""Human"" Bottleneck:** I didn't want pure AI slop, so I built a workflow where the Go script grabs the raw data, but I spend **\~2 hours every single day** manually reviewing and picking the top 12-14 stories for each category.

**The ""Meta"" Upgrade:**  
Ironically, while curating articles for the digest, I kept reading about new open-source audio tools. I stumbled across **Chatterbox TTS** (an open-source model that outperforms many paid APIs) and decided to test it on my Mac.

The results were actually good. So, I expanded the Golang pipeline to feed my curated, hand-edited scripts into Chatterbox to clone a ""host"" voice. I pick from the 14 articles around 5-6 to be discussed in the podcast. 

It’s been a fun way to learn the limits of local inference. You can hear the latest episode here:

I built a pressure-relief sound for brain fog and overload.. looking for coders/founders to tell me if it actually works.,"what's going on everyone!

I’ve been building solo for a while, and one thing kept hitting me harder than bugs or deadlines: cognitive overload.

  
Long coding sessions, constant context switching, and shipping under pressure would fry my brain to the point where I couldn’t think straight.

Brain fog, loops, decision paralysis… that “my head feels full” feeling.

Nothing I tried worked.  
Meditation felt too slow.  
Focus music barely moved the needle.  
Productivity hacks weren’t solving the *actual* problem.

So I started experimenting with engineered soundscapes not meditation, not lofi, not binaural beats.

  
More like nervous system resets designed to drop pressure and clear mental static fast.

And weirdly… they worked.  
For me at least.

I’d go from fogged -> clear in under a minute.

But I had no idea if this was just placebo or if I stumbled into something real, so I built a small app and a free 3 minute demo to see if it helps anyone besides me.

# The Problem

Most founders and builders deal with:

* mental overload
* brain fog during deep work
* pressure spikes
* decision fatigue
* “stuck in a loop” moments
* feeling cooked but still trying to ship

But nothing actually helps in the moment except taking long breaks which kills momentum.

I wanted something fast.

# The Solution

I built **DoNothingSounds**  a tiny tool with sound based resets engineered for overloaded founders:

* 3 minute “reset” tracks
* Built for fog, overload, loops, anxiety spikes
* Designed to interrupt pressure, not calm you into a nap
* Minimal UI, immersive experience
* No signup required for the demo
* 10 second feedback form to see if anything shifted

It’s not about focus.  
It’s about clearing the static so you can think again.

# How It Works

I use very specific sound patterns, textures, and frequency behaviours that consistently hit my nervous system and stop the “jammed brain” feeling.

The demo includes:

* shipping to fast
* can't stop 
* the dread of marketing
* twelve tabs open

(Names simplified here.)

Just put on real headphones, pick a track, and see if it does anything.

# Tech Details

* React frontend
* Custom audio engine
* Tailwind for the experience layer
* Sound designed in Ableton + custom plugins
* Tally for fast feedback loops
* Minimal tracking (just what track you listened to)

Super small, simple, intentional.

# What I Learned

* Founders don’t need calm  they need clarity *fast*
* Sound can hit the nervous system way quicker than I expected
* Most people underestimate how much cognitive overload kills execution
* Building minimal is harder than adding more features
* Effects are real for me, but I need data to know if it works for others

struggling to convince people to test my product,"Hi guys

I was observing the market of autonomous professionals (PT, teachers, etc) and I noticed one problem: all professionals that sell a recurrence service (where their clients pay a monthly fee) have problem with delinquency

There is a gap on the market

1. Here in Brazil the service is sold using Pix, a direct transfer method that doesnt have take rate, but it also doesnt have any kind of pre planned recurrency
2. **E**RPs are expensive and feels like a megazord

  
Im building Penny to be a MVP to solve this scenario: its a simple checkout with charging automation directly on whatsapp. The professional no long has to speak with its client, spend time, charging them. Also, he has a more clean control of who payed and who hasnt. Actually, he does this control manually on a sheet.

My hipothesis: that professional doesnt want another interface to manage and, most importantly, make INPUTS. He just want to receive, charge and manage payments with minimum friction

The business model will be take rate, with no monthly fee.. So you pay as you use.

I'd like to check with you: For those who provide recurring services here, is the need to manually charge and manage payments a real pain point, or am I biased?

Anyone who wants to test the MVP and help me with this discovery, send me a direct message!",VehicleVast8329,1pcp75e,SideProject,03-12-2025,00:14:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pcp75e/struggling_to_convince_people_to_test_my_product/
Hit 50 users using this simple Reddit Traction Method,"I didn’t start with a launch, landing page, or ads.  
  
I started with Reddit.

And somehow, Reddit became the only channel that consistently delivered users for my micro SaaS, enough that I hit 50 paying users using nothing but a repeatable discussion-based method.

Here’s the exact method I used:

**Post problems, not products.**

Whenever I posted about what I was trying to solve, instead of what I built, the conversations exploded.  
  
People respond to challenges, not pitches.

Reddit rewards authenticity more than any other platform.

**Turn conversation into a loop, not a pitch.**

My only “growth engine” was:

Insight → discussion → pitch → user  
  
Just letting value do the work.  


**Track subreddits where your audience naturally gathers.**

I made a small internal script to monitor:

niche subreddit discussions

specific problem-keywords

trending questions

unanswered threads in my niche

This alone showed me where to contribute instead of guessing.

**Revisit past conversations.**

Reddit comments don’t die, they age like SEO.

Every 2–7 days I’d revisit:

older threads

new replies

related discussions

The more I engaged organically, the more Reddit surfaced my comments.

This became a silent acquisition channel.

**I automated the repetitive parts.**

The consistency was hard to maintain manually, so I built a tool to systemize the method.

It tracked:

drafts

subreddit triggers

comment threads

response opportunities

It was originally just for myself.  
  
But once I hit 50 users using this method, other founders asked for access and that’s how the tool became a micro SaaS.

**The biggest lesson:**

You don’t need a massive launch.  
  
You need a repeatable conversation method that leads people to discover what you built.

Reddit works if you treat it like an insight engine, not a billboard.

Happy to break down any part of this if it helps anyone here.

I built a geospatial query API and used it to make a real-time ISS tracker,"**Demo:** [https://dev-jeb.com/deliberate/portal/showcase/iss-tracker](https://dev-jeb.com/deliberate/portal/showcase/iss-tracker)  
**Docs:** [https://dev-jeb.com/deliberate/portal/docs](https://dev-jeb.com/deliberate/portal/docs)

# What I Built

**Deliberate API** \- A geospatial query platform that lets you ask questions like:

* ""Which country/state/county/etc contains this point?""
* ""What geographic area intersects/is a subset of some other geographical area?

# The ISS Tracker Demo

To showcase the API, I built a real-time ISS tracker that:

1. Fetches ISS position every 10 seconds
2. Queries my API: ""What geographic sets contain this lat/lng?""
3. Streams results to the browser via SSE

**The actual query is just:** 

    { ""where"": 
      { ""spatial"": 
        { ""contains_point"": 
          { 
            ""lat"": 25.7617, 
            ""lng"": -80.1918 
          } 
        } 
      } 
    }

  
  
Returns all countries, states, counties, oceans, seas, national parks etc. that contain the point.

# Current Data Available

* World countries
* US states & counties
* National parks
* Some Ocean terminals & ports
* Oceans, seas, gulfs, bays
* More coming (happy to take requests)

# Why I Built This

I am a software developer by day and really want to build a tool that others use and enjoy. This started and continues to be a hobby project that I want to bring to others.

# Tech Stack

* FastAPI backend
* Planetscale
* Pulumi
* Uber H3
* Next.js frontend for development portal

Still in beta but the API is free to use. Would love feedback from anyone who works with geospatial data.

Also, feel free to ask any technical questions. I am always down to talk software.

Here is an example of a geographical set in my system. I give you the Appalachian Trail

"A few days back I started building this app… now it’s finished, but I’m scared to publish it. What should I do?","Hey everyone,
So a few days ago I randomly started building an app just out of curiosity. I honestly didn’t think it would turn into something real, but I kept working on it every day and now it’s basically done. And as soon as I reached the finish line, a weird fear kicked in.

Now I’m scared to publish it.

I keep thinking… what if nobody downloads it? What if people don’t find it usef? What if it deosn’t perform the way I imagine in my head? I spent so much time building it that the idea of it failing in silence is stressing me more than the actual development ever did.

The app itself is something I personally wish existed amd I couldn't find one. It’s a camera that can record the past. It continuously buffers video in the background, so even if something happens suddenly and I press record late, the app still saves the previous moments. It’s useful for capturing unexpected moments, sports highlights, accidents, gameplay reactions, TikTok-style content, anything that happens too quickly to catch in time.

It supports 1080p and goes up to 4K on devices that can handle it. You can adjust how many seconds of the past you want to save. It works smoothly and the UI feels pretty clean. In short, it actually works the way I hoped it would.

But even after all this, I’m just stuck thinking, what if it gets zero downloads? Or what if it goes completely unnoticed? I don’t know if this fear is normal or if I’m overthinking it.

So I wanted to ask the community that, 
Has anyone else felt this right before launching something?
Should I just publish it and learn from whatever happens?
Do apps like this even have a chance of getting traction?
Any advice or perspective would really help.

I built a super simple invoicing tool for solo developers because I never used 90% of the features in other ones.,"Hey everyone! 

I’ve been doing freelance dev work on the side for years, and one thing has always annoyed me every invoicing tool wants $15–30/month… just to send a few invoices a month.

Most solo devs (myself included) don’t need proposals, CRM, payroll, bookkeeping, 9 integrations, or AI robots that summarize receipts. We just need:

* create invoice
* send invoice
* track if it’s paid
* set recurring invoices
* export for taxes

That’s it. When I couldn't find it at a reasonable price I built it.

* Create & email invoices
* Time tracking
* Recurring invoices
* Auto reminders
* View payment history
* Export at year-end
* No clutter, no upsells

And the whole thing is **$20/year** instead of $20/month.

I built it because I was tired of paying 10–20× more for features I never used. Just looking for some brutal honesty and feedback before I spend any more time working on it.

20 year old building an iOS app that re-sparks friendships.,"Hello everyone, I wanted to post on here to share my latest project. For some context on who I am, I’m a 20-y/o from Oregon, but I go to a small college in California where I’m taking a Nursing program. This all started when at the beggining of the year I was on a work shift at my dorms front desk, when I saw a video about a guy who made a mobile app by learning how to code with ChatGPT. I was amazed by the idea but also super skeptical that you could actually make an app with AI. So like every other “make $$$ online” trend I decided I would try it. Besides I would probably figure out it would be too hard anyways. My first idea was a gamified Bible app. I stated building, and got hooked to making the UI. But 3 months later of building everything was falling apart. I hit a bug that I couldn’t solve after 2 weeks of trying everything. I was devastated, but I finally realized I was way in over my head. I was building with the wrong language, wrong setup, everything. I overestimated what I could do as a beginner and quit the project after spending at least 100 hours on it. Like any other project or phase I started, I was deciding I was going to quit. Making an app was just too hard. However, as you can see that’s not how the story ended. A couple of weeks later I got a spark of an idea in my head that made me so excited. It was for another app and made me just as excited as when I got the idea for the Bible app. I thought “what if there was an app like BeReal, but instead of daily pictures, you would get a daily question?” After doing a little bit of research I didn’t find any exact app. Then I came to a decision. “Should I give this my all and risk failing and wasting time again, or should I just quit.” Something inside of me told me I needed to change. So again, I started building. This time more strategic and carefully. And week by week I was slowly seeing my vision of this app come to life. And it was actually working! And while there was tons of bugs at every step that felt impossible to understand and solve, for some reason I didn’t give up this time. And here we are. 5 months later, I’m finally able to say that I have released my first app on the App Store. I know it’s not the craziest thing, but for me it’s a huge accomplishment because it has been a journey of crushing my self doubt. I prayed for this so much, and all I can do is thank God. Anyways, this wasn’t meant to be a self-reflection, but here we are. I’m just super happy. Even if no one uses it and it still has some bugs, I’m still going to keep making it better. If you want to try it and give me some feedback that would be super helpful for me! It’s called Circles - Know Your People on the Apple App Store. I’m constantly improving the app so it can be more aligned with my vision. I’m hoping to build an actually fun social app you can use with your friends that helps spark new conversation and know each other better. If you read until here you’re awesome 😂.

Code-review tool and Git client,"Code-review tooling sucks.

So I built something for myself, that I'm now putting out there.

I call it 'Critiq'.     
Critiq is everything I want in a code-review tool. It has all of the git functionality for reviewing my own shit.  

It has branch comparison mode, for when a homie needs a quick review before pushing a PR.  

It even has PR review mode for the OAuth providers (gitlab, github and bitbucket so far).  

But what it also has is a full file explorer, bring your own AI (gemini, claude, openai, lm studio or an embedded qwen 7b).  

Triage diff hunks, generate commit messages, Explain code.  

Navigate most things directly from the keyboard (up/down diff hunks, files, stage, unstage, history back and forth).  

Global symbol search.  

Full LSP support (also in the diff views. YES!) meaning you simply hook up the lsps you need and itll hook into them (via config).

my first SaaS flopped - but it gave me an idea I'm excited about! would you use this?,"hey guys so i just wrapped up my first SaaS journey

20 days of building! i shipped auth, webhooks, SSL automation and learned alot.  
but 2 signups and $0 revenue taught me the real lesson: I spent too much time coding as i fell in love with the idea and not enough time was spent validating (classic beginner mistake 😅)

however, i don't regret it - i still see this as a personal success. 2 months ago I couldn't even deploy to production. now i've shipped a full product and learned more than any course could teach me.

but learning from this lesson i've got a new idea (and this time i'll be validating it 😉)

here's the general run-down of the idea:

* it validates your idea upfront (competitors, reddit communities, market data)
* creates a 2 to 4-week roadmap with marketing milestones baked in
* gentle gates that encourage you to validate before building (e.g. ""get x amount of waitlist emails before diving into code"", ""send out x amount of posts and get real traction"", ""have x amount of conversation with potential users"")
* daily check-ins to keep you on track: ""Did you post today? Any responses?""
* honest feedback on when to pivot or keep pushing - based on real traction

its just i know how easy it is to keep building and get invested into an idea without any validation from people to back it up - especially with vibe coding now!

it's kind of like having a supportive co-founder who keeps you focused on what matters

my question: would something like this have helped you? would you use it?

I built a simple payment tracker MVP in 3 days because I was tired of Excel,"Hey everyone!

So I got sick of manually tracking my spending across Revolut and my Polish bank (PKO BP) in Excel every month. Spent a weekend building Paylio -  just drop your CSV files and see where your money went.

Link: [https://paylio.azurewebsites.net/](https://paylio.azurewebsites.net/)

Right now it only works with Revolut and PKO BP (Polish bank), but I want to add more banks based on what people actually need.

The Problem You know the drill:

•	Download CSV from diffrent Bank

•	Import both into Excel

•	Spend time to formatting everything

•	Try to figure out ""wait, how much did I spend on food last month?""

•	Next month: do it all over again because you forgot to save your pivot tables

I just wanted a simple answer: ""**Show me where my money went.**""

What I Built Used Blazor and .NET 10 to throw together an MVP. It does the job:

**CSV Upload** \- Supports Revolut and PKO BP right now

**Auto-parsing** \- Each bank formats their CSVs differently, Paylio figures it out

**Grouping** \- See spending by merchant, by date, or by month

**Search** \- Find any transaction instantly

**Basic Stats** \- Totals, averages, min/max - the stuff you actually care about

**Private** \- Google login, your data stays yours

Looking for:

•	Any other pain points with tracking spending across multiple accounts

Drop a comment what features would help! Building this based on actual feedback, not what I think people might want.

Are SaaS teams doing too many repetitive demos?,"I’ve been talking to a lot of SaaS founders and sales teams lately, and one pattern keeps showing up:

The problem isn’t that prospects don’t understand the product.  
It’s that teams are doing the same product walkthrough 10–20 times every week.

The first demo is always useful.  
The next dozen are usually repetitive, time-consuming, and slow down the pipeline.

It made me realize that the real bottleneck isn’t “demo clarity,”  
but the repetition behind every product tour.

Big moves are happening in the world of business and AI is leading the charge,"I’ve seen how AI isn’t just a tool, it's a partner that helps businesses work smarter, faster, and more efficiently. Imagine a tireless assistant that learns as it goes, spots problems before they happen, and handles repetitive tasks so your team can focus on what truly matters. It finds patterns we’d never notice, helps make smarter decisions, and keeps operations running smoothly every day.

Here’s what recent data shows about AI and business.

➤ Around 78% of organizations now use AI in at least one business function. 

 ➤ Firms most exposed to AI have seen productivity growth jump nearly four‑fold in recent years. 

 ➤ Companies using AI report significantly higher revenue per employee compared to less AI‑exposed firms, almost 3× more. 

 ➤ Many businesses using AI say it helps reduce repetitive work, cut mistakes, boost accuracy, and speed up responses. 

From protecting your business with real‑time threat detection to optimizing resources and improving customer experience, AI quietly powers success behind the scenes. When humans and AI collaborate, workloads lighten, innovation accelerates, and possibilities multiply.

I believe that businesses that embrace AI now aren’t just keeping up, they’re getting ahead. AI doesn’t replace us it serves us, freeing us to create, innovate, and grow in ways that weren’t possible before.",wajahat-akdkhan,1pclrnt,SideProject,02-12-2025,21:53:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pclrnt/big_moves_are_happening_in_the_world_of_business/
"To help me out with my productivity issues, I built my own Pomodoro web app with music, and I'm wondering for your feedback","Just launched a side project I've been working on: LoFlow ([www.loflow.me](http://www.loflow.me)).

The backstory: I got diagnosed with ADHD at 40 (fun times) and noticed that music really helped me tap into hyperfocus mode. But I kept getting distracted switching between timer apps and music apps. Classic.

So I built a simple PWA that combines both: Pomodoro timer + integrated lo-fi/instrumental playlists. Built it using what I'm calling ""Vibe Coding"" — basically letting the flow guide the development (which felt fitting given the product).

Tech stack: Flask backend, PWA with service workers and push notifications. Freemium model with some premium playlists.

Looking for feedback on the product and happy to chat about the build process if anyone's curious.

I just created a WhatsApp API that doesn't require a VPS.,"No, you didn't misunderstand, I literally created a WhatsApp API, completely free, with multi-session capabilities that runs on Node.js.

The Node.js module is commonly available on various shared hosting providers, which simplifies installation and significantly reduces costs.

I literally automated my WhatsApp by installing n8n and NodeWaha on my shared hosting, paying a mere $20 a year.

I'm adding more functions to it; I want to add the ""see"" function, which is the function that marks the blue checkmarks. And some other functions as well. However, the main thing, which is sending and receiving messages, it's already doing.

I implemented it in my roasted chicken business, and now I have an online assistant who makes pre-reservations according to my stock, making my life much easier.

As soon as I'm satisfied with it and see that it really isn't showing any bugs, I'll create a website so people can download and use it.

"Burnt out from too many Apps..,","Microsoft Research found that the average knowledge worker switches between apps nearly 1,200 times per day. Each switch costs about 23 minutes to fully recover your focus.

If you're using separate apps for tasks, calendars, journaling, habit tracking, and focus sessions, you're not building a productivity system. You're building a context-switching nightmare.

**The fragmented attention problem**

Cal Newport calls this ""attention residue"" in *Deep Work*. Your brain doesn't multitask; it rapidly switches contexts, and each switch leaves cognitive debris that makes you worse at the next thing.

Check Todoist for tasks. Switch to Toggl for time tracking. Jump to Notion for notes. Open Headspace for meditation. Back to Google Calendar for planning.

You're spending more time managing tools than actually doing the work.

**What actually works**

David Allen's Getting Things Done emphasizes *trusted systems.* Singular, not plural. The most productive people don't use more tools, they use fewer, better-integrated ones.

Your brain works better when related information lives together. When your daily tasks sit next to your reflection, you learn from patterns. When your focus sessions connect to your goals, you see what's working.

**The framework:**

* Capture everything in one place
* Connect actions to outcomes
* Reduce friction (3 seconds to log, not 30)
* Make progress visible

I got so frustrated with this fragmentation that I built [Clay](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clay-goals-social-rewards/id6740754275) to solve it for myself. It's an all-in-one system that handles tasks, focus timers, journaling, habit tracking, and planning in one interface, plus fitness, budgeting, and other life stuff because productivity isn't just work.

The main thing: everything connects. Your completed tasks flow into your journal prompts. Your focus sessions tie to your goals. You see patterns across your whole life, not just fragments.

If this resonates and you want to try consolidating your system, I'm offering 30% off our premium tier to this community. Just comment below.

But honestly, the bigger point stands regardless of what tool you use: **stop optimizing your productivity system and start using it.** Consolidate where you can. Your brain will thank you.",OddPanda17,1pcllrg,SideProject,02-12-2025,21:47:20,https://i.redd.it/xuoysavo2v4g1.jpeg

This is what happens when you make your plan super simple,"Hi!

**Now:** Download 200 books / day.

After 18 years in the marine shipping industry, I made a massive career pivot into programming. I've been ""vibe coding"" with Flutter and recently deployed 3 apps to the Play Store.

One of them, **Invoice Swift**, just got a massive update (v2.0), and I’m looking for feedback on the new monetization model.

I built this because I needed a fast, no-nonsense invoicing tool that worked offline (internet can be spotty here).

**What’s New in v2.0:**

* **Offline Mode:** Create invoices without a connection; auto-syncs when you're back online.
* **Smart Reminders:** Automatically notifies you 7 days or 24h before an invoice is due (so you get paid faster).
* **Premium Wall:** I introduced a monthly/yearly subscription to remove ads and unlock themes.

I spent way too much time looking for the perfect wallpaper...,"Ok so idk if it's just me but I've spent way too many hours trying to find a wallpaper that actually matches my phone case and my current vibe. You know what I mean? Like scrolling through Pinterest, Unsplash, random wallpaper apps... and nothing feels right or 2 of 100 I'll actually save on my phone.

So a couple of months ago I was like ""screw it, I'm a software developer, I'll just make something myself."" The idea is simple - you pick colors (or let it grab them from a photo), and it generates unique abstract wallpapers. Every generation is different so you can keep going until something clicks.

Showed it to a close friends and they actually wanted to use it, so I figured maybe others might find it useful too?

It's called 'CaseMagic: AI wallpaper maker' and it's free to try on iOS..and only iOS for now, sorry Android mates, nothing personal.

One catch though - it uses Apple Intelligence for generation, so you need a newer iPhone that supports it (15 Pro and up I think).

If your iPhone doesn't support Apple Intelligence but you'd want something like this - let me know in comments or in the app (it has feature request functionality). If there's enough interest I'll look into alternative ways to make it work for older models.

I've attached some examples of generated images by the app so you can right away decide should you skip it or not 🌚

Built an app that generates customizable DIY weekend projects (with AR). Would love feedback.,"Hey folks — I’ve been working on this side project for the past few months and would love feedback from other builders.

**Fixie — Your DIY Assistant**

App Store: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fixie-your-diy-assistant/id6747016929](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fixie-your-diy-assistant/id6747016929)

# What I originally built (and why it didn’t work)

Fixie started as a DIY *repair* assistant. My idea was that better UX + structured flows could outperform a raw LLM when you’re trying to fix something in the real world.

After a few months, I had to admit the truth:

* sometimes it worked,
* but most of the time it was only marginally better than ChatGPT,
* and occasionally it was more frustrating (loops, misidentification, hallucinated steps).

Not worth doubling down.

# Why I pivoted

I noticed people struggle less with repairing and more with *building* things from scratch.

Reels make DIY look simple but skip all the real details.

PDF plans on Etsy are static and rarely adapt to your space or tools.

So I pivoted Fixie into an app for **customizable, step-by-step weekend projects** — something between a woodworking plan, a build tutorial, and a project assistant.

# What Fixie does now

* Customizable dimensions
* Clear BOM + accurate cut list
* One-click ordering for tools/materials
* Step-by-step build instructions
* Everything updates dynamically (no static PDFs)
* **AR features** so you can preview dimensions, visualize the project in your space, or see where things should go before cutting



There are only a few projects live right now — still validating UX and figuring out how detailed the instructions should be — but I’d love honest feedback from this community.

No logins or installs or anything like that. You just share a link with the group and everyone swipes the same stuff. If you all match on something, it shows it.

If you want to try it or break it, it’s at https://chewsr.com. I’m mostly curious if the flow feels smooth or if anything is confusing or slow. I’ve been staring at it too long, so outside eyes help a lot.

"Here’s how to give your customers pricing clarity, especially the enterprise ones","Most companies start with simple pricing. But the moment you land real enterprise customers, everything fragments: every big customer negotiates different discounts, thresholds, exceptions etc. And the real problem isn’t even complexity — it’s inconsistency. Once the numbers stop matching, trust drops, usage lags, renewals stall, and expansion stops before it starts.

Big players like Azure, AWS etc. already know this. They invest millions into their pricing calculators because **pre-transaction price estimation directly improves acquisition, qualification, and trust**. But for everyone else, building something even close to that in-house is unrealistic.

I've built a Formula One predictions league website as a hobby project,"Hi all,

Over the last few months I’ve built an F1 predictions game website, named Podium Predictions League, where you make race predictions before each F1 race weekend to compete in the main league, or join mini-leagues with friends and track your scores throughout the season to try to get on the podium or work your way up the leaderboard.

I originally created it because I’d been running the exact same game for friends for a couple of years using Excel and it was hard work! This year I've had around 20 friends using it all season and it’s been working really well. It literally now takes seconds after each race to calculate the results and be ready for the next race.

If anyone wants to try it out, there is only one race left this season to give it a go before I set things up again ready for the next season early in the new year.

Here’s the link if you're curious:  
[**https://PodiumPredictions.com**](https://PodiumPredictions.com)

All you need to register is a player name, a password and an email address, which is only needed for password resets and for the pre-qualifying deadline email reminders, which can be turned off in the settings.

It’s all built from scratch in PHP + MariaDB on shared hosting.  I'd love to get feedback from people outside of my friends group.

I’d really appreciate any feedback on usability and layout. It's my first attempt at building any type of website, although I do have a background in IT which has definitely helped quite a bit!

Thanks to anyone who gives it a look and, if you like it, maybe you will want to play the full season next year!",F1TechCoder,1pciphk,SideProject,02-12-2025,19:58:14,https://i.redd.it/dkoedh9eiu4g1.png

"I used to spend 30 minutes a day catching up on gmail & slack, so I built an app to send me recaps every morning","Link: [https://www.trydebrief.com/](https://www.trydebrief.com/) 

Used to be a PM. Started each day catching up on Slack, Gmail, and double-checking stuff like JIRA, Google Docs, etc...

This app, Debrief, connect to your work apps and sends you recaps for each thing you're tracking, like a sprint's progress, employee performance, whatever. 

Quick overview:

* Setup takes \~1 minute
* Connects to Slack, Gmail (more coming)
* Each ""thread"" gets its own independent recap 
* End-to-end encrypted, SOC 2 in progress

Example in the video is: Instead of asking ""how's Mike's onboarding going?"", I get a daily summary that in this case summarizes 14 Slack messages across a bunch of channels and email threads I'm tagged on automatically.

Built my first Discord bot and definitely over-complicated it,"Started with a simple time tracking bot. Then thought ""managing everything through commands sucks"" so I built a full web dashboard. Now I'm coordinating two separate repos, two deployment platforms, and a shared database.

**Setup:**

* Bot (Discord.js + TypeScript) on Railway
* Dashboard (Laravel + Vue + Inertia) on Forge
* Bot calls dashboard API for config, writes data to Supabase

Features: /checkin /checkout, breaks, projects, leaderboards, web analytics, privacy settings.

Hardest part? Keeping two codebases in sync. Change the dashboard? Better hope the bot handles it. Learning Discord.js and Railway simultaneously while coordinating deploys was fun.

Now I know this architecture works before building a more complex project (full server management bot).

Anyone else doing Discord bot + separate dashboard? How do you handle coordination?

My project (AI-powered personalized zodiac PDFs) had 10 paying customers in 2 months + a hard lesson about Indian traffic. Here’s the unglamorous truth.,"Like half of you, I got sucked into the “*digital products = easy money*” YouTube vortex.

There was this guy that bragged about $1k in a week, “*no ads, built in 48 hours*”, etc. So I actually went ahead and built it: [Zodicy.com](https://www.zodicy.com), personalized zodiac PDF reports powered by AI

https://preview.redd.it/c8zrbof39u4g1.png?width=3105&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e5dd2e89e30bb877bb5285530b1d0421588e4f9

**Real stats** after 2 months live:

* Built in \~90 hours total (me + one designer) over evenings/weekends
* Pricing: $15 / $30 one-time (15–20 page reports)
* 9 paying customers → \~$220 total revenue
* Spent \~$150 on Meta/TikTok ads + small Render/LLM costs
* Those ads got me \~500 quiz completions… 95% from India
* Final conversion to sale: <2% (Stripe + international cards = instant bounce)

**Lesson #1:** Indian traffic is dirt cheap but mostly non-monetizable with Stripe right now. Hundreds of people happily filled out the 10-question quiz, got to the checkout, saw ""pay with card"" and bounced. I basically ran a charity birth-chart service for college students in Mumbai!

**Lesson #2:** The soul-crushing part the gurus never show: watching 500 people happily go through your beautiful quiz, get excited, then ghost at checkout.

**But here’s what keeps me going**: 9 people from US/UK/Australia still paid real money for an AI-generated zodiac report. That’s undeniable signal in a $10B+ passion category.

**Next move** (launching this week):  
Pivoting hard to subscription before I run out of motivation:

* Turning it into a proper subscription product instead of one-time pay-to-download:
* $9/mo or $69/year → ""Cosmic Club""
* Daily transit email (2 lines + emoji)
* Monthly 15-page deep-dive PDF
* Members-only Discord / live Q&As
* Dashboard & full archive of all past reports

Astrology people are addicts, they could pay $9/mo forever to get their daily fix.

**Takeaways** so far:

* Yes, you can build and launch a decent-looking digital product in <100 hours in 2025.
* AI is insane leverage.
* Distribution is still 90% of the battle.
* Tier-2/3 countries traffic is worthless with Stripe-only checkout.
* One-time PDFs feel scammy in 2025, subscription feels like value.

If anyone here has experience monetizing Indian traffic without Stripe (PayPal, Razorpay, crypto?) DM me, happy to discuss.

Will be back in January with the update post: ""I hit $1k MRR"" or ""I quit"".

My app just hit 2k downloads!,"Thought this would be a fun share. I checked my lifetime analytics today and saw that I cracked 2,000 downloads! I'm stoked

As I've been improving the app, things have been getting a lot easier. I'm consistently talking to users, having purchases come in, getting positive and constructive feedback.

I thought it would be helpful to share some of what I've learned during this process.

1. Talk to users, talk to users, talk to users, find a way to talk to users. They WILL NOT use the app the way you expected.

2. UX/UI MATTERS! People want an app that feels premium and are willing to overlook bugs and issues if the app feels nice enough.

3. It will take time. It took a while to make onboarding good enough that people would happily pay for the app. And I'm a software engineer by trade. Be patient with yourself.

4. Try to wait for someone to ask for a feature before you build it. Or find a way to validate that people want it. I have an easier time building cool stuff that no one wants than I do talking to customers. But that doesn't work.

Offering something I wish existed when I launched — 30 days of free SEO growth for early builders,"I built something because I was tired of launching projects nobody ever saw.

If you’ve ever:

• shipped a site you believe in  
• but Google acts like you don’t exist  
• and you feel like you’re talking into the void

# What I’m offering

I’m looking for **10 beta testers** who want a **free 30-day traffic/content push** for their site —

✔ No credit card  
✔ No upsell  
✔ No strings

You get full access — I just ask for honest feedback.

# What it actually does

It automates the **entire SEO/content workflow**:

• researches your niche  
• finds keywords (including competitor gaps)  
• creates long-form, \~3,000-word human-style articles  
• optimises them for both traditional Google search **and emerging AI search platforms**  
• links them together for topical authority  
• and auto-publishes to WordPress/Webflow with scheduling

Basically, the “boring but necessary” SEO work no builder actually wants to do.

# Why I built it

Modern SEO isn’t about stuffing keywords — it’s about:

✔ topical depth  
✔ better internal linking  
✔ consistency  
✔ satisfying ranking signals *across both search engines and AI assistants*

I realised nobody is building for this new “AI search era,” so I did.

# Who it’s ideal for

• new or invisible websites  
• SaaS / indie apps  
• blogs without time for content  
• founders trying to get early traction  
• agencies testing offers

# If you want in

Just comment your URL or say **“I’m in”** and I’ll DM you.

I’ll onboard the first 10 people.

"I fed my PostHog user session recordings, user interview docs, analytics screenshot to my app and it did something super crazy!!","I wanted to dig deep into some user drop-off metrics we were seeing. Usually, this means days of cross-referencing data. Instead, I decided to dogfood Sudosu to analyze the product itself.  
  
I fed the AI a massive mix of unstructured and structured data:  
  
\- PostHog session replays (actual video of users clicking around)  
  
\- Analytics screenshots showing the drop-off funnels  
  
\- User interview notes regarding friction points  
  
The result?  
It automatically generated a detailed Root Cause Analysis (RCA) document that connected dots I hadn't even seen yet.  
  
Look at the screenshot attached. The AI didn't just summarize; it correlated the video evidence with the analytics.  
  
It pinpointed specific UX stressors like:  
1. Post-Creation Disconnect - It noticed users were creating a diagram, hitting a loading state, and immediately retreating to the dashboard because they lacked confidence the file was actually created.  
  
2. Re-entry Redundancy - Identify extra clicks that were inflating our session times without adding value.  
  
3. Blank Canvas Paralysis - Highlighting where users froze up when faced with an empty screen.  
It turned hours of manual detective work into an instant, actionable strategy doc.

I'm building a super-fast 3D mockup tool for designers & devs — would love your brutal feedback (and honest thoughts on a one-time purchase),"Hey r/SideProject!

After getting tired of clunky or overpriced 3D mockup tools, I spent the last few months building something ridiculously fast and actually fun to use.

It’s a web app that lets you:

* Drag & drop your screenshots/artwork
* Choose from different devices & scenes (iMacs, iPhones, MacBooks, watches).
* Customise and create any animation with keyframe timeline support.
* Export 4K PNG or MP4 animation in less than 1 mins.

Best part: everything runs in the browser with WebGL + Three.js, zero uploads.

* Works great on desktop (Chrome/Edge/Firefox)
* Working at mobile support
* Working on adding more devices and scenes.

**My big question for you all:**

Would you actually pay for something like this with a one-time fee (lifetime updates included)?

I’m thinking somewhere in the $49–$89 range depending on the final feature set (no subscriptions, ever).

If it’s useful but the price feels off, tell me straight — I’d rather hear “dude that’s too expensive for what it is” now than after launch, lol.

It would help me a ton if you try it for a few minutes and tell me: •	What confused you 
•	What features you’d want added 
•	Whether the price feels fair 
•	If anything feels buggy

Got fed up with signature sheets so I built a fast free no login tool,"

Hey everyone,

After going to a bunch of lectures and events, I kept running into the same two problems with attendance:

1. It takes way too long (signature sheets, manual check-ins, long lines)  
2. It’s super easy to fake (someone just sends a QR code to their friend)

So I built a small service to fix both issues.  
The idea: keep the speed of QR scanning, but make it secure with a location check, so attendance only counts if you’re actually near the event.

It’s still early, but I have a working demo and a simple website.  
The demo is free and doesn’t require any signup.

If anyone wants to try it out, I’d love to hear your thoughts or suggestions!

I built a simple player prop tool and want honest feedback. Free month if you want to try it.,"Hey everyone. I’ve been building a simple player prop analytics app designed for casual bettors who don’t want to spend hours researching every pick. Most tools in this space cost anywhere from 20 to 200 a month and are built for heavy users. My goal was to make something clean, easy to understand, and priced at 4.99 a month.

I’m not trying to sell anything here. I just want to know what works well, what doesn’t, and what would make this more helpful for you on a daily basis. The app is live and I’m actively improving it, so real user feedback actually matters.

If you want to try it out, I’ll give you a full free month. No card required. I only ask that you tell me what feels confusing, what you expected but didn’t see, or what would make it more valuable.

If this post isn’t allowed, mods can remove it. If you’re interested, drop a comment and I’ll DM you the link.

Need some honest eyes on landing pages? I can help.,"Hey folks,  
I’ve been helping a couple of small founders and creators with their landing pages lately, and I’m seeing the same issue again and again.

A lot of people know what they want to build… but when it comes to actually putting the page together, they get stuck on simple stuff like:

– what to write in the first section  
– how to organize the page so it doesn’t feel messy  
– what to keep and what to remove  
– how to make the page feel clean instead of crowded  
– how to make sure people don’t bounce in 3 seconds

I’m not here to sell anything.  
If you’re working on a project, launching something soon, or just stuck on your page layout, I don’t mind taking a look and giving you some honest thoughts.

If you have a draft or even a rough sketch, share a screenshot or describe it.  
I’ll try my best to help you shape it into something clearer.

Not a pro designer or anything… just sharing what’s been working for me recently.

I built SnapClipper - a one-click web clipper with AI tagging.,"Hi r/SideProject!   
  
I'm excited to share SnapClipper, a Chrome extension I built to solve a personal problem.  


**The Problem:**   
I was losing important articles, research, and inspiration while browsing. My bookmarks were a mess. Organizing manually took forever. The existing extensions and solutions all required Notion, OneNote, or were just clunky.



**The Solution:**   
I built SnapClipper to save web content in one click with AI-powered organization.



**How it works:**

1. Highlight text on any website
2. Right-click ""Save to SnapClipper""
3. Text immediately captured. If desired, all formatting and screenshots also captured. 
4. Links to source material retained.
5. AI auto-tags it (Research, Inspiration, Code, Quotes, etc.)
6. Search dashboard to find anything in seconds
7. All content stored locally and exportable/importable at any time. Copy content, export as markdown or JSON.

  
I am personally using it to capture and tag AI prompts, Christmas wish lists



**Tech Stack:**

* React + TypeScript
* Chrome Extension API
* IndexedDB for local storage
* TensorFlow.js for AI tagging (MVP)



**Monetization:**

* 7 day Free version (all features)
* $19.99/year pro license
* Targeting $50k+ Year 1 revenue



**Lessons Learned:**

* One-click simplicity with no vendor tie-in is a huge differentiator
* Privacy-first (local storage) resonates with users

I built a tool that turns user selfies into clinical-style skin analysis reports (instead of studying for my medical exams),"Hey everyone, I’m a 2nd-year medical student. I’ve been working on a side project where I wrote my own code to turn simple smartphone selfies into detailed, clinical-grade skin analysis reports with the actual dermatological parameters mapped out.

It started as a personal thing to avoid studying for Pathology, but after seeing my hostel-mates ruin their face with random products, I realized everyone was just guessing about their skin type. I wanted something that acted like a ""pre-check"" before seeing a doctor, so I built a pipeline that pulls visual data from the image, maps the skin texture against medical benchmarks (like erythema and sebum levels), and generates a triage report.

I also manually coded the logic to translate the medical jargon into simple advice.

So far I’ve got it detecting:

• Sebum (Oiliness) levels
• Active Acne vs. Scarring
• Dehydration markers
• Skin Texture irregularities

I built the whole thing using vanilla HTML/JS and the OpenAI API from my hostel room. Let me know what you think!

"Went viral and reached 1400 MRR from my Sora watermark remover and upscaler tool, now added bulk subtitles for short form videos . What should I automate next?","A few weeks ago I posted on Reddit about Unsora AI.

A tool I built that removes Sora watermarks and upscales videos to 1080p without paying $200/month for Sora Pro. I posted it on a whim, thought I might get 2-4 sign ups from meme makers here and there.

4 days later, 1k+ likes, 400k+ views, $700 MRR, 3200+ videos processed from 16+ countries

Since then:

* $1400 MRR (mostly from indie creators and small agencies)
* One customer paid $550 for a custom plan before I even offered one

Soon, realized I'm not building a watermark or upscaler tool. I'm accidentally building bulk an AI shortform video platform.

Current features that actually get used

* Remove watermarks 
* Upscale to 1080p
* Bulk subtitles 
* Bulk processing for all features (up to 20 vids at once)

Now I'm building a bulk post scheduler, upload once, hit TikTok, YT Shorts, Instagram etc. The MVP is almost done.

I don't want to just add ""features."" I want to automate the entire shortform workflow for companies who pump out AI videos at scale.

So my question is ‘What actual automation would save you hours?’

Not the obvious stuff, I'm talking about the ""I wish someone would just automate this painful bullshit"" level of automation.

Some ideas on top of my head 

* Auto generate 5 variations of one video (different hooks, lengths, aspect ratios) for A/B testing
* AI that watches your video and auto suggests the best 3 clips to post based on engagement patterns
* Auto translate subtitles + localize content for different markets
* Or build an entire pipeline, Drop 100 Sora videos → watermark removed → upscaled → subtitled → scheduled → analytics dashboard

What am I missing?

I have 2 weeks before the next sprint and want to build something that doesn't just *look* useful, but is useful.

kept it pretty minimal on purpose because every crm i’ve used just piles features on until the whole thing feels heavy. this one is more “essentials only.”

Applying in the First Hour + DM’ing Recruiters on LinkedIn Is How You Get Interviews — I Built a Tool That Prioritizes New Roles at Top Companies,"We’re all told *“apply fast and DM recruiters on LinkedIn”* if we want interviews.

Using this method, I have received interviews with Apple, Coinbase, Paypal, SpaceX, and Anduril.

But when I did this method, I ran into a few problems:

* LinkedIn “recent” posts were often actually weeks old
* Tons of reposts and ghost jobs
* Bloated feeds full of companies I didn’t care about

So I started going straight to the source: company career pages. That worked… but manually checking every target company every day (and then hunting for recruiters on LinkedIn) quickly became a full-time job.

So I built this tool as a single place I can check daily.

**How to use it:**

* Set the time window filter to **< 24 hours**
* Check it frequently
* Use the LinkedIn links to find recruiters / hiring managers
* Apply early

It only surfaces roles from companies I actually care about and pulls directly from their job pages, so no stale or random listings.

Next up, I’d love to add notifications and AI resume-to-job matching (LLMs are way better at this than simple keyword/vector matching).

Would love any feedback or ideas for making it more useful.

All while hustling with your FRIENDS!! YES! One of the key features of the app is friendship.

**Friends Section:** This section, to me, is really interesting as it is made for users to improve with their friends by building shared rituals, sharing quotes and ideas to reflect on, and other things, so we can all improve the best way possible.

I spent months polishing it and optimizing rendering, doing everything the right way. Then I launched it, and suddenly, installs started climbing. Cool, right? Except no. People aren’t using it for the main feature at all. They found a loophole in one of the secondary tools inside the app, and they’re using it for something I never intended. It honestly feels a bit questionable. Nothing illegal, but definitely not the inspiring AI creativity vision I started with.

Now I’m stuck. Do I lean into what the market clearly wants, even if the use case feels a little off? Or do I block it and stick to the original idea, even if that means killing the sudden growth?

"I found the holy grail of early signups for my Sports Betting Player Prop Research tool, and it WASN'T Posting ads","My team and I built a really strong Player Prop research tool for sports betting. Our goal is simple, help the average-joe win more bets, not cater to ""professional betters"". We found similar apps in the space were charging $20-200/mo for a subscription, and so over built that it was hard to know what you were looking at. 

We've priced ours at just $4.99/mo.

  
Our biggest challenge was just getting in front of people. We went live in October, and I've been running ads, with decent engagement, but the ROI wasn't great.

Through some really good advise on Reddit, I was told ""be where your people are"", so yesterday I set up post notifications on twitter for some of the really big content creators, people like CodyBrownBets, and as soon as they posted their bet slips, I commented on their post with screenshots from our app showing the visual analytics based on the players they're betting on.

We were able to get 12 sign-up's yesterday, which brings us to a total of 73 as of this morning! That's a 20% growth in 1 day! We've built the app to be very UI/UX oriented, we wanted visually simple and appealing. I'll post some screen shots from yesterday's game. 

Now we just need to get better at converting from our free license to our paid option. 

We set a ""Featured Game"" every week in which the free tier users get ALL features, and prop scores for that game only, but to see the rest of the games, they need to upgrade to Pro. The thought here is to give people a taste on something like Monday Night Football, then when they go to use it for the next game on TNF, they only see the featured game, which is on Sunday, so they have to subscribe.

I keep losing my AI prompts so I built a place to save them,"These days it seems half my time is spent prompting an AI to do something. With that comes manually reprompting the same things over and over. Sometimes I save them to a notepad, but its messy and I forget about them.

Others have their own ways of solving this problem: ""Just store them in excel, github, notion...""   the list goes on...

None of these solutions seemed ideal. I went through dozens of chrome extensions that were broken, paywalled, or overcomplicated. Nothing worked for me.

So I decided to build something myself. A simple, easy place to store my prompts.

I added only the core features that matter:  
\- Prompt, title, description  
\- Tagging  
\- Versioning   
\- 1 click run prompt in ChatGPT (or platform of choice)

I'm pretty happy with the result so far. Now I can easily keep up with all my prompts in a clean workspace without feeling overwhelmed. Versioning has been especially useful.

Wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience trying to manage their prompts, and if a solution like this would be useful?

Right now I only have a demo live, but should give you a feel for the full product: [https://prompty-368379679336.us-west1.run.app/](https://prompty-368379679336.us-west1.run.app/)

"Burned out in big tech, built a mental wellness app, that I needed. Looking for beta testers.","Hey everyone! I'm building [Breathtaking](https://trybreathtaking.com/), an app that I needed when I was burned out, depressed and anxious.

A year and a half ago I had to take 6 months short term disability leave to deal with my anxiety and depression, I focused only on fixing my head. I spent the next 6 months doing therapy, reading books and trying different healing techniques. After my short term disability was over I quit my big tech job and never looked back.

Few close friends recommended that I should use my experience to help others and it made a lot of sense. Since May I have been working on Breathtaking and we're entering a beta testing period, we're looking for beta testers.

I've learned that doing daily practice exercises can have a great impact on your mental state but only if you find the practice that works for you, so I built an algorithm that skips the painstaking trial and error that took me 4 months to find the exercise that works for me.

The first 5 months of the building was mostly formulating the idea, doing alpha testing to see if it creates enough impact, research, developing the personality test, recommendation engine and generating exercises, and in the past month and a half we have been building it.

How it works, by doing a short personality test and taking input on your stress, emotional dysregulation, focus, energy and motivation it assigns between 1-3 exercises that can range from breathwork, movement, meditation or journaling, customized to help you specifically with what you need help with. You check in once a week to retake your input on the aforementioned metrics and you have an option to readjust your plan based on your current state.

If anyone's interested to be a part of a beta testing trial you can message me or leave your email on the ""Get early access"" button on my website.

I'd love to get some feedback on the idea and the website, and advice for marketing etc.

"I built a native Dynamic Island for Mac focused on performance and elegance. It unifies notifications, media, drag and drop, weather and more into one premium interface.","I created **DynamicHorizon** because existing notch utilities often feel clunky or resource-heavy. I wanted a solution that felt like it came directly from Apple: simple, lightweight, and completely optimized for macOS.

As a software engineer with a background in both QA and graphic design I crafted this app with dedication for total excellence. Before this public launch, we processed over 300 requests to join the beta and worked closely with 50 active testers to rigorously assure quality and stability.

It is built 100% in SwiftUI and AppKit, ensuring it has negligible impact on your battery or CPU. Every transition uses premium, handcrafted animations to feel indistinguishable from the system UI.

**Features:**

Use the notch as a responsive productivity hub with: *live system indicators*, *custom media controls for Spotify and Apple Music*, *compact messaging notifications, and drag-and-drop airdrop*, plus **many** additional features. DynamicHorizon also enhances your Lock Screen with *real-time weather* and a *full media player* that feels native to macOS.

**Built to Evolve:** DynamicHorizon is designed to receive substantial features over time. We are already testing productivity tools (like timers and notes) and the ability to reply to notifications directly from the notch, which are expected to be released soon.

**I** do not believe in renting utilities. DynamicHorizon is a **one-time purchase (Lifetime License)** for permanent access and all future updates.

Use the code **HORIZON20** for 20% off during this launch window.

👉 I built a real-time dashboard that shows recently updated GitHub repos (powered only by GitHub Actions + Pages),"Hi everyone! 👋

I’m always curious about what’s happening on GitHub — I like discovering new projects, seeing which repos are actively maintained, and generally keeping an eye on what’s being built out there.

Because of that curiosity, I ended up creating a small tool that I’ve actually found surprisingly useful myself.

It’s a real-time dashboard that shows the most recently updated public GitHub repositories, filtered by a minimum number of stars.

Over the past days it already helped me discover several repos I had never heard of but instantly bookmarked.

The goal was to keep the architecture extremely simple:

* GitHub Actions → runs every few minutes, calls the GitHub API, generates a cached JSON file
* GitHub Pages → serves a fully static frontend
* React + Vite → used to build the UI quickly (with Vibe Coding for some of the visual design)

The dashboard supports:

* recent updates
* owner info + avatars
* minimum star filtering
* search by name/description
* pagination
* automatic refresh (with a small notification when new data is available)

There’s no backend at all — everything runs through GitHub’s infrastructure.

🔗 Demo + source code:

You can upload photos, videos, docs, and notes — all securely stored in the cloud. Organize them into folders, **lock** the private ones, **star** the important ones, and find anything instantly with a **lightning-fast** search engine.

i used production tech like **postgres**, aws and used techniques majorly used in startups and mostly in professional environment like modular code, using **fuzzy** matchmaking in searches, managing rate limiting etc.

On the frontend, I used **Next.js**, **React Query**, and **Redux**. I optimized it with lazy loading, suspense boundaries, server & client component separation, custom hooks, debounced search, file previews, and smooth UI transitions.

The cool part is the search (actually every part is cool) — it’s smart, fast, supports suggestions, and the UI updates in real time using modern React best practices. I also added preview thumbnails for images/videos, folder organization, and clean error handling like you'd see in production apps.

I built an open-source CRM after getting frustrated with HubSpot's pricing,"Hey everyone!

After hitting HubSpot's paywall one too many times and realizing I was paying $50/month just to track 500 contacts, I decided to build my own CRM. 8 months later, [Relaticle](https://relaticle.com/) is now open-source and ready for others to use.

# The Problem

Every CRM I tried had the same issues:

* Free tiers are crippled
* Per-seat pricing kills small teams
* Your data is held hostage
* Simple customizations require enterprise plans

# The Solution

Relaticle is a fully-featured CRM you can self-host or use our free cloud version:

* **Contacts & Companies** \- Full relationship tracking
* **Sales Pipeline** \- Custom stages, forecasting
* **Tasks** \- Assignments, notifications, due dates
* **Notes** \- Link to any record
* **Custom Fields** \- Add fields without coding
* **AI Summaries** \- One-click intelligent insights
* **Team Support** \- Multi-workspace, role-based access
* **Import/Export** \- Your data is portable

# Tech Details

Built with Laravel 12, Filament 4, and PostgreSQL. The whole stack is modern, well-tested, and easy to deploy.

# What I learned

1. Building a CRM is 20% features, 80% edge cases
2. Custom fields are deceptively complex
3. Multi-tenancy bugs are the worst bugs
4. AI features are easier to add than I thought

Can you review my service....is it any good?,"Hi everyone! 👋

I’ve been working on a project to make Christmas gift-giving easier for families.

It’s a [free site](http://www.wishlist.kids/) where you can build and share a wishlist for your child

No more gift admin fielding messages from the family, ""what do they want?"". No more duplicates!

1. Collect ideas from across the web
2. Paste them to your child's list
3. Share it with family and friends when birthdays and Christmas come around.

It's also useful for managing your godchildren or nieces and nephews....and includes reminders with gift ideas.

I've had a few people sign up, but they didn't continue to add things to their wish lists. I'm trying to find out why...and how i can make it better.

**I’m looking for a few kind Mums** [to give it a go](http://www.wishlist.kids) and tell me what’s confusing, broken, or just not working.

In return, I’ll send a cuddly frog as a thank-you 🎁 (UK only for now, sorry!).

All you have to do is [set up some lists](http://www.wishlist.kids/children) and make some notes about your experience.... if you know how to take screenshots, that's a plus.

I'll share a feedback form for you to fill in. At the bottom you can include your address. That's it. I have 20 frogs to send....

I built an AI trading agnet that shows you the complete reasoning behind every trade (not just signals),"After watching countless trading bots lose money or operate as black boxes, I decided to build something different.



Most AI trading bots just give you ""buy"" or ""sell"" signals. But what happens when it makes a bad trade? You have no idea why. That's the problem I wanted to solve.



Milo works as your personal portfolio manager with full transparency:



• Shows the complete reasoning behind every trade decision

• You set all risk parameters upfront (position sizing, daily loss limits, etc.)

• Monitors 24/7 and executes via broker APIs

• Works with both stocks (via Solana/xStocks protocol) and crypto

• Logs everything so you can review what worked and what didn't



The image shows a real trade thesis from the system - detailed technical analysis, risk assessment, and the actual outcome. When AI shows its work, you stay in control.



Been working on this for months and finally feel ready to share. Would love feedback from other builders.

Launched AI home staging chat today - 1% the cost of traditional staging,"Just launched [Home Image Chat](http://www.homeimagechat.com) this morning.

**What it does:** AI home staging for real estate agents and homeowners using a chat interface. Upload empty/unfinished/zero-prep room photos, get buyer-ready staged versions in 30 seconds.

**The problem I'm solving:** Traditional staging costs $50-100 per photo. On top of that it is a pain to arrange for furniture to be delivered and moved around your home to traditionally stage it.

**The hard part:** Building validation that ensures room architecture stays consistent. AI loves to add extra windows or move walls. Spent almost all of my time on the validation framework:

* Generate → Compare → Validate → Retry with stricter constraints

**Pricing strategy:** 5 free credits to start (no credit card). Then à la carte credit purchases. Intentionally avoided subscriptions - users only pay for what they use.

**Current status:**

* Launched this morning (Dec 2)
* Zero marketing budget (bootstrapped)

Would love to get feedback on this!  The image is from my office this morning that is now properly staged :)

I added an AI agent to my competitor monitoring tool: it knows **everything** about your competitors,"r/SideProject...!

I run a competitor monitoring SaaS called ChampSignal. It tracks websites, Reddit, news, Google Ads, and SEO for your competitors and sends you alerts when something **important** changes.

The problem: users had tons of data but kept asking me ""what should I actually DO with all this?""

So I built **Champ**: an AI agent that sits on top of all the tracked data. Instead of checking dashboards, you just ask:

- ""What did [competitor] change this month?""
- ""Create a battlecard vs [competitor]""
- ""What are people saying about [competitor] on Reddit?""
- ""Give me a one-liner for why we're different""

The hard part was grounding it in real data...

Generic ChatGPT almost always hallucinates. Champ only knows what we've actually tracked: website diffs, news articles, Reddit posts, ad creatives, etc. When it answers, it's pulling from real monitored events with timestamps.

**What I'm still figuring out:**
- What to do when there isn't enough data yet
- Long-term trend analysis (""how has their pricing changed over 12 months?"") is tricky with chunking
- Not sure if people want proactive suggestions or just reactive (e.g. only chat with it)

Would love feedback from anyone who tracks competitors!!

"I got tired of 2GB Docker images for simple AI chats, so I built a single-file PHP interface.","Hi everyone,

I’ve been getting into local AI (Ollama) recently, but I was frustrated that every UI suggestion seems to require a complex stack (Node.js, React, Docker, 50 containers). I just wanted something I could drop onto my existing cheap shared hosting or a Raspberry Pi without setting up a build pipeline.

So I built **Single-File PHP AI**.

D

It’s exactly what it sounds like: One `index.php` file.

* **No Database:** Saves chat history to your browser's LocalStorage.
* **No Build:** Just `git clone` or upload the file.
* **Streaming:** Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) so the text types out in real-time (no buffering).
* **Backend:** Supports both Ollama (Local) and OpenAI (API).

I know PHP isn't the ""coolest"" language right now, but for ""drop-in and works forever"" utility, it's hard to beat.

It’s MIT licensed. I’d love to hear if this is useful to anyone else who prefers lightweight setups.

"""Body & Mind Detective"" – A Single-File, Privacy-First Student Regulation Tool. Looking for advice on Local LLM integration and lightweight data sync.","Hi r/selfhosted,

I am a teacher and developer who has been working on a solution for ""High-Functioning Burnout"" and student regulation. I wanted a way to check in with students regarding their physical readiness to learn (hunger, energy levels, overstimulation) without relying on SaaS platforms that harvest student data.

I built **Body & Mind Detective**, a Single-Page Application (SPA) designed to be self-hosted easily (it’s vanilla JS/HTML).

**Why I built it (The Self-Hosted Angle):** Most EdTech tools track everything. I wanted a tool where the data stays in the classroom. Currently, it runs entirely client-side.

**The Current Features:**

* **Student Mode:** Visual/Emoji-based interoception check (identifying physical needs).
* **Teacher Mode:** Burnout detection checklist for educators.
* **Privacy:** No ads, no tracking, zero external dependencies.

\*\* 🛠️ I need the community's advice on the Roadmap:\*\*

I am currently expanding the tool and hit two architectural roadblocks where I could use your input:

**1. The ""Super Prompt"" / Local AI Integration** I want to add a feature where the assessment data generates a detailed ""Super Prompt."" The idea is to send this prompt to an AI to get specific, up-to-date exercises for that specific stress profile.

* *The Goal:* I want to support privacy-first AI.
* *The Question:* How should I structure this for self-hosters? Should I add a settings field for a local endpoint (e.g., pointing to a local instance of Ollama/LocalAI)? Or should I just generate the prompt text for the user to copy-paste into their preferred LLM (Claude/Gemini/Local)? I want to avoid hard-coding any specific AI service.

**2. Teacher-Student Data Sync** Currently, the app is client-side only. I want the Teacher Dashboard to be able to ""see"" the results of the students in the room to make determinations on class-wide activities.

* *The Constraint:* I want to keep this lightweight (avoiding complex Docker stacks if possible).
* *The Question:* What is the best ""self-hosted friendly"" way to handle this? A lightweight SQLite backend? Or perhaps a peer-to-peer approach? I want to keep the barrier to entry low for non-technical teachers while allowing sysadmins to host it securely.

Let’s try something different: Share your side project after giving feedback to two others (<5K MRR founders especially welcome),"I’ve noticed a pattern in a lot of threads in this and other similar subs. People drop their product link, disappear, and the thread ends up feeling more like a link dump than a place to actually help each other grow.



I wanted to try a different kind of post.



If you want to share your side project here, amazing. But before you do, **please take 2 minutes to comment on at least two other projects in the thread.**



Even something small like “I love this idea”. But let's try to offer constructive feedback or genuine compliments. 



Most of us here are building alone, with <$5K MRR or $0 MRR (that's me), trying to make our own way in life, learning as we go. A little encouragement goes a long way.



**Guidelines for this thread:**

1. **Drop your product link only after leaving two comments on other posts.**
2. Keep your feedback constructive. No need to tear anyone down.
3. Be honest about your stage. If you’re pre-launch, $0 MRR, or under $5K MRR, you’re exactly who this post is for.
4. Ask for specific feedback if you want it (landing page, pricing, UX, etc.).
5. Pay it forward. Even one kind or thoughtful comment can make someone’s week.



I’ll start by commenting on the first few that come in.

"2 failed micro-SaaS this year, then I built something people actually pay for – the Stripe notification still feels unreal","Back in December 2024, I needed to integrate an API for a project, but they required a call first. Problem? My English over the phone is... rough. I had to bring a friend along just to help me communicate. As a developer, that was embarrassing.

But I realized this wasn't just my problem – it kept happening around me. Friends asking for help with international calls, colleagues struggling in cross-team meetings because they couldn't follow in real-time.

**The two failures nobody talks about**

This is actually my third micro-SaaS attempt this year. The first two? Complete disasters. Built solutions desperately searching for problems. Spent months coding features nobody asked for. Maybe 5 signups total between both projects.

Classic first-time founder mistakes.

**Then I tried something different**

In May 2025, I started working on Echo (still keeping my day job as a Business Developer). The idea: share your meeting link, an AI translator joins automatically. Real-time translation with voice cloning, under 1.5s latency.

But here's what I changed – **I didn't touch code for weeks.**

Instead, I built a simple landing page and went hard on LinkedIn. Very targeted outreach to specific roles: Head of Customer Success, CS Team Leads, BDRs, Account Executives – people who deal with international clients daily.

My process was manual but intentional:

* Send connection request
* If accepted, send a short, genuine DM
* Explain the project, ask if they face this pain point
* See if they'd join a waiting list

The responses surprised me. Even people without the problem would write back: *""Don't need this personally, but this is brilliant – here's someone who might""* or *""Not my pain point but rooting for you, keep me posted!""*

Got **25-30 companies on the waiting list** before writing a single line of code. That's when I knew this was different from the first two attempts.

**The moment that made it real**

Few weeks ago, launched V1. Currently running **about 3 demos per week** with companies. The technical challenges were wild (getting sub-1.5s latency with voice cloning isn't trivial), but that's the fun part.

Then it happened – **that first Stripe notification email.** ""You've received a payment.""

Man, that feeling. After two complete failures, someone actually paid for something I built. Then a second company signed up.

I'm not gonna pretend I've ""made it"" – two paying customers is just the start. But after months of crickets on the first two projects, this validation hits different.

**Why I think this one worked**

1. **Validated before building** – Those 25-30 warm leads gave me confidence the problem was real
2. **I'm my own target user** – French developer building for French/non-English markets struggling to go international
3. **LinkedIn DMs > cold outreach** – Personal, conversational messages to decision-makers, not spam
4. **Started with francophones** – Markets where language barriers genuinely block growth (France especially)

**Still figuring it out**

I'm not trying to revolutionize anything. Just solving a problem I actually have, that helps companies expand internationally without hiring expensive translators for every call.

If you're building something, my advice: **find 20+ people who say they'd pay before you build.** Sounds obvious, but my first two failures were because I skipped this step.

Right now, things are a bit quiet (end of year, frozen budgets, delayed decisions), but I'm learning to accept this pace. As long as it's moving forward, even slowly, I'm good with that.

Plug something in that you're already working on and see how it compares to your prior research & assumptions. Or stick something new in there and maybe get inspired.

  
It's certainly not a feature heavy app at the moment. But here are some feature ideas I have:

\- More output config options generally. (UX Flow for apps, MVP Spec, etc…)

\- Adding individual outputs to ideas that have already been generated for further validation.

\- Then I posted it on reddit, and it did good, drove almost 50 visitors and led to 3 trial conversions

\- Later one of them cancelled, one of them didn't completed onboarding as my fucking onboarding api wasn't working properly.

\- Then I fixed it and wrote an apology email and sent it to them and thankfully they came back, one even directly bought the pro plan without the trial

"""Non-designer? This tool analyses your landing page against 50+ award-winning sites""","  
Hi folks



I've built [Pirouette.Design](https://pirouette.design/) a project born from my own struggles with design.



When building my design portfolio, I knew what great UX looked like (think Stripe, Airbnb, Basecamp), but translating that knowledge into actionable improvements was the hard part. I needed clear, specific guidance – not just inspiration.



That's why I built Pirouette. It's a web app that gives non-designers confidence in their design decisions by analysing pages across 7 key areas:

**Visual Hierarchy** – Layout and element prioritisation

**Typography** – Font choices, sizes, readability

**Color & Contrast** – Accessibility and visual appeal (WCAG compliance)

**Whitespace** – Breathing room and balance

**CTA Design** – Call-to-action effectiveness

**Mobile Responsiveness** – Cross-device compatibility

**Loading Performance** – Speed and optimisation

Built a prompt builder for Google's Veo 3.1 video AI - my first full-stack side project!,"Hey everyone! Just finished my latest side project and wanted to share it here.

It's web app that helps you create and manage prompts for Google Veo 3.1 (their video generation AI). Think of it as a structured form builder specifically designed for video generation prompts.

I built it because I was playing around with Veo 3.1 and realized that writing good video prompts is WAY harder than image prompts. You need to think about camera movements, lighting setups, temporal dynamics, and a ton of other technical stuff. I kept losing track of good prompts and variations, so I built this to organize everything.

What it does:

* Real-time validation so you know if you're missing something
* Save and organize all your prompts
* Export/import as JSON for backup
* Nice glassmorphism UI (because why not? lol)

Tech:

* React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
* NestJS backend with Prisma
* PostgreSQL database
* Everything runs in Docker
* Self-hostable (just docker-compose up!)

I built a Reddit AI Agent because I was tired of Social Listening tools. 0 to 10 paying customers in 2 weeks.,"I almost abandoned this project before writing a single line of code.

I wanted to build a lead gen tool, but the market looked impossible. Between GummySearch and a dozen other ""listeners,"" I thought, ""It’s too late. The market is cooked.""

But I built Leado anyway because I had a specific itch to scratch: **The existing tools only solved half the problem.**

**The Problem:**  
Most tools just send you an alert saying ""Someone mentioned CRM."" You still have to click, read, think of a witty reply, and type it out. It’s a full-time job.

**The Project:**  
I pivoted from a ""Listener"" to an **AI Agent**.

* **Autopilot:** It runs in the background finding leads.
* **The Tech:** I focused heavily on the prompting engineering. It reads the OP + comments and drafts a reply that actually passes the ""human sniff test"" (contextual, helpful, not salesy).

**The Validation:**  
It took 14 days to get the first customer.  
Today (a few weeks later): 10 paying customers and 200+ active users.

**The Lesson for other side projects:**  
If you see a saturated market, don't run. Saturation just means there's liquidity (money changing hands). 

You don't need to invent a new category, you just need to automate the part that everyone else is doing manually.

"I built a ""GitHub-style Heatmap"" for Ebooks because I struggled to maintain a reading habit (built via vibe coding)","Hi r/SideProject,

I wanted to show you **Lumen Read**, my first serious open-source project.

**The Problem:** I have a folder full of EPUBs I swore I would read, but I never do. Reading in the browser usually feels clunky, and I lack the discipline to keep a streak going.

**The Solution:** I realized I get dopamine from seeing my GitHub contribution graph turn green. So, I decided to bring that mechanic to my books.

I took an existing open-source engine (Flow), forked it, and completely ""remastered"" the UI and logic to focus on **Gamification and Focus**.

**✨ What I added:**

* 📊 **Reading Analytics:** A dashboard that tracks reading time, speed, and builds a **Heatmap Calendar** of your activity.
* 🔥 **Streaks:** A simple counter to keep the momentum.
* 🎨 **Material Design 3:** A complete UI overhaul with dynamic theming (the whole app adapts to your chosen color).
* 🌑 **Smart Dark Mode:** Inverts text but preserves images/syntax highlights.

**🛠️ The Process (Vibe Coding):** I'm a student, not a senior dev. To pull this off, I leaned heavily on AI tools (Gemini 3 & Claude Sonnet) to help me refactor the legacy codebase and generate the new UI components. It was a massive experiment in ""Vibe Coding"" — focusing on the product vision while the AI handled the boilerplate implementation.

**Tech Stack:** React, Vite, TailwindCSS, epub.js, localForage (IndexedDB). **License:** AGPLv3 (Open Source).

**🔗 Links:**

* **GitHub (Code & Manual Install):** [GitHub Lumen Read](https://github.com/Zolangui/Lumen-Read)
* **Firefox Add-on:** [Lumen Read](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lumen-read/)

I'd love your feedback on the analytics dashboard. Is the ""estimated time to finish"" feature useful to you?

Thanks!

The ROI of consistent LinkedIn presence just got stupid-simple (Black Friday find on RocketHub),"
B2B marketer confession: I've been preaching ""thought leadership on LinkedIn"" to clients for years.

But my own posting? Inconsistent as hell.

Why? The photo problem.

Every LinkedIn post needs a visual. Stock photos look generic. Old headshots feel stale. Booking photoshoots every month? Not happening.

So I'd write great posts... and just not publish them.

Then I found Looktara on RocketHub's Black Friday sale.

What it does:

AI generates professional photos of YOU specifically (not generic people).

- Upload 30 photos once
- AI trains on your face in 10 minutes
- Type ""me in a blazer, boardroom setting"" → photo in 5 seconds
- Unlimited generation, lifetime access

The B2B marketing impact:

I've been testing this for 48 hours. Here's what changed:

Before:

- Posting 2-3× per week (when I had photos)
- Same headshot recycled repeatedly
- Posts felt impersonal/templated

After:

- Posted 6× in 2 days
- Different photo for each post (matching the message)
- Engagement up 2.4× on latest posts

Why this matters for B2B:

LinkedIn's algorithm rewards consistency AND personal visibility.

Posts with faces get 38% more engagement than text-only or stock photos.

But most B2B marketers don't post consistently because of the photo friction.

This removes that friction entirely.

Use cases I'm already implementing:

- LinkedIn thought leadership posts (different vibe per topic)
- Case study visuals (professional but approachable)
- Event promotion graphics (speaking photos, panel shots)
- Email signature headshots (keep them fresh)
- Sales enablement materials

The Black Friday deal:

Live on RocketHub: 

<https://www.rockethub.com/deal/looktara>

Lifetime access for less than ONE professional photoshoot.

For B2B marketers who know they should post more but keep hitting the ""I don't have a photo"" wall... this just eliminated that excuse.

Not affiliated. Just sharing because this solved a real bottleneck in my content ops.

"FOR MUSIC LOVERS - Made a free extension that adds a Volume Booster, 3D spatial audio and EQ to any website making audio sound however you want it to sound - Love to hear honest opinions","As a music producer and someone who spends hours listening to music and podcasts on my computer, I got tired of the flat audio experience. So I built a free extension that adds professional industry standard audio processing to Chrome.

What it does:

**Volume Booster** \- Up to 500% volume boost to make your computer sound as loud as a sound system

**10-band EQ** \- Fine-tune frequencies from 32Hz to 16kHz so if you need more bass or more high end you're covered

**3D Spatial Audio** \- Simulates different room acoustics to give you that full 3D immersive feel. You can make the audio sound as if you're at a concert hall, movie cinema or cathedral, whilst just laying cosy in your bedroom. 

**AI Enhancement** \- Add Noise reduction and clarity boost to any videos you watch

**Custom Presets** \- Save your settings per website (Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, etc.)

The spatial audio uses impulse responses to simulate real acoustic spaces. You can adjust room size, spatial width to optimize for a music concert/podcast/movie experience.

It took me several months to perfect the 3D audio sound. I've been using it for months myself and decided to give back and the best part? It's **completely free** require no email setup, no personal information and works on **any chrome website.**

Try it and let me know what you think in the comments!

Whats the catch? None just if you like it please leave a rating or review as that helps google recommend this more to people, that's all :)

ChartOne: Generate chart images with 20+ preset themes (no design needed),"Hey r/SideProject,

Just launched ChartOne after months of side project work. It's a chart image API for emails and reports, but here's the twist: instead of making you configure colors and fonts, I built 20+ preset palettes that just work.

**The problem I was solving:**

I run statscalculators.com and noticed users download charts constantly. The options for generating good-looking charts programmatically are all frustrating:

* Excel charts look terrible out of the box (that default blue is painful)
* R and Python libraries require coding skills and still need manual styling
* Design tools mean exporting data, tweaking colors for 20 minutes, exporting as PNG, uploading to CDN, then embedding

Most chart APIs give you infinite customization, which sounds great until you're staring at 100+ configuration parameters trying to pick 8 colors that harmonize and fonts that don't clash. I just wanted to type `palette=economist` and be done.

**What I built:**

20+ professionally designed palettes. Some examples:

* Financial (Bloomberg terminal style with dark background)
* Economist (data journalism with serif fonts)
* Neon (cyberpunk hot pink and cyan)
* FiveThirtyEight (inspired by 538's iconic style)
* High Contrast (WCAG AAA compliant for accessibility)
* Plus corporate, scientific, pastel, retro, and more

You can also import your own palettes directly from Coolors or Adobe Color if you have specific brand colors.

**How it works:**

Non-devs can use the chart builder (load your data, pick palette, get URL). Devs can hit the API with their data and `palette=economist` parameter, get back an image URL that works in emails, Slack, Notion, anywhere HTML works.

Built with Fastify and ECharts, using skia-canvas for rendering (10x faster than Puppeteer). Free tier is 2,000 charts/month with no watermark.

**Where I'm at:**

Just launched and looking for early users to test it. Still working my full-time job during the day and built this nights and weekends.

**What I learned:**

Software architecture was the hardest part for me since I'm not an engineer. I also should have gotten users earlier instead of building in isolation for months. Classic mistake, so here I am now.

**Looking for feedback:**

Would love to hear if this solves a real problem for anyone. Is the free tier useful? What would make you actually use this?

Try it at [chartone.dev/chart-builder](http://chartone.dev/chart-builder) if you're curious. You can see all the palettes at [chartone.dev/palettes](http://chartone.dev/palettes).

tried the gpt-5 supervisor workflow but switched it up with chinese models. actually works better for my budget,"Saw that post about using gpt-5 high as supervisor and claude/codex as code monkey. tried it for like 2 weeks, workflow is solid but bills were insane. $100 claude subscription plus gpt-5 api costs adds up fast.

started experimenting with chinese models cause i needed cheaper options that dont completly suck.

what i tested:

kimi k2 - solid but slow, kept hitting rate limits
 deepseek - cheap but crashes on complex tasks, wasted time debuging
 minimax - decent middle ground nothing special
 glm-4.6 - surprised me honestly

the workflow i landed on:

still use gpt-5 for architectural planning and epic creation cause its genuinly the smartest for that stuff. no argument there.

but for actual coding phases switched to glm-4.6 instead of claude or codex.

heres why it worked:

first try accuracy - glm gets instructions right way more often than i expected. when gpt-5 gives it a phase prompt it actually follows it without needing 3 iterations of ""no thats not what i meant""

token efficiency - uses like 30-40% less tokens than other models for same tasks. means my api bills droped from $150/month to like $40

speed is fine - not blazing fast but not painfully slow either, good enough for iterating without wanting to quit

handles complexity - gave it a 6 file change (api endpoint, service layer, db model, tests, types) and it tracked dependancies correctly. deepseek completly failed at this started making stuff up halfway through

where it still needs supervision:

anything involving race conditions or distributed systems still needs gpt-5 review. its not magic.

business logic edge cases sometimes misses them.

performance optimization decent but not great.

but heres the thing - those boring phases? glm just does them. missing null checks regex fixes adding validation refactoring duplicated code. the stuff you dont wanna touch but needs doing.

my current setup:

tab 1: gpt-5 for planning architecture code review
 tab 2: glm-4.6 for coding phases
 tab 3: terminal for testing

gpt-5 creates epic and phases. gives prompt to glm for phase 1. glm codes it. i test it myself cause i dont trust any ai blindly. if it works move to phase 2. if theres issues gpt-5 reviews and tells glm what to fix.

cost comparison over last month:

old setup (gpt-5 + claude): ~$250
 new setup (gpt-5 + glm): ~$85

quality drop? honestly minimal for the type of work im doing. maybe 5% more manual fixes but the cost savings are real.

is it perfect? nah. but if your doing vibe-coding on a budget and still want that supervisor/code monkey workflow chinese models like glm are worth testing.

kimi was too slow and expensive for my usecase. deepseek kept breaking. minimax was meh. glm hit the sweet spot of cheap reliable and actualy follows instructions.

anyone else tried mixing western models for planning with chinese models for execution? curious if others found similar results or if i just got lucky",Altruistic-March8551,1pc953p,SideProject,02-12-2025,13:59:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pc953p/tried_the_gpt5_supervisor_workflow_but_switched/
Need honest advice on pricing my AI fitness/mindset app,"Hey everyone,
I’ve been building a small side project over the last few months — an AI-powered fitness/mindset app called FitMind. It’s basically a mix of a personal trainer, habit coach, and mindset journal, all built around the OpenAI API.

I’m finally getting close to launching it, but now that I’m adding subscriptions… I realized I have no idea what the “right” price should be.

The tricky part is that the app actually costs me money per user, since every message goes through the OpenAI API. I originally planned to charge £9.99/month, but once I calculated Apple’s cut + the API usage, it barely leaves any profit. And if I ever want to run paid ads, it’s basically impossible at that price.

I’ve seen similar apps charging anywhere from £15 to £25/month, and some even push yearly plans like £59.99. But I also don’t want to scare people off because I’m still new and the app isn’t a big brand.

For anyone who’s built a subscription product or anything using AI — how did you decide on your pricing?
Is £14.99/month reasonable? Too much? Too little?
Did any of you start low and raise it later, or start high and adjust ?

Any honest advice would really help. I don’t want to overthink it but I also don’t want to shoot myself in the foot on day one. Thanks!",jelskon,1pc9389,SideProject,02-12-2025,13:57:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pc9389/need_honest_advice_on_pricing_my_ai/
"Stop Building ""AI-Powered"" Sh*t. The SaaS Gold Rush is a Trap.","""Check out my SaaS directory list"" - **nobody cares**

""I Hit 10k MRR in 30 Days: Here's How"" - **stop lying**

""I created an AI-powered chatbot"" - **no, you wrapped OpenAI's API**

""Built my MVP in 48 hours with Cursor"" - **congrats, so did 50,000 other people this week**

Most projects we see here are **totally useless** and won't exist for more than a few months. Actually, scratch that and most will be abandoned in 3 weeks when the founder realizes nobody wants to pay for their ""revolutionary"" todo app with AI.

# And the culprit is you.

Yes, **you**, who thought you'd get rich by:

* Watching a 47-minute YouTube video titled ""I Built a $10k/month SaaS with AI (You Can Too!)""
* Spending 6 hours ""coding"" in Cursor (you mean prompting)
* Slapping together NextJS + Supabase + PostgreSQL + Vercel
* Adding ""AI-Powered"" to your landing page (it's literally just a ChatGPT wrapper)
* Posting on 47 Reddit communities asking for ""feedback"" (begging for users)
* Getting 3 signups (your mom, your best friend, and a bot)
* Wondering why you're not a millionaire yet

Just because AI tools like Cursor, v0, and ChatGPT can help you code faster **doesn't mean every AI-generated SaaS needs to exist.**

# We've seen this movie before.

Remember when everyone was:

* **Launching crypto tokens** → ""This will revolutionize payments!"" (Rugpulled in 6 months)
* **Minting NFTs** → ""Digital art is the future!"" (Floor price: $0)
* **Dropshipping fidget spinners** → ""Passive source of income!"" (Banned by Shopify)
* **Creating courses** → ""Share your expertise!"" (12 sales, all refunded)
* **Starting agencies** → ""I'll manage your social media!"" (Client ghosted after 2 weeks)

And now: **Building AI SaaS** → ""Cursor will make me rich!"" (0 MRR after 4 months)

**Different costumes, same empty promises.**

# The harsh truth nobody tells you:

# 1. Your SaaS isn't special.

There are **47,000+ SaaS products** launched every year. Most die within 12 months.

Why? Because you didn't solve a problem but you created a solution looking for a problem.

Nobody wakes up thinking: *""Man, I really wish there was an AI-powered calendar that summarizes my meetings and sends me a haiku about my productivity.""*

# 2. ""AI-Powered"" means nothing anymore.

Every SaaS now has ""AI"" slapped on it:

* AI project management (it's Trello with GPT)
* AI email assistant (Gmail + OpenAI API)
* AI note-taking (Notion clone with embeddings)
* AI analytics (charts + ChatGPT summaries)

Customers don't care about AI. They care about **solving their problem faster, cheaper, or better.**

If your only differentiator is ""we added AI,"" you have no differentiator.

# 3. Tech stack doesn't matter (yet you obsess over it).

You spend 40 hours debating:

* ""Should I use NextJS or Remix?""
* ""Supabase or Firebase?""
* ""TailwindCSS or Chakra UI?""
* ""Vercel or Netlify?""

**Nobody gives a shit.**

Your customers don't care if you built it in NextJS, PHP, or hand-coded assembly. They care if it solves their problem.

Dropbox's MVP was a **video**. Airbnb's MVP was **Craigslist + a camera**. Stripe's first version **couldn't even handle edge cases**.

Stop optimizing your tech stack. Start talking to customers.

# 4. You're not a founder. You're a code monkey with delusions.

Real founders:

* Spend 80% of time talking to customers
* Understand sales, marketing, distribution
* Obsess over problem-solution fit
* Build in public and iterate based on feedback
* Know their numbers (CAC, LTV, churn, MRR)

Fake founders:

* Spend 80% of time ""perfecting"" the product
* Think ""if I build it, they will come""
* Launch on Product Hunt and wonder why nobody cares
* Have zero customers but ""plan to monetize later""
* Refuse to do sales because ""I'm technical, not a salesperson""

**If you can't sell, you can't build a business.** Period.

# 5. The only people making money are selling you the dream.

That YouTuber with ""How I Built a $50k/month SaaS""?

* Their SaaS makes $2k/month
* Their course about building SaaS makes $48k/month

That ""indie hacker"" with a Twitter following?

* Their product makes $5k/month
* Their paid community/newsletter makes $30k/month

That ""AI automation agency"" guy?

* His agency has 2 clients
* His ""agency blueprint"" course has 847 students at $297 each

**They're not experts. They're salespeople.** And they're good at one thing: making you believe you're just one AI prompt, one tech stack, one ""secret framework"" away from financial freedom.

You're not.

# What we actually need to do (the uncomfortable truth):

# 1. Stop building. Start validating.

Before you write a single line of code:

* Talk to 50 potential customers
* Ask: ""What's your biggest pain point with \[X\]?""
* Ask: ""How do you currently solve this?""
* Ask: ""Would you pay $\[price\] to solve this?""
* If 30+ say ""yes,"" you might have something

If you can't find 50 people to talk to, **you don't understand your market.**

# 2. Solve problems you've personally experienced.

The best SaaS founders build solutions to their own problems:

* Notion → Frustrated with clunky wikis
* Superhuman → Email was too slow
* Linear → Jira was a nightmare
* Figma → Design tools were desktop-only

What problem are **you** so frustrated with that you'd build a solution even if nobody paid you?

If your answer is ""I saw a gap in the market,"" you're already wrong.

# 3. Build expertise, not MVPs.

Stop launching half-baked products every month. Start building **deep expertise** in one domain.

Spend 6-12 months:

* Learning everything about a specific industry
* Talking to practitioners daily
* Understanding workflows, pain points, budgets
* Building a reputation as someone who ""gets it""

**Then** build a solution.

# 4. Learn sales first, code second.

Controversial take: **You don't need to code to build a SaaS.**

You need to:

* Identify a painful problem
* Sell the solution before it exists
* Hire developers to build it
* Sell more, iterate, scale

If you're ""technical"" but can't sell, you're not a founder then you're an engineer looking for a co-founder who'll do the hard part.

Learn sales. Learn copywriting. Learn positioning. **Then** worry about your tech stack.

# 5. Build for purpose, not profit (initially).

If your only goal is ""making money,"" you'll quit the moment it gets hard.

The best founders are **obsessed** with the problem:

* They'd work on it even without pay
* They can talk about it for hours
* They have strong opinions about the industry
* They've been thinking about this for years

If you're just chasing ""passive money,"" go buy index funds.

# Take a breath and ask yourself:

✅ **What am I genuinely world-class at?** (Not ""pretty good""—world-class)

✅ **What problems do I understand better than 99% of people?**

✅ **What could I talk about for 3 hours without notes?**

✅ **What industry do I have insider knowledge about?**

✅ **What would I build even if I knew it would never making money?**

If you can't answer these, **you're not ready to build a SaaS.** You're ready to learn, research, and gain experience.

# Let's stop the madness.

Stop building:

* Another AI chatbot
* Another project management tool ""with AI""
* Another no-code directory
* Another ""Notion alternative""
* Another Chrome extension that ""boosts productivity""

Start building:

* Deep expertise in a specific domain
* Relationships with potential customers
* Sales and marketing skills
* Financial literacy (understand unit economics)
* Resilience (because 99% of startups fail)

# The brutal reality check:

🔴 **95% of SaaS products fail**  
🔴 **Only 1% reach $1M ARR**  
🔴 **40% of startups fail due to no market need**  
🔴 **Average time to profitability: 3-5 years** (not 30 days)  
🔴 **Most ""successful"" indie hackers have 5+ failed products behind them**

Still want to build a SaaS? Good.

But do it for the right reasons:

* Because you're obsessed with solving a specific problem
* Because you have unique insights others don't
* Because you're willing to spend years learning and iterating
* Because you understand that coding is 10% of the work

**Not** because some YouTuber said you could get rich quick with Cursor and NextJS.

# Final thoughts:

I'm not saying don't use AI tools. I'm not saying don't build products.

I'm saying: **Stop building thoughtless garbage that adds zero value to the world.**

If your elevator pitch is ""It's like \[successful product\] but with AI,"" you don't have a business. You have a copycat with a ChatGPT API key.

If you can't explain why your product needs to exist in one sentence without mentioning ""AI,"" ""ML,"" or ""automation,"" you haven't found product-market fit.

And if your go-to-market strategy is ""post on Reddit and hope,"" you're not serious about building a business.

**Build less. Think more. Sell first. Code last.**

That's the formula. Everything else is noise.

**TL;DR:**

* Stop building AI-powered clones with Cursor
* Tech stack doesn't matter if you have no customers
* The only people making money are selling courses
* Learn sales before you learn to code
* Solve problems you deeply understand
* Build expertise, not MVPs
* 95% of SaaS products fail so don't be a statistic

Now go delete your ""revolutionary AI SaaS"" and start talking to real humans about real problems.

Or don't. Your choice. Just don't complain when your ""10k MRR in 30 days"" turns into ""$0 MRR after 6 months.""",Healthy_Reply_7007,1pc9342,SideProject,02-12-2025,13:56:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pc9342/stop_building_aipowered_sht_the_saas_gold_rush_is/

I built an iOS app that turns doomscrolling into learning!!!,"Hey everyone!

I’ve been building this iOS app called **BrainScroller** — it takes the same *swipe mechanic* we all use for doomscrolling, but replaces it with **short, high-signal learning cards** (philosophy, science, history, psychology, etc).

I built it because I caught myself mindlessly scrolling every night, and I wanted something that actually made me smarter instead of anxious.

A few things I’d really love feedback on:

* Does the swipe/feed UX feel smooth?
* Are the categories interesting or should I add more?
* Is the premium offering clear or confusing?
* Any features you think would make this “stickier”?

I’m a solo founder building this in React Native, with Supabase + RevenueCat on the backend — so if you see anything rough, I can fix it fast.

If you try it out, I’d love to hear what you think (good or bad).  
Thanks!

I built a weird little chess site because modern accuracy culture feels soulless.,"Hi everyone — this is a small passion project I've been working on for a while.

I love chess, but lately I’ve felt the culture drifting toward something very engine-driven and… sterile.  
Everything is “0.00”.  
Everything is “the only move”.  
Everything is prep, lines, accuracy, spreadsheets.

Meanwhile the part of chess I actually enjoy — the chaos, the intuition, the aesthetic violence of the middlegame — feels like it’s disappearing.

So I built a tiny website as a kind of creative protest:

# UziChess — a philosophical, chaotic, slightly unhinged love letter to chess.

It’s NOT a platform (yet).  
It’s NOT a competitor to anything.  
It’s more like a *manifesto* that turned into a design experiment.

It has:

* a certain “burn the 0.00 bar” attitude
* a dramatic tone that definitely takes itself too seriously
* humor
* fake GM quotes
* and a roadmap for tools I’d love to build in the future (a chaos-focused board, an aesthetic PGN viewer, a beauty-based eval score, etc.)

It’s early, but building it has been really fun — and honestly kind of therapeutic.

If anyone here is also trying to make a strange, niche, overly passionate side project:  
I hope this gives you a little spark to keep going.

Happy to hear any thoughts. 🔥

"I built a privacy-first cycle tracker for my partner because we didn't trust mobile apps 
with her data. It's now a real product.","Hey, r/SideProject! 

For the last few months, I've been working on a project that started from a personal need. My partner and I wanted a simple way to track her cycle to help us plan our lives together— trips, events, even just being more emotionally aware. 

We looked at the popular mobile apps (Flo, Clue, etc. ), but the more we read their privacy policies, the more uncomfortable we got. They all wanted to sync deeply personal health data to the cloud, and in a world of data breaches and ad tracking, that felt like a huge risk. 

We didn't want a data service; we wanted a tool. Something that lived on our own computer was 100% private and just did the job without any creepy background stuff. 

Since I couldn't find what we were looking for, I decided to build it myself. I'm a developer, and I believe software should respect its users. 

The result is **CycleCore**. 

It's a desktop-first app with two versions: 

• **CycleTracker Pro:** The version I built for myself. It lets me track up to 10 profiles (for my partner, family members, etc.) and gives me a simple, at-a-glance view of upcoming cycles, fertile windows, and ovulation. It's about being a more supportive and aware partner.

 • **Cycle Harmony:** The version for personal use. It's a clean, private way for women to track their own cycles without their data ever leaving their device.

**The Tech:** 

• It's built in Python with a simple Tkinter interface (keeping it lightweight and cross-platform). • All data is stored in local, human-readable files. You can back it up, move it, or delete it just by copying a folder. 

• There are **no accounts, no cloud sync, and no servers**. It's 100% offline. 

I just launched it on Gumroad and would love to get your feedback. The landing page has the full story and a more detailed breakdown. 

To celebrate the launch, the first 100 customers can get it for **$19.99**. After that, the price increases to **$29.99**. It's a one-time purchase for a lifetime v1.x license. 

This has been a passion project born from a real need, and I'm excited (and nervous!) to finally share it with the world. 

Let me know what you think!

I built a site for reviewing college courses - would love opinions,"I’ve been working on a little project over the last few weeks, it's basically a platform where students can review their *c*ourses.

Some people have compared it to RateMyProf, but it’s really not the same thing. RMP mostly focuses on teaching style or personality, but this is more about the *class* itself, things like workload, difficulty, exam style, assignments, whether it’s writing-heavy, group-project hell, actually useful, etc.

I always felt like picking classes was a complete shot in the dark, so I wanted to fix that. Right now, I’m testing it in Buffalo, but the idea is that any student can drop quick reviews to help the next wave.

Curious if other students at different schools would actually use something like this, or if I’m just solving my own problem lol.

weekly update - I am an idiot !,"I kept refreshing my database table and getting upset because I thought I had not gotten any new users since last week. I assumed the hype was over, everyone who wanted to try the product had already tried it, and there was nothing more to expect. Today I accidentally clicked on the next page and found a bunch of new users. I was looking at the records incorrectly and assumed the number shown was the total. It was only the total records on the current page, and it had been fixed for a week. Anyway.

I also took a detour and built a tool for prompting. I was wasting too much time copying and pasting rules, prompts, and context. Even though everything was already in my notes, it was still too much friction. With the new tool there is still some copying and pasting, but it is far less than before. If anyone is interested, I can make it public.

On the development side, I discovered too many issues with the Google Sheets integration. To make it a seamless experience, I would need a Google audit, which would take time and push the deadline further. So I created a workaround using non sensitive scopes, but it requires users to do some upfront work. At least it is better than waiting a month for the audit to pass.

I will be releasing it this week and also making some UI improvements because it could definitely be more polished. Unfortunately, that means marketing will take a back seat this week.

Total users of Easyanalytica are now at 60. The pace is slow, but it is better to make major changes while the user base is small. It would be harder to adjust things if the product had a larger audience. Active users are only 2, but that is because I changed the active user metric to returning users who create or update dashboards.

That is all from my side. Stay tuned for next week’s update.",pdycnbl,1pc89wk,SideProject,02-12-2025,13:21:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pc89wk/weekly_update_i_am_an_idiot/

[iOS][1-month Free for 48h] we built an IBS app because I have IBS… now we really need your help,"hi everyone. i’m the co-founder with ibs. the app started because my gut was destroying my life. i’m the one who

•⁠  ⁠sits on the toilet till my legs go numb

•⁠  ⁠cancels plans out of fear

•⁠  ⁠lies on the bathroom floor on bad days

•⁠  ⁠overthinks every meal and still gets it wrong

for years i felt stuck, angry, exhausted and honestly defeated.

so we built oh my gut for me first. it’s an iphone app that checks how safe a food might be based on ingredients, triggers, and your own patterns. it’s not a doctor, but it became the thing that finally gave me some control back.

👉 [https://apps.apple.com/app/id6749310645](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6749310645)

a few days ago i posted here. people tried it and gave real feedback. we fixed a lot fast.

privacy was the biggest concern. apple’s screen makes it look like we track everything. we don’t. the only reason it appears that way is an optional cloud backup feature (off by default). your health data stays on your phone, encrypted. we can’t see it.

auto-save was the second issue. it saved entries too fast and sometimes wrong. we removed it. now you decide when to save.

we also updated poop tracking to the real bristol scale, fixed bugs, and improved scoring.

here’s where i need help: apps with no ratings basically don’t exist on the app store. i know this app can help people like me, but without ratings it won’t reach anyone.

for the next 48 hours, the first 1000 installs get 1 month free. during onboarding you’ll see the paywall — tap “redeem code” and enter:

SHARETHELOVEOFGUT

if the app helps you, please leave a 5 star rating. it genuinely makes or breaks small projects like this.

and if something feels off, tell me. i’m fixing things constantly.

it’s just me with ibs and my friend who loves gut science. no investors. no team. i need this to work because i genuinely depend on it.

I analysed 10 Instagram posts to understand why some businesses go viral,"I was curious why some small businesses on Instagram randomly blow up while others barely get any reach, even when the content is similar.  
So I analysed 10 posts from small brands that recently went semi-viral.

Here’s the one thing almost everyone ignores:

# People don’t share information — they share emotion.

The posts that went viral weren’t the most “professional.”  
They were the most emotion-based.

Here’s what I found:

1. The viral posts made people *feel* something.  
A bakery shared a story behind a cake.  
A stationery brand posted a relatable “comfort desk setup.”  
A thrift store shared a funny before/after.

Not fancy. Just emotional.

2. The first 2 seconds mattered the most.  
Every viral video started with something instantly eye-catching:

* A colour
* A product close-up
* A relatable line
* A quick transformation

3. Clear visuals beat high quality**.**  
Surprisingly, the posts that went viral weren’t the most high-quality.  
They were the clearest — clean background, good lighting, no distractions.

I’m realising that going viral isn’t about looking “professional.”  
It’s about making people *feel something* and letting your personality show.

I just launched my Sudoku app - iOS only,"Hey everyone!

So I finally launched my Sudoku app: **Sudoku: Daily Brain Workout**.

The funny thing is, when I started creating this project, I had basically never solved a Sudoku puzzle before. I've tried maybe two or three times, but gave up really fast. I didn't create this because I am some kind of Sudoku expert, but for myself to learn.

Building it helped me to understand how Sudoku really works, and why certain techniques actually matter, and how people can solve tougher puzzles. And along the way, I went from “I have no idea what I’m doing” to “okay wow… this is actually really fun”.

So after hundreds of coffee cups, months and months of coding, tweaking, breaking things, fixing things, the app is finally live:

A short description of the app:

* **Daily Sudoku puzzles**, a new board every day - with leaderboard for all who beat the daily puzzle.
* Multiple modes: **Classic**, **Zen**, and **Hardcore.**
* Three different difficulty levels.
* **Explainable technique hints** that actually tells you why a specific technique works (Naked Single, Hidden Single, Naked Pair, Hidden Pair, Pointing Pairs, Box-Line Reductions, X-Wing, etc.)
* **Note mode**, auto-cleaning notes, mistake tracking, undo/redo
* Stats, streaks, and a modern, clean UI

There are still things I am going to add, more solving techniques and different modes. But I’m really excited (and honestly very nervous) to finally share it with actual real Sudoku players, instead of just my own debugging brain.

If anybody here downloads and tries the app, I would love all type of feedback, both good and bad.

I built a tool to simulate your financial future and track your progress to FIRE,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been into FIRE (Financial Independence) for a while, but I kept running into a wall.

I have apps that tell me I spent too much on coffee or subscriptions last month. That’s fine, but it doesn't help me answer the questions that actually keep me up at night.

I wanted to actually simulate my path to FIRE. I needed to visualize how my net worth would evolve over the next 10-20 years, factoring in market variance and my own life choices.

I couldn't find a tool that handled this well without demanding my bank passwords, so I built Asset Prism.

It’s a native iOS app that focuses on projection and simulation rather than just tracking expenses.

The main focus is building a realistic model of your future wealth.

To do that accurately, you can't just assume a straight line of savings until you're 40. Real life is messy. So I built a system where you can plug in ""Life Events"" to see how they reshape your curve.

For example:

- “How does buying a new car now impact my net worth in 2030?”
    
- “Can I afford a gap year without derailing my plan?”
    
- “What happens to my FIRE date if I switch to a lower-paying startup job?”
    

You add these variables, and the app runs the math locally (Monte Carlo simulations) to show you if you're still safe.

How it works:

1. Set a Goal: Define your FIRE number and target date.
    
2. Simulate: Add your assets and layer on future Life Events.
    
3. Check-in: Occasionally update your current balance to see if you are ""on track"" with the simulation.
    

No cloud, no accounts, no selling data. Just a tool to help you make decisions.

I’m polishing up the MVP for TestFlight right now.

I’m curious:  
When you think about your financial goals, do you plan for specific big purchases/events, or do you just try to save a flat % every month?

I turned my n8n workflow into a functional Micro-SaaS using Gemini 3 to write the frontend,"I love n8n for automation, but let's be honest: showing a canvas full of nodes to a non-technical client (like an accountant) is a recipe for disaster. They don't want to see the logic; they just want the result.

I wanted to see if I could turn an internal tool into a user-friendly **Micro-SaaS product**.

So, I built **Smart Invoice Manager**. It wraps a complex OCR Invoice Agent into a clean UI where users just upload a receipt, and the system handles the rest.

**The AI Assist (Gemini 3):** I'm comfortable with logic, but building a full frontend from scratch takes time. I used the new **Gemini 3** to handle the heavy lifting of the code generation, specifically connecting the UI to the n8n webhooks. It made the integration feel almost effortless compared to doing it manually.

**The ""SaaS"" Architecture (The Tricky Part):** To make this a real product (and not just a script running locally), I had to solve **Multi-Tenancy**.

If I used standard n8n Google Nodes, everything would save to *my* Drive.

* **The Fix:** I used raw HTTP Request nodes in n8n.
* **The Logic:** The frontend (via Firebase Auth) passes the user's specific Auth Token to the workflow. The automation then runs in the context of *their* account.

**The Stack:**

* **Backend:** n8n (Business Logic & OCR)
* **Frontend:** Custom UI (Antigravity)
* **AI Co-pilot:** Gemini 3 (Code gen)
* **Auth:** Firebase

It’s still an MVP, and turning it into a full-scale product would take more effort, but it proves that with the current state of AI models, the barrier between ""Automation Engineer"" and ""SaaS Founder"" is getting much smaller.

I've built a platform that redefine how automation workflows are shipped & maintained,"For the last 6+ months I’ve been building Nexroo, an automation platform focused on solving what I call the “last mile problem” of automation.

Most automation tools make it easy to build workflows (Zapier, n8n, etc.), but much harder to deliver them as something your users or clients can actually use. In real life, that “last kilometer” often turns into custom UIs, micro-SaaS wrappers, deployments, versioning, and lots of glue code.

I tried to fix that.

Nexroo AI is an automation platform. Automate everything, deploy anywhere, user-friendly rendered workflows maintain remotely

"I got tired of unmaintainable drag-and-drop automation, so I built a YAML-first engine","Hey everyone,

I've been working in Product and Engineering for a while, and I have a love/hate relationship with automation tools.

My issue with tools like Zapier or Make is that they are ""black boxes."" You can't version control a visual canvas, you can't git diff changes, and testing complex logic is a nightmare.

On the flip side, writing custom Python scripts and microservices, I have to manage the infrastructure, security, and logs myself.

So I built ETLR.

It’s a workflow automation platform designed for people who prefer code over GUIs. Instead of dragging boxes around, you define your workflows in YAML.

The Core Concept:

* Config as Code: You write the logic in YAML. This means you can version control it, peer review it, and revert it just like any other code.
* Managed Execution: You don't need to provision servers. I handle the execution layer so you just focus on the logic.
* CI/CD Friendly: Because it's text-based, you can easily deploy multiple versions or run tests against your configurations.

The Tech Stack:

* Frontend: React
* Backend/Data: Supabase
* Orchestration: Kubernetes (handles the scaling and execution of the YAML workflows)

I’ve just launched the MVP. Since this is built for a technical crowd, I’m really curious if the YAML syntax feels intuitive to you or if it needs simplification.

"After months of building alone, I finally shipped my app and I need to tell someone","There's this strange loneliness in building something solo. No teammates to celebrate the small wins with, no one to reassure you when imposter syndrome hits at 2am, no one who truly understands why you spent a week obsessing over a single interaction. You swing between ""this is the best thing I've ever made"" and ""who am I kidding"" sometimes within the same hour. But you keep going anyway, because something in you needs to see it through.

I built Jublu, an Android app blocker that actually talks to you like a human instead of just screaming ""BLOCKED."" It starts gentle (""Hey, you blocked this to focus. you've got this"") and gets more real with you the more you try to open that app (""This is attempt 15 today. What are you really looking for?"").

Shipping it was terrifying. But seeing it exist in the world, something I made with my own hands during early mornings and late nights? That feeling is impossible to describe.

"I was tired of clicking through complex cloud dashboards, so I built an AI-native platform that is just a Terminal.","Hi everyone,

I'm a backend engineer and a CLI purist. I've always felt that modern cloud development platforms have become too bloated with complex GUIs. I just want to write code, not navigate through endless menus to set up a database or configure auth.

So, I built **Fulling** (https://github.com/FullAgent/fulling).

**The idea is simple:** Terminal is all you need.

https://preview.redd.it/7ijixoqpas4g1.png?width=2998&format=png&auto=webp&s=401e3ea6239d4f70258f51db90c4a2645c0b3988

It's a browser-based development environment that feels like a local terminal but runs on a production-grade Kubernetes cluster (powered by Sealos).

https://preview.redd.it/4zkl0ynuas4g1.png?width=2974&format=png&auto=webp&s=14b8b7e5db13f842619aea359ba6fa737724f358

**What makes it different?**

* **Zero Context Switching:** You get a persistent workspace.
* **AI-Native Workflow:** It has LLMs (like Claude) integrated directly into the workflow. You can ask the AI to scaffold a Next.js app, and it actually writes the files to your directory instantly.
* **The ""Golden Stack"" Pre-wired:** It comes ready with Next.js, PostgreSQL, and shadcn/ui. No spending 2 hours on `npm install` and connection strings.
* **Instant Ship:** What you code in the terminal is instantly live on a public URL.

**Under the hood:** It runs on a Kubernetes cluster (Sealos) where each user gets a dedicated, stateful sandbox. It's not just a playground; it's capable of hosting real apps.

**I’m looking for honest feedback:** Is this *too* minimal? Does the terminal-only approach scare you off, or is this exactly what you've been looking for?

I'd love for you guys to try it out and roast my design.

"I built a STEM robot for kids, but AI kept misspelling the diagrams. So I added a ""Text Master"" model to my own tool","https://preview.redd.it/m4m1w2k56s4g1.png?width=2816&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e627d468c78ccb0a6e3ddea7c385e7b17301030

**The Context:** I'm an embedded software engineer by day. Recently, I've been working on a Raspberry Pi + Lego WeDo 2.0 robot project to teach STEM concepts to kids.

**The Problem:** To make it engaging for the kids, I wanted to create comic-style infographics explaining how the robot works (e.g., ""This is the brain,"" ""This is the motor"").

I tried using standard models like GPT-4o for image generation, but they often struggled with the text inside the images—turning labels like ""Raspberry Pi"" into alien gibberish.

**The Solution:** Since I already run a small AI image wrapper site (**gptimage.app**), I decided to integrate a model specifically optimized for text rendering.

I tested a few options (we support GPT-4o, Nano Banana, etc.), but I finally added **""Nano Banana Pro""** (tagged as *Text Master* on the site) which is based on the new Flux architecture.

**The Result (Image attached):** It finally got ""RASPBERRY PI"" and ""WEDO 2.0"" right in one shot, with a clean comic style that the kids actually like.

**You can try it here:** gptimage. app *Select the* ***""Nano Banana Pro""*** *model for the best text results.*

✳️ help me to validate/feedback the idea — StackBindr,"✳️ so here’s the vibe; ~~—~~ **StackBindr** (*yeah i just needed a name and this one randomly felt cool enough to ship with*)

You know how everyone can spin up a beautiful frontend with tools like—framer, webflow, or whatever shiny no-code tool they love?

But Then Reality Hits. **“BRO… HOW DO I CONNECT THIS TO MY ACTUAL CODED BACKEND?”**

Suddenly the vibe dies. The dream dies. 💔 You’re back to writing in MERN stack, APIs at 2am, copy-pasting auth logic, debugging cors, and wondering why You even started this project.

This Is The Moment Where Most People Quit Shipping.

And This Is Exactly The Moment **StackBindr** Walks Into The Room.

~~———————————————————————————————————————~~

# ️*️⃣ so what’s exactly StackBindr?

StackBindr is the AI layer that says:

**Yo. Stop Stressing. I’ll Connect Your No-Code Frontend To Your Coded Backend. Automatically.**

You bring —

* Your Framer/WebFlow frontend AND Your MYSQL/MongoDB/PHP/Node Backend

**StackBindr** Brings —

* Automatic API Generation, Field Mapping, Auth Setup, Data Flow

StackBindr Looks At Your Frontend. Understands What’s Happening. Looks At Your Backend. Understands What’s Needed. And Then Auto-weaves A Secure, Production-Ready API Layer Between Them.

Forms → Connected ; Databases → Synced ; Auth → Installed ; Logic → Wired ; Data → Flowing

IT LITERALLY BINDS YOUR ENTIRE STACK TOGETHER WITHOUT YOU TOUCHING FULL-STACK CODE. (*you can say this as “full stack without full stack”*) 🙌

~~———————————————————————————————————————~~

# 🥸 why does this matter?

Because the real bottleneck in 2025 Isn’t design. Isn’t creativity. Isn’t motivation.

It’s the unsexy part of building: **“Okay, Everything Looks Cool — Now How Do I Make It Actually Work?”**

No-Code tools gave us the ability to build beautiful stuff. But no one solved the bridge between “BEAUTIFUL” and “FUNCTIONAL.”

STACKBINDR IS THAT BRIDGE. 🧱🧱🧱

~~———————————————————————————————————————~~

Boom!   
You Just Shipped A Full Product Without The Pain.

CaptionIt - your photo our captions!,"Hello Reddit users! I want to share a cool app that my wife has been developing recently. Since she’s not a Reddit person, I’m making this post on her behalf.

The idea for the app was born pretty spontaneously. My wife loves Instagram, and most of her posts are photos rather than videos. To bring more story to a photo, she spends time writing a good or funny caption for each one. Later, ChatGPT came into play, but it has limitations on how many images you can process per day. So one time we were sitting, drinking coffee, and it hit us: it would be great to create an app that simplifies this whole process of posting photos to Instagram.

Over the next few weeks, we brainstormed how to make this app actually useful, not just another AI wrapper, but something with real value for users. As a result, the app using the latest ChatGPT model was born (believe it or not, not all the cheap models can do this job well).

What makes it different from a simple AI wrapper? Well, you can apply styling to your captions directly in the app, use custom fonts (which is pretty cool), easily reuse your previous captions, and start quickly with predefined moods. And last but not least, you can easily share your social media ready content, download it, or use the captions as stickers.

Personally, I don’t post on IG very often, but once I tried the app even me, an introvert, found it surprisingly fun, especially when generating captions in “Fuct Hunter” or sarcastic mood.

So if you find it interesting, give it a try. Sorry to Android users the app is currently available only on Apple devices.

"I built an AI “longevity coach” that combines facial scans, wearables and blood tests - looking for feedback","Hey everyone,

I’ve been working on a project called **Aion™** and I’d really appreciate some honest feedback from this community.

**Background / problem**

In my 30s I started to feel my energy, focus and drive slip, even though I was already tracking sleep, workouts and HRV with wearables. I had data scattered across Whoop/Oura/Apple Health and blood tests, but very little clarity on what to actually change day to day.

**What Aion does**

Aion tries to turn all of that into simple daily actions by combining:

* AI facial scans from your phone (stress, fatigue, recovery signals)
* Wearable data (Whoop / Oura / Apple Health: sleep, HRV, strain, etc.)
* Blood test analysis (hormones and key longevity markers)

The goal is to provide:

* A clear view of how your hormones, sleep, mood and recovery are trending over time
* Simple “do this today” suggestions (bedtime, caffeine timing, training intensity, light exposure, etc.)
* A way to see how things like testosterone and other longevity-related markers change as you tweak habits

There is a **7-day free trial** live so you can see it with your own data: [https://app.aionlongevity.com/](https://app.aionlongevity.com/)

**What I’d like feedback on**

* Does this solve a real problem you have, or does it feel like “just another dashboard”?
* What would make you actually keep using something like this beyond the first week?
* If you do try the trial: how was onboarding, clarity of the recommendations, general UX?

Aion is meant to sit on top of the tools and tests you already use and make the data more understandable and actionable.

If this sounds interesting and you’re willing to test it, I’m happy to answer questions, share more technical details, and hear what’s bad or confusing.

Thanks,

I built TicketWhiz - a free tool that helps people find the best priced tickets across major marketplaces in real time,"Hey everyone. I am building [TicketWhiz](http://ticketwhiz.com), a free tool that helps people find the best priced tickets across major marketplaces in real time and then sends them to the correct site to complete the purchase. The goal is to give fans clear pricing without needing to jump between multiple sites.

I would love honest feedback from the community. The product is still evolving and your thoughts genuinely shape what gets built next.

Here are the main areas I am trying to validate

1. How clear the experience feels when searching for event tickets
2. Whether the layout makes it easy to understand where each price is coming from
3. Whether the redirect flow feels smooth and trustworthy
4. What features you would expect from a modern ticket price discovery tool
5. Any friction or confusion that could prevent someone from using it regularly

Additional context

1. TicketWhiz is completely free to use
2. TicketWhiz earns a commission only when a fan completes a purchase
3. All pricing and data shown is pulled in real time

Specific questions

1. What is the first thing you would add
2. What is the first thing you would remove
3. What would make you switch from your current go to ticket site
4. What would make you trust or distrust a new ticket tool

Konut kredisinde gereğinden uzun vade seçmenin büyük zararı – küçük bir karşılaştırma aracı,"Konut kredisi çekerken en çok atlanan konu **vade karşılaştırması** oluyor.  
Birçok kişi 60 ay yerine 120 ay ,180 ay gibi daha uzun vadeyi seçtiğinde taksit düştüğü için bunun daha avantajlı olduğunu sanıyor.

Fakat gerçek şu ki:

* Vade uzadıkça **toplam geri ödeme inanılmaz artıyor**
* Gereğinden uzun vade seçildiğinde **boşa yıllarca faiz ödeniyor**
* Sadece birkaç yıl fark bile **yüz binlerce TL ekstra yük** oluşturabiliyor
* Faiz oranı yüksek olursa **vade uzamasına rağmen taksit düşmüyor**
* Boş yere yıllarca taksit ödeniyor

Bu durumu daha net görebilmek için küçük bir araç var:  
Aynı kredi tutarını farklı vadelerle karşılaştırıp **toplam geri ödeme farkını** saniyeler içinde görebiliyorsunuz.

We’re a small team from Korea and we’ve been experimenting with an AI character-chat concept.  
It’s super early and kinda rough, but we wanted to share it to see if the idea is even fun.



**What it does**

* You chat with a character
* There are story milestones you can clear
* Clearing them gives you a visual reward card
* You can create your own characters & scenarios
* And later, creators will be able to earn money if their characters/scenarios get popular

We honestly don’t know if this is a good idea or just weird 😂  
So if anyone here wants to test it and tell us what feels off, we’d really appreciate it.

I would love some feedback on my sideproject,"Hello there,

I would love some feedback on my Side Project that I have been working on for a bit more than a month.

[https://www.tierless.net](https://www.tierless.net)

It started like ""let's use some free time to make something interesting"" but now it basically turned into full time job. (Not really, but feels like it :D )

The idea is simple, if you don’t need a whole website or a heavyweight builder just to show your pricing my site will let you create a clean pricing page or an interactive calculator in a few minutes, without code. You get your QR code and you can easily have a prices for whatever you are doing updated in minutes. 

You can customize packages, add-ons, sliders, publish a public link and share it with clients. (Honestl that type of editor is still work in progress, but I feel like my first editor the one that lets you create menus or just pricing for whatever you offer is pretty much done done)

What I would love feedback on:

Considering a lot of things are not even finished, like not every button even works (Settings in Dashboard, Integrations, even templates are just place holders atm - they don't actually work) I would love more like feedback on the usefulness of this and maybe on working parts and if something you would add in this or remove.

I would appreciate any feedback tbh as I'm not having a lot of people would would help me test it (most of my friends are not into tech). I don't think I will finish this for a month or two, but it got to a point where I feel like it can at least be somewhat tested.

If somebody is interested in seeing how a finished price page would actually look like I made 2 so far that serve more or less as a demo

My aim with this app was to make opening your journal feel calm and inviting, not like using another productivity tool. A few of the core things I focused on:

🔒 Truly private and secure: Your entries are for your eyes only. You can lock your journal with your device Passcode or Face ID, and all data is stored securely on your device.  
  
🎨 Customizable look and feel: You can change backgrounds, wallpapers, and fonts so your journal feels personal and matches your mood.  
  
🧘 Small wellness touches: If you want a moment to settle before writing, you can start a short guided breathing session or reflect on a Quote of the Day and then write what you’re grateful for.  
  
📱 Made for iOS: A clean, native experience built for both iPhone and iPad so you can write wherever you are.  


Pricing: Free

"I built a ""Tinder for Research Papers"" to fix the way we explore new research","Hi everyone,

I wanted to share a project I’ve been working on called **PaperSwipe** ([https://paperswipe.co](https://paperswipe.co)).

**The Problem** As a researcher, I spent way too much time doom-scrolling through arXiv lists. I would open dozens of tabs based on titles alone, only to realize half of them weren't relevant. It felt like a chore, and I was missing out on interesting papers simply because the discovery process was so dry and text-heavy.

**The Solution** I built **PaperSwipe** to make discovering academic papers more intuitive. The core idea is based on **S. Keshav’s famous ""Three-Pass Approach""** to reading papers, but digitized into a fast workflow:

1. **First Pass (The Swipe):** You get a deck of papers (tailored to your interests like LLMs, CV, or Quantum). You swipe **Right** if the abstract looks interesting, or **Left** to skip. This lets you triage 50+ papers in minutes.
2. **Second Pass (Today's Hot):** The papers you liked go into a ""Hot"" list. You have 24 hours to review them—read the intro, check the figures, or preview the PDF.
3. **Third Pass (Deep Dive):** If a paper is truly relevant, you save it to a **Project**. This moves it to your permanent library for deep reading later.

**Key Features:**

* **AI Curation:** The more you swipe, the better the recommendations get.
* **Focus on Speed:** Designed to help you clear your daily reading list without tab overload.
* **Mobile Friendly:** Works great on phones so you can ""doom-scroll"" productive research instead of social media.
* **Currently covers:** arXiv categories (Computer Science, Physics, Math, etc.).

**Why I’m posting this:** I am currently in the **Alpha** phase and looking for genuine feedback.

1. Does the ""24-hour expiration"" in the Hot list help you focus, or is it annoying?
2. What other data sources (PubMed, BioRxiv, etc.) do you need most?
3. Any bugs you find?

It is free to use (with a generous free tier for daily saving), and you can check it out here:[**https://paperswipe.co**](https://paperswipe.co)

"I built a tool that turns runs, hikes, rides & road trips into physical 3D mementos","Hey everyone, I’m Darby. I’ve been working on a side project where I wrote my own code to turn GPS routes (runs, hikes, road trips, rides, swims, etc.) into **physical 3D topographic models** with the actual path etched into the terrain.

It started as a personal thing, butafter a few big trips and races I realised everything just lived as photos and GPX files on my phone. I wanted something physical to actually *see* day to day, so I built a pipeline that pulls elevation data, maps the route onto it, generates a mesh, and then 3D prints the final model. I also manually add stats, names and dates to each piece.

So far I’ve made them for:

* Runs & races
* Hikes & multi-day treks
* Road trips
* Rides (cycle & motorbike)
* Even some custom/fantasy maps

I’m still early and validating this as a real product, so I’d genuinely love feedback from this community:

* Does this feel like something people would actually pay for? Ive listed it for a price, is that too high?
* What price range would you expect for a custom physical piece like this?
* Does it feel complete as-is, or like it needs more features to feel “premium”?

Happy to answer any technical questions about the pipeline too if anyone’s curious (DEM → mesh → print).",Special_Principle691,1pc5ffk,SideProject,02-12-2025,10:49:33,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pc5ffk
I built a free Mac menu bar app to store terminal commands. It pastes them as comments so you don't accidentally execute them.,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been working on a small utility called **Command Shelf**.

Honestly, I built this because I have terrible memory for command flags during critical production issues where every second is important. Sometimes we also run commands accidentally by hitting enter after pasting them.

So I made this tool to fix that.

You search for a command, hit Enter, and the unique part is that **it pastes the command as a comment.**

Example: You search `tar`, it shows you variations of this command, you select one, paste and remove comment before running.

This forces you to check the syntax first, remove the `#`, and *then* run it. Saves you from breaking things in prod.

**Quick features:**

* Native-style Menu Bar app (built with Electron but optimised to be light).
* Fuzzy Search (handles typos).
* You can add your own custom scripts/snippets.
* Auto-syncs with a JSON source ( Read-only JSON source )
* **100% Free & Open Source.**

**Repo & Download:**[https://github.com/tharunShiv/command-shelf](https://github.com/tharunShiv/command-shelf)

  
Would love to know what you guys think or if there are any features I should add!

Promoting your AI tool… at almost no cost,"Hey founders,
I’ve been building my AI and SaaS-focused content pages for almost a year, and in that time my content has crossed 130M+ views across Instagram, Threads and Telegram. On Instagram alone, I’ve grown a community of 56k+ followers who actively engage with AI tools, SaaS products and tech updates.

I’ve helped multiple AI tools grow, including Perplexity AI, Cluely AI, Hastewire AI, Pixelchat AI, Raena AI, TryDecide AI, and many other early-stage products.

The last month has been slow for brand deals, and as a creator I still have ongoing expenses like:
• AI tool subscriptions
• automation costs
• editing tools
• Meta badge

To stay consistent without pausing my work, I’m offering something helpful for SaaS builders.

I’m giving:

• 1 paid UGC reel video
• + 2 free promo reels (feature breakdowns, demos, carousels or explainers)

If your SaaS or AI product is struggling to get attention or users, I can help you grow on Instagram.
My audience includes AI users, founders, developers, indie hackers, and tech enthusiasts, and my content often drives real traffic and new signups.

I’m building in public and trying to keep my project alive while helping more founders at the same time.

If you want visibility, UGC content, or high-engagement promo reels, feel free to comment or DM me.
Happy to support anyone building something valuable.

* Some require sign ups or at least want you to sign up
* Too many features that 90% of them I don't even use
* Limited habits, mostly bad habits and a limited amount of them
* Inability to export the habits or gate-kept behind login screens

* A local first Desktop/Android app built on Tauri and Sveltekit habit tracker that actually respects the user giving you only what you need.
* No logins
* Unlimited habits, whenever positive or negative or 1 or 100 of them.
* Data ownership, you own the data living on your device which you can easily export to CSV with one click.

[iOS] Age Calculator: Date of Birth – side project to track exact ages & birthday countdowns,"Hey r/SideProject 👋

I’ve been working on a small iOS app on the side called Age Calculator: Date of Birth and I’d love some feedback from you all.

What it does:

It’s a simple age calculator where you enter a date of birth and it shows:

* Age in years / months / days
* Total days lived
* Countdown to the next birthday
* The ability to save multiple people (kids, family, pets, clients, etc.)



Who it’s for 

* Parents who need exact age in months for doctor visits / milestones  
* Trainers / teachers who track age-based groups  
* People who enjoy “life stats” like days lived  
* Anyone who constantly forgets how old their relatives actually are 😅  



App details

* Pricing: Free



What I’d love feedback on

From a \*side project\* perspective, I’m especially curious about:

* UX/UI: Is the main screen clear and easy to understand?
* Features: Any age formats you think are missing (weeks, milestones like “10,000 days old”, etc.)?
* Retention: What would make you open this more than once (widgets, reminders, stats, something else)?

Generates a human readable summary
Shows “good for you / bad for you” terms
And you can sign the document afterwards

	a signing system
	clause detection

"Idea Validation: ""Stripe for Video"" - should I build this or am I crazy?","I'm a developer who got frustrated playing with ffmpeg for anime encoding (don't judge 😅) and thought ""why is video processing so damn complicated?""

**The Idea:** Media infrastructure as a service - think Stripe's simplicity, but for video.

You call an API, upload a video, and get back:

* Automatically transcoded to multiple qualities (1080p, 720p, 480p, etc.)
* Adaptive bitrate streaming (HLS/DASH)
* CDN delivery with low latency
* Drop-in video player (works on slow connections)
* Simple pricing based on storage + bandwidth

Basically ""batteries included"" video infrastructure for developers who don't want to become video encoding experts.

**Target customers:** Startups in ed-tech, content platforms, SaaS tools, corporate training - anyone adding video to their product.

**My hesitations:**

* This already exists (Mux, Cloudflare Stream, api.video)
* I have ZERO customers or connections in this space
* Video infrastructure has thin margins, needs scale
* Am I just building a cool tech project vs a real business?

**Questions:**

* Would you use something like this? What would you pay?
* How would I differentiate from existing players?
* Should I focus on a specific niche. rather than general-purpose?

Salus Sauna 10% Off Discount Code - RAY10,"I’ve had the Salus Sauna WEO for about a month and wanted to share an honest take since real reviews were hard to find.  
  
Heat performance is the biggest standout. It reaches 170–185°F consistently and heats up in around 15 minutes, which is better than most home units I’ve tried. The heat feels clean and even, and I sweat more in 20 minutes at home than I ever did at the gym.  
  
Build quality is solid. The panels are heavy, the interior feels premium, and nothing looks or feels cheap. Once assembled, it’s sturdy and doesn’t creak or shift. Setup took me and a friend about 90 minutes.  
  
Overall user experience has been great. I use it four to five times a week, and it’s noticeably improved sleep and recovery. It’s not a budget sauna, but the performance and quality justify the price. If you want a reliable, high-heat home sauna without going into ultra-luxury pricing, Salus is worth considering.

I’m an MS in AI engineer building a psychometrics-based adaptive SAT learning engine that uses Multidimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT) to adapt every question to a student’s most granular weaknesses. This isn’t another LLM wrapper or no-code tool — it’s fully engineered (backend + frontend + model logic).

**What the product currently does:**   
•	Estimates a student’s concept-level proficiency in real time   
•	Uses a multidimensional IRT (MIRT) model under the hood •	Generates a detailed mastery map (strengths + weaknesses)   
•	Chooses the next question to maximize information gain, target weak concepts, and adjust difficulty   
•	Includes enhanced spaced-repetition scheduling to resurface weak/forgotten concepts at the optimal time for retention

**What I’d love feedback on (brutally honest):**   
•	Product clarity — does the value proposition make sense quickly?   
•	Messaging — what feels confusing, missing, or too technical?   
•	Onboarding — is it obvious what a new user should do next?   
•	Retention — which features or screens would actually bring users back?   
•	Business model — does this read as B2C, B2B, or tutor-supplement?   
•	Anything that feels amateur, high-friction, or non-sticky

I built a tool because I couldn’t market my own product and I figured I wasn’t the only one.,"Hey Founders,  
I just launched [MyCMO](https://mycmo.io/) today. Here’s the short story behind it.

A few months ago, I realized something uncomfortable:

I was spending **10x more time building** my product than **talking about it**.  
And it showed, posts failed, SEO stayed untouched, and emails never went out.

Then I read a stat that felt too true:

**61% of founders say marketing is their biggest weakness**,  
yet **most don’t have the budget or time to fix it**.

That was me.

The moment everything clicked?

I spent *14 hours* building a feature and *40 minutes* trying to write a single LinkedIn post.  
It still got 3 likes (one from family).

That’s when I finally admitted:

My product wasn’t the problem.  
My **distribution** was.

So I started building set of small tools to solve the exact pains I kept running into:

* No content ideas → X, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok & YouTube Studios
* Copy felt robotic → Copy Refiner + Smart Reply
* Blogs/emails took forever → Blog Writer + Email Campaign
* Didn’t know my audience → Find Audience
* No GTM clarity → Growth Engine
* SEO overwhelming → SEO Optimiser + pSEO + Competitor Analyzer
* Needed quick direction → Growth Card
* Those pieces became [MyCMO](https://mycmo.io/) a simple marketing engine that basically acts as your **personal CMO**, without hiring, burnout, or chaos.

If you’re stuck in the same **“I’ll do marketing next week”** loop, this might help.

We have come to the end of the year and the wildest part is not the AI upgrades but how much faster projects can ship now. Here is my full year's experience -,"This year felt unreal. Every month there was some new AI push that everyone rushed to try.  
Better reasoning. Bigger context windows. Faster models.  
It almost felt impossible to keep up.  
But when I looked back at everything I built this year, I realised something unexpected.  
The biggest change was not the improvements in the models. It was how quickly I could turn ideas into something real.   
  
In January, building even a tiny side project still had the same rough steps.  
You sit with a blank doc and plan the workflow.  
You manually write out the logic. You connect APIs through Zapier and n8n.  
You juggle Notion tables and a Google Sheet or two just to keep things organised.  
You test something, break something, fix something, watch three YouTube videos, and then hope it works.  
Even simple ideas took a weekend or two.  
  
Around mid year, the shift started.  
Instead of hard coding flows, I was slowly describing them.  
Instead of building the skeleton myself, I found myself explaining what I wanted the system to do, kind of like how you would describe a prompt in claude or chatgpt..  
And weirdly, that alone cut my build time by more than half.  
The real turning point happened a few weeks ago.   
  
I tried the creation method where you literally type your entire workflow like you are messaging a teammate. It felt closer to talking through ideas in Linear or Slack rather than building in a traditional automation tool.  
Just before wrapping up the year I discovered and experimented with Vestra since it allowed this kind of conversation based building. I just wrote my workflow in plain English and it handled the heavy lifting. No nodes. No wiring. No technical setup.  
And I realised that this might be how many of us will build in 2026.   
  
Now I am genuinely curious how the rest of you experienced this shift.  
Did you feel your build speed increase or did conversational building make it easier?  
Would love to hear what changed for you and what you learned while building this year.",NITESH_2002,1pc4ndn,SideProject,02-12-2025,10:00:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pc4ndn/we_have_come_to_the_end_of_the_year_and_the/
Jolie Shower 20% Off Discount Code,"I’ve been using the Jolie showerhead for a few weeks and it’s actually a noticeable upgrade from a standard shower setup. The first thing I picked up on was the water pressure—still strong, but way softer on the skin. It feels more like a clean, even spray rather than the harsh needle-stream you get from cheap showerheads.  
  
Skin feels less tight afterward too, especially in winter when hard water usually wrecks me. It’s not some miracle device, but the filtered water genuinely makes showers feel cleaner and less harsh.  
  
Install took maybe two minutes. No leaking, no weird adjustments needed. The filter replacements are the only ongoing cost, but they’re simple to swap out, and at this point the improvement is worth it for me.  
  
If you’re dealing with hard water, dry skin, or just want a better shower experience without plumbing changes, Jolie is one of the few “premium” upgrades that actually does what it claims.

"I don't like the sidebar in windows file explorer, so I made a better version","Hello everybody,

I've been working on Dora, a custom file explorer, for a while now and there was something that was in need of an upgrade: The sidebar. So I looked at what windows offered and collected everything I didn't like about it. My list ended up being way longer than I thought, for such an essential feature.

* The sidebar is always there, there's no option to minimize. But since there's no splitting or complex operations anyway you don't really feel it. But since Dora offers a couple more options, that was a very important addition
* Pinned folders and system folders are treated the same and grouped together with other random folders, even though they're all very different
* Network drives are separated, probably because Microsoft wants to make OneDrive seem better or more important
* Sections can't be minimized, toggled on or off or changed in any meaningful way

I tried adressing all pain points and came up with the new update 0.5.3. I am really happy how it turned out!

How I’m saving 7+ hours a week as a solo content creator (and not burn out again),"i used to think content creation would be the fun part.

but being a one-person team = filming, editing, writing captions, resizing, cross-posting, posting manually, over and over again.

it honestly started to suck the joy out of it.

like i’d sit down to make something and just feel tired before i even started.

so i’ve been experimenting with a simple system lately to save time + headspace:

* 2 batch days per week (1 for creation, 1 for scheduling)
* prepping visuals in canva, reusing stuff instead of reinventing
* generating the captions with AI help using my own tool
* scheduling across all platforms in one go

has it solved everything? nope.

but saving even \~8 hours a week has made a *huge* difference in how i feel.

less “ugh i forgot to post”  
more “cool, what should i film next?”

i even ended up building a tiny tool to help me with all this. i wasn’t planning to, but the process kinda snowballed.

How localization nearly killed my baby tracker app (so I automated it),"I'm a solo dev. About a year ago I shipped a baby tracker app – you know, feeding times, sleep logs, diaper changes. The kind of thing sleep-deprived parents check 20 times a day.

It was doing okay in English. Then I looked at the analytics: lots of traffic from Spain, Germany, Poland. Parents there were bouncing because... well, ""Log feeding session"" doesn't mean much when you don't speak English.

So I decided to add Spanish, German, and Polish. Even for a ""simple"" app like a baby tracker, that's 1000+ strings. How hard could it be?

**The ChatGPT phase:** Copy string → paste → ""translate to Spanish"" → paste back → **repeat 1000+ times**. By string #150, ""Submit"" was ""Enviar"" in some places, ""Presentar"" in others. ChatGPT has no memory.

**The ""real tools"" phase:** Lokalise, Phrase – powerful stuff. Also $300+/month and way more complexity than I needed. I just wanted translations, not a localization department.

**The spreadsheet phase:** English column, Spanish column, German column. Felt productive for 2 hours. Still copy-pasting into ChatGPT, just from a different tab.

**The ""hire a translator"" phase:** Got a quote: **$2,800 for 3 languages**. I'm making **$0 MRR**. Next.

---

**The real problems nobody warned me about:**

- **Inconsistent terms** – ""Workspace"" became ""área de trabajo"" in settings, ""espacio de trabajo"" in navigation. Users notice.
- **Tone drift** – my casual indie app randomly read like corporate legalese in half the screens.
- **No context** – ""Save"" for a button? 4 chars max. Translator doesn't know that. UI broken in German.
- **Plurals & variables** – ""You have {count} message(s)"" is a nightmare. Most tools make it 10x more complex.
- **The ongoing grind** – new feature = translate again. I started avoiding features because localization sucked.

---

**So I built my own thing.**

Started as an internal tool. A year later, it's something others might actually use.

**How it works:**

- **MCP integration** – works with any AI-powered IDE (Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code + Copilot, etc.). Stay in your editor. Tell your AI: ""add translation 'checkout.success' in Spanish and German"" – done.
- **Remembers your style** – sees all existing translations before making new ones. If you use ""Enviar"" for buttons, it won't switch to ""Presentar"". Set tone once, it follows everywhere.
- **Context-aware** – tell it ""button, max 12 chars"" or ""error message for payment failure"" – it adapts. No more broken UI.
- **Central dashboard** – view, search, edit all translations. Simple strings and complex nested structures. Not a JSON file you're afraid to touch.
- **Prompt editor** – fine-tune how translations are generated. Add glossaries, manage templates.
- **Simple SDK** – integrate into your build pipeline if needed.

---

**Who this is for:**

- Vibe coders who want 5+ languages without enterprise complexity
- Solo devs / small teams who can't afford $3k per language
- Anyone tired of the copy-paste-translate-paste loop

**Not for:**

- Certified legal/medical translations → use humans
- 100k+ strings with complex workflows → Phrase/Lokalise

I built a multiplayer viral loop with no database costs (URL-based state).,"Hi all, just launched my MVP: [**WordSortGame.com**](http://WordSortGame.com)

It’s a competitive word puzzle game (Connections clone). I wanted to add a ""Challenge a Friend"" feature, but didn't want to deal with user auth or database costs for a simple side project.

**The Solution:** I built a ""Stateless"" challenge system. When you finish a puzzle, the app encodes your Score, Time, and Puzzle Seed directly into a URL parameter. When a friend clicks that link, the app decodes the params and sets up the ""Ghost"" timer for them to race against.

It allows for a competitive multiplayer experience with zero backend overhead.

**The Stack:** React + Tailwind + Vercel.

Anyone else building “boring” tools just to make your own life 10% easier?,"Lately I’ve been way more excited about tiny, boring side projects than “big idea” ones. I got tired of juggling tasks across Notion, Google Tasks, Slack reminders, etc., so I hacked together a super simple web app that just pulls everything into one “Today” view and nags me about only one thing at a time. No AI, no fancy UI, just a glorified list with some rules around what shows up when. But honestly, it’s been more useful to me than half the “proper” projects I’ve tried to build.

  
What I’ve noticed is: when the project directly solves a small everyday annoyance, I actually keep using it (and iterating on it), instead of abandoning it on GitHub after a weekend. The tradeoff is that it feels almost too simple to share, like “who would care about this besides me?” At the same time, a lot of products I use started as someone scratching their own itch with something super unsexy.

  
Curious how you all think about this: do you pursue side projects that are obviously “product worthy,” or do you just build small tools that make your own life 10% better and see what happens? Have you ever turned a “this is just for me” script/app into something you actually shipped or shared publicly?

Tinder for Research Papers. I built a tool to implement the 'Three-Pass' method for reading papers using a swipe interface,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share a project I’ve been working on called **PaperSwipe** (`paperswipe.co`).

**The Problem** As a researcher, I spent way too much time doom-scrolling through arXiv lists. I would open dozens of tabs based on titles alone, only to realize half of them weren't relevant. It felt like a chore, and I was missing out on interesting papers simply because the discovery process was so dry and text-heavy.

**The Solution** I built **PaperSwipe** to make discovering academic papers more intuitive. The core idea is based on **S. Keshav’s famous ""Three-Pass Approach""** to reading papers, but digitized into a fast workflow:

1. **First Pass (The Swipe):** You get a deck of papers (tailored to your interests like LLMs, CV, or Quantum). You swipe **Right** if the abstract looks interesting, or **Left** to skip. This lets you triage 50+ papers in minutes.
2. **Second Pass (Today's Hot):** The papers you liked go into a ""Hot"" list. You have 24 hours to review them—read the intro, check the figures, or preview the PDF.
3. **Third Pass (Deep Dive):** If a paper is truly relevant, you save it to a **Project**. This moves it to your permanent library for deep reading later.

**Key Features:**

* **AI Curation:** The more you swipe, the better the recommendations get.
* **Focus on Speed:** Designed to help you clear your daily reading list without tab overload.
* **Mobile Friendly:** Works great on phones so you can ""doom-scroll"" productive research instead of social media.
* **Currently covers:** arXiv categories (Computer Science, Physics, Math, etc.).

**Why I’m posting this:** I am currently in the **Alpha** phase and looking for genuine feedback.

1. Does the ""24-hour expiration"" in the Hot list help you focus, or is it annoying?
2. What other data sources (PubMed, BioRxiv, etc.) do you need most?
3. Any bugs you find?

It is free to use (with a generous free tier for daily saving), and you can check it out here:[**https://paperswipe.co**](https://paperswipe.co)

So I approached growth like an InfoSec problem. I built my own OSINT tool, [R00M 101](http://r00m101.com), to profile Reddit activity.

I've been testing multi-model AI workflows for building a SaaS — here's what I'm finding,"I've been experimenting with using Claude, GPT, and Gemini together instead of picking just one. Sharing my observations so far — curious if others are seeing similar patterns or completely different results. 

Context, I'm building a simple SaaS (menu page builder for restaurants). Needed to build landing page, dashboard UI, and various components. 

Instead of sticking to one model, I gave the same design tasks to all three and compared outputs. 



My observations:

Gemini: In my tests, it returned more specific design details. Actual hex codes instead of ""use a dark blue."" Specific animation timing. More opinionated about modern trends. Could be coincidence or my prompting style. 

Claude: Consistently better at integrating code into an existing codebase. Understands project structure, keeps TypeScript happy, respects conventions I've set. Feels like it ""gets"" the project context better.

ChatGPT models: Solid and reliable, but outputs felt safer/more generic for design work. Great for general tasks though. 



The workflow I'm testing:

I built a Claude Code skill that calls Gemini's API when I need design direction: 

1. Ask Claude to build a component 

2. Claude triggers the skill, sends design request to Gemini 

3. Gemini returns creative direction + rough code 

4. Claude cleans it up and integrates it properly



The UI feels less ""AI-generated"" than when I used a single model. But I've only tested this on one project, so take it with a grain of salt.",ign1000,1pc398l,SideProject,02-12-2025,08:28:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pc398l/ive_been_testing_multimodel_ai_workflows_for/
I got my first free-trial user by using my own product on Reddit,"If you don’t have an audience, Reddit is one of the best places to put your project in front of the right people.

I’m building [RedShip](https://redship.io/) and I’m using it myself.

It’s a funny “inception” feeling: I’m using my own product to promote it and also to promote my other projects.

The idea is simple: Reddit already has people talking about the problems you solve. You just need to show up in the right places.

From what I’ve learned, there are only **two real ways** to reach people on Reddit:

**1. You publish**

But you need to be very smart about it. Most subreddits hate direct self-promotion, so the post has to be useful and relevant.

**2. You comment**

If you find the right conversations early, you can add value naturally and people will check out what you’re building on their own.

That’s exactly how I got my first free-trial user for RedShip.

I found a perfect thread using my own tool, left a helpful comment, and someone activated the trial shortly after.

I’ve seen this before too. On another project of mine, I brought **10,000+ visitors** just by being active in the right subreddits. When you master Reddit, it’s insanely powerful, especially when you’re starting with zero audience.

AI Release Tracker - Track major AI model releases,"A couple of days ago I realized it’s almost been 3 years since ChatGPT launched on Nov 30, 2022 and kicked off the AI boom. I thought, what if there was a simple way to see how fast things have evolved, which sparked an idea: an AI release tracker. It lets you get notified when new AI models drop and shows when the next releases are expected and much more.  
  
Would love your feedback.

"10 years of building deep-tech (GovTech, IoT, 3D). Where did all the complex projects go?","I’ve been a CTO for over a decade. I’ve grown accustomed to the ""pain"" of real engineering.
I’m talking about the headaches of building LPR systems for state police to track stolen vehicles in real-time. Or handling raw sensor data pipelines for industrial beer brewing. Or figuring out how to generate runtime builds for a gaming platform so it scales to thousands of white-label clients.

We used to argue about database architecture, latency optimization, and custom 3D rendering pipelines (Gaussian splats are a nightmare, but a fun one).
But lately, I feel like I’m losing my mind.
99% of the ""startups"" I see today are just:
User Input -> LangChain -> OpenAI API -> UI.

Don't get me wrong, AI is incredible. But where are the architectural challenges? Where are the projects that require actual systems design? It feels like we traded complex problem-solving for prompt engineering. I’m looking for projects that are meant to last longer than a celebrity marriage, but all I see are wrappers that become obsolete the next time Sam Altman tweets.

So, serious question:
Is anyone here working on a ""boring,"" messy, complex problem? Something that actually requires a custom backend, weird hardware integration, or heavy data lifting?

PouchLog - I built a free nicotine pouch tracker app because I couldn't find a good one,"Hi everyone,

(Sorry for the self-promo, but this is a hobby project, completely free, open to feedback, and has zero ads).

I’ve been using nicotine pouches for a while, and I often found myself losing track of how many I actually popped during the day. ""Was that my 5th or 8th?"" – I had no clue. I looked for a decent tracker app, but most were either paid, clunky, or just didn't fit my needs.

So I decided to build my own tool. It’s called **PouchLog**.

It started as a simple counter for myself, but I kept adding features that I thought would be cool. Now that it’s polished, I figured I’d share it here in case it helps anyone else manage their intake or quit.

**Key Features:**

* **📚 Huge Database:** Pre-loaded with hundreds of pouches (Zyn, Velo, Siberia, Pablo, etc.) with accurate **MG PER POUCH** strengths (no more confusing mg/g calculations), or you can add your own custom ones.
* **📉 Track or Quit:** You can use it just to log your daily usage (Quantified Self style) OR switch to a ""Quit Plan"" with guided tapering strategies (Smooth, Weekly, or Cold Turkey).
* **📱 Native-like Experience:** It’s a PWA (Progressive Web App). You can add it to your home screen on iOS or Android and it works exactly like a native app.
* **📊 Analytics:** Detailed charts showing your trends, daily averages, nicotine intake, and money spent.
* **🏆 Gamification:** Earn badges for streaks, lowering your intake, or hitting savings milestones.
* **💸 Cost Tracking:** See exactly how much you are spending (or saving).

It is completely free to use and there are NO ads. I'm just hosting it to help the community.

I built a small career-intelligence tool,"Hey everyone — I’ve been working nights/weekends on a small side project and wanted some brutally honest feedback from this community.

The Problem I kept running into

ChatGPT gives great one-off advice,
but it can’t compare roles consistently or track patterns across multiple jobs. Every prompt is a reset.

I wanted something that:
	•	Analyzes a resume + LinkedIn + job description
	•	Scores role fit on a consistent model
	•	Highlights patterns across multiple job applications
	•	Gives a psychographic profile so guidance is personalized
	•	Lets users compare roles (“This Meta PM job matches you better than the Amazon one”)

What I built (prototype)

It’s called Sage — a simple career intelligence tool.

It can:
	•	Parse a resume/LinkedIn
	•	Extract job descriptions from links
	•	Generate a psychographic profile
	•	Score fit using a consistent rubric
	•	Track weaknesses/strengths across jobs
	•	Give actionable recommendations

	•	Would you trust this type of analysis?
	•	Should I keep it niche (role-fit) or expand into broader career intelligence?

Salus Sauna 10% Off Discount Code - RAY10,"I’ve had the Salus Sauna WEO for about a month and wanted to share an honest take since real reviews were hard to find.

Heat performance is the biggest standout. It reaches 170–185°F consistently and heats up in around 15 minutes, which is better than most home units I’ve tried. The heat feels clean and even, and I sweat more in 20 minutes at home than I ever did at the gym.

Build quality is solid. The panels are heavy, the interior feels premium, and nothing looks or feels cheap. Once assembled, it’s sturdy and doesn’t creak or shift. Setup took me and a friend about 90 minutes.

Overall user experience has been great. I use it four to five times a week, and it’s noticeably improved sleep and recovery. It’s not a budget sauna, but the performance and quality justify the price. If you want a reliable, high-heat home sauna without going into ultra-luxury pricing, Salus is worth considering.

Jolie Shower 20% Off Discount Code,"I’ve been using the Jolie showerhead for a few weeks and it’s actually a noticeable upgrade from a standard shower setup. The first thing I picked up on was the water pressure—still strong, but way softer on the skin. It feels more like a clean, even spray rather than the harsh needle-stream you get from cheap showerheads.

Skin feels less tight afterward too, especially in winter when hard water usually wrecks me. It’s not some miracle device, but the filtered water genuinely makes showers feel cleaner and less harsh.

Install took maybe two minutes. No leaking, no weird adjustments needed. The filter replacements are the only ongoing cost, but they’re simple to swap out, and at this point the improvement is worth it for me.

If you’re dealing with hard water, dry skin, or just want a better shower experience without plumbing changes, Jolie is one of the few “premium” upgrades that actually does what it claims.

I built AlgoArena — LeetCode practice meets Chess.com battles,"Tired of grinding LeetCode alone? I built AlgoArena to combine practice with real-time competition.

The problem: LeetCode is async-only. CodeForces contests are long. Pramp requires scheduling. I wanted something that felt like [Chess.com](http://Chess.com) but for algorithms.

What I built: AlgoArena — real-time 1v1 coding battles with ELO matchmaking. You queue up, get matched with someone at your skill level (±25 ELO), solve the same problem, and first to pass all tests wins. Your rating goes up or down based on the result.

Key features:

* ⚔️ Live 1v1 battles — synchronized problem solving
* 📊 ELO ranking system — Chess.com-style matchmaking
* 🎓 5000+ problems — LeetCode-style library
* 🤖 AI mock interviewer — 24/7 voice-powered practice
* ⚡ 60+ languages — Judge0 integration
* 👥 Friend battles — challenge friends directly
* 🏆 Daily challenges — compete on leaderboards

Why it’s different: Most platforms are either solo practice (LeetCode) or async contests (CodeForces). AlgoArena adds live competition with instant feedback, which helps with interview pressure and motivation.

Still early, but the battles are live and working. Would love feedback from fellow developers.

I'm a sculptor who got tired of taking bad photos of my work so I started building an app to fix it,"I build sculptures for exhibits. Big weird stuff. The work is fun but my portfolio photos have always been trash because I never have time to actually photograph anything properly. I finish a piece, it gets installed, and I have like five minutes to snap something on my phone before I'm onto the next thing. No lights. No backdrop. Just whatever fluorescent nightmare is hanging from the ceiling.

So I've been messing around with building an iOS app that takes a rough phone photo and turns it into something that looks like it was shot in an actual studio. Pick a background, adjust the lighting, and it spits out something way better than what I started with.

I've never built an iOS app before. I've been a fabricator my whole career. But I got frustrated enough to try and honestly it's been kind of wild seeing it come together. Still very much a work in progress but the results are already surprising me.

Anyway just wanted to share because I'm excited about it. If anyone wants to follow along or eventually try it out I threw up a waitlist at [waitlist.feivorfab.com](http://waitlist.feivorfab.com) but mostly I'm just curious if anyone else has run into this same problem with product photos.

I built a digital receipt management platform because paper receipts are basically useless. Would love feedback.,"Hey everyone — I’ve been working on this for a while and finally launched the beta version on the iPhone App Store. Would love honest feedback from this community.

**PROBLEM**

Paper receipts suck — they get lost, fade, clutter wallets, and offer zero actual value.  
“Digital receipts” aren’t much better — they hit your inbox, get buried, come with promo spam, and still aren’t organized.

**WHAT I BUILT**

KACHNG — a digital receipt platform that processes, stores, and organizes all your digital receipts using a **dedicated purchase address**.

You sign up → get a [*name@kachng.co*]() address → use it anywhere that offers digital receipts → they show up instantly, neatly organized inside the app.

**Important:** This doesn’t replace your personal email.  
It works *alongside* it — a clean lane just for receipts so your main inbox stays uncluttered. All digital receipts go to KACHNG, important emails get filtered and sent to your personal email you used to sign up for KACHNG. 

**WHY I BUILT IT**

Receipts actually contain a lot of value — returns, warranties, expenses, taxes, budgeting insights — but they’re scattered everywhere. Traditional email is not built to handle a receipt. Digital Receipts are 1000x better than paper. Everyday people are loosing out on tremendous value. 

I wanted something actually *useful*, not noisy.

**WHAT IM LOOKING FOR FROM YOU**

I’d love feedback on:

• onboarding flow  
• clarity of the value prop  
• UI/UX  
• what you expected but didn’t see  
• what felt confusing

I built an ambient music site for D&D sessions with Claude Code - took about 2-3 iterations to go live,"Had this idea for a while - an ambient music site for tabletop RPG sessions. Finally made it happen with Claude Code.

https://dndmusic.net

It's got 12 scene-based Spotify playlists (tavern, battle, dungeon, forest, etc.) with layerable ambient sounds on top - rain, fire, crowd noise, that kind of thing.

The wild part is I didn't even have to find the playlists myself. Claude Code found them for me, built the whole thing, and I just tweaked it maybe 2-3 times before it was live.

I built a private offline task & reminder app with voice input. Feedback appreciated,"Hi everyone,  
I made an Android app called **Taskly** because I wanted a reminder app that was fast, private, and didn’t require an account or cloud syncing.

The app lets you add tasks either by typing or by speaking in English.  
Voice recognition needs internet to process the speech, but all tasks stay **only on your device** — nothing is uploaded or stored online.

Key features:

* Add reminders by voice or typing
* Tasks stay offline and private
* No registration, no accounts, no syncing
* Edit or delete tasks easily with confirmation prompts
* Clear handling of dates and times (When extract data from text is on in settings -> requires internet) (“Remind me tomorrow at 9 AM…”)
* Required permissions are only microphone + notifications
* Ads are minimal and don’t interact with your data

I’d appreciate any feedback from this community — usability, missing features, bugs, anything you notice.

I built a Python script that enriches government Layoff lists (WARN notices) with decision-maker contacts. Roast my idea.,"I noticed that government WARN sites (layoff lists) are public but messy. They list the company name but never the contact info.

So I built a scraper that:

1. Pulls the daily PDF/HTML lists from CA, NY, and TX.
2. Matches the company to LinkedIn.
3. Finds the **Head of HR** or **VP of People** automatically.

I just ran it for November and found about 500 leads that aren't on standard lists yet.

I killed my AI meal planner and built something simpler - testing a shuffle-based approach,"I spent longer than I care to admit building an AI-powered meal planner. Screenshot recipes, extract ingredients, generate weekly plans. I thought it was sophisticated stuff.

Then I watched my wife ignore it. My first users tried it once and never came back. Even I found excuses not to use the feature.

**My theory:** It was too complicated. AI generation sounds cool, but in practice you're spending time reviewing and tweaking an algorithm's suggestions. That's not less work - it's just different work.

I overheard someone talking about their meal planning system: a dice roller with three categories (meat, side, side) and six options each. Roll dice, fate decides. Simple. And they actually used it for a whole week.

So I rebuilt around that concept. Here's the test version:

1. Hit shuffle - get a week of simple combos
2. Auto-generated shopping list
3. Swap individual days if you don't like them

No AI deciding for you. No recipe instructions. Just ""Tuesday: Salmon + Pasta + Broccoli + Garlic Butter.""

(You can still screenshot actual recipes and use those in your plans too - that OCR stuff still works. But the core is just simple plate combos.)

**But I honestly don't know if this is better.** It's simpler, but maybe too simple? Maybe people need full recipes? Maybe the palette approach doesn't work for how real families cook?

That's why I'm posting. I need people to actually try it and tell me:

* Is this too basic?
* Does the shuffle make sense?
* What's missing?
* Would you actually use this?

Try it at [snapmealplan.com](http://snapmealplan.com) (free, no credit card). Break it. Tell me what's wrong. I'm genuinely testing whether simple beats sophisticated.",SnapMealPlan,1pc0od4,SideProject,02-12-2025,05:50:56,https://i.redd.it/bj442n8ubq4g1.jpeg
Building a directory-style WP tool as a side project — looking for feedback on multi-type structure,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been working on a side project that’s basically a **directory-style plugin for WordPress**. I know that sounds pretty common, but the reason I started building it was because I wanted something that could handle **multiple types of listings** in a single installation — without needing 5 different add-ons.  


The main idea is to allow users to create several kinds of directory content (services, places, items, events, etc.) and manage them under one system. It’s been fun, but also way more challenging than I expected.

  
These are some of the issues I’m working through:

* designing a structure that supports different listing types without becoming bloated
* deciding how flexible custom fields should be
* making filtering and browsing smooth even when thousands of items exist
* balancing simplicity for beginners and customization options for advanced users
* preventing performance issues that usually happen with directory-style setups

I’d really appreciate input from anyone who has built something similar — whether a plugin, SaaS, or any kind of directory system.

  
**My main questions:**

1. What’s the cleanest way to handle multiple listing types in one directory environment?
2. Are there common pitfalls when working with user-submitted listings?
3. If you’ve ever built a directory tool, what was the hardest part?

I’m not dropping links or promoting anything — I’m genuinely looking for advice from other makers before moving further into development.

A few prompts I’ve been using to start and shape business ideas lately,"I’ve been putting together a little collection of prompts for myself while exploring a few new business ideas. Nothing fancy — just the kind of prompts that help you get your thoughts out of your head and into an actual plan.

Here are a few that have been genuinely helpful:

# 1. Business Plan Starter Prompt

When I’m trying to turn a rough idea into something structured, I use this:

    I’m working on a business concept. Please help me shape a simple business plan including:
    
    • Problem Statement – what problem this solves and why it matters  
    • Target Customer – who this is for, with basic demographic/psychographic notes  
    • Proposed Solution – short explanation of what the business offers  
    • Unique Value – what makes this different  
    • Revenue Model – where the income comes from  
    • Marketing & Sales – how customers will find it  
    • Key Assumptions – anything important that must be validated  
    • Competitive Landscape – who else is doing something similar
    

# 2. Market Research Prompt

This one is great when you’re trying to understand whether an idea has real demand:

    I’m testing a business idea: [describe your idea].
    
    Please help me do a lightweight research overview including:
    
    • Problem & Demand – who feels this problem most, and why  
    • Existing Solutions – direct and indirect competitors  
    • Search patterns – how people look for this problem online  
    • Customer Language – phrases, frustrations, or motivations people use  
    • Gaps & Opportunities – where the idea might fit or stand out
    

# 3. Logo Prompt

For when you want a first draft or a direction before hiring someone:

    Using an image generator, create a logo concept for a brand called [Name].
    
    Details to include:
    • Brand identity keywords: [3–5 adjectives]  
    • Target audience description  
    • Style preference (e.g., wordmark, modern, abstract, playful, minimal)  
    • Any references or colours to consider  
    • Emotional tone the logo should evoke
    

# 4. Branding Prompt

This helps build an early brand direction without overthinking it:

    I have a business called [Your Business Name] and the concept is [brief summary].
    
    Please create:
    • A short brand story  
    • A clear voice/tone guide  
    • Suggested colour palette (with hex codes)  
    • Font pairing ideas  
    • Logo direction or style notes  
    • A few tagline options  
    • A simple moodboard description with imagery themes
    

# 5. Pitch Deck Prompt

If you want a clean outline to work from:

    Create a pitch deck outline for a business called [Name] offering [product/service].
    
    Sections:
    • Problem  
    • Solution  
    • Why Now  
    • Market Overview  
    • Business Model  
    • Go-To-Market Plan  
    • Product Details  
    • Traction (or expected milestones)  
    • Competitive Landscape  
    • Team  
    • Financial Snapshot  
    • The Ask
    

These prompts have made the early brainstorming phase way easier for me — it’s less about “getting it perfect” and more about getting enough clarity to take the next step.

Think Facebook Memories - but for your chats,"My son was with his dad over Thanksgiving — so I made another app.  I was looking at my Facebook Memories and realized I don’t have those with my current partner. We don’t post on social media. Our relationship lives in our messages - His birthday was coming up so I figured...I could probably make this happen.  If messages are where the meaningful stuff is, we just need a way to export and analyze it.  So I started playing with an idea: what if chats surfaced memories the way Facebook does — but for conversations, not posts?

That turned into Remember-lings. It takes a message history (iMessage, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Google Message. and turns the endless scroll into something readable and reflective, pulling out moments, patterns, and quotes you forgot were there.

I wasn't surprised that I got it to work...but I was surprised at the extra use cases I found when I was testing

* Parenting chats full of funny, questionable moments that never got photographed or posted on social media - like when my kid was allowed to pop balloons with a knife during 2020...prime parenting over here. 
* Early relationships where rereading the beginning takes you back to those emotional highs
* Family threads where you rediscover things like the year my brother wanted us all in full Canadian tuxedos for a family photo

It started as a birthday gift idea for someone special and… here we are. [https://www.remember-lings.live/](https://www.remember-lings.live/)

I know everyone is worried about data with an AI tool - we did vibe code the app, and we use AI to analyze the chats - but the settings are configured to not use the inputs/outputs to store the data or train the models.

Salus Sauna 10% Off Discount Code - RAY10,"I’ve had the Salus Sauna WEO for about a month and wanted to share an honest take since real reviews were hard to find.

Heat performance is the biggest standout. It reaches 170–185°F consistently and heats up in around 15 minutes, which is better than most home units I’ve tried. The heat feels clean and even, and I sweat more in 20 minutes at home than I ever did at the gym.

Build quality is solid. The panels are heavy, the interior feels premium, and nothing looks or feels cheap. Once assembled, it’s sturdy and doesn’t creak or shift. Setup took me and a friend about 90 minutes.

Overall user experience has been great. I use it four to five times a week, and it’s noticeably improved sleep and recovery. It’s not a budget sauna, but the performance and quality justify the price. If you want a reliable, high-heat home sauna without going into ultra-luxury pricing, Salus is worth considering.

How I keep my side project organized without overcomplicating it,"One of the hardest parts of working on a side project (for me, at least) isn’t building the thing, it’s keeping track of *everything*: ideas, features, feedback, tasks, screenshots, experiments, future plans…

I tested a few setups and ended up using a super simple system in Notion to stay consistent:

* One page for the main idea + vision
* A backlog for feature ideas
* A basic task board (this week / next / later)
* Notes from users / testers
* A log of what I tried and what worked or failed

No fancy automations, just one place where everything lives.

If you’re working with a small team or a more “serious” side project, there’s also a way to try Notion’s Business plan free for 3 months with a business email (your own domain, not Gmail/Outlook). Easy to find by searching.

Korea Compass – A simple map to track all 162 cities you've visited in Korea,"Hi Side Projectors,

I built a small tool called Korea Compass after realising I had no idea which cities and regions of Korea I’d actually visited. Google Maps lists and scattered notes were too focused on individual places, not the high-level view I wanted. So I made a simple map that shows my travel progress by city.  


**What it does**

• Lets you mark all 162 cities in Korea

• Tag places as visited, loved, or want-to-visit

• Save food spots or memorable locations

• See your progress on a clean map

• Optional leaderboards if you want to compare with others  


**What I’d like feedback on**

• Is the map easy to understand?

• Are the tags/categories clear?

• Anything you’d expect a travel tracker to have that’s missing?

"30 people bought my app, couldn’t be more happier","Few months ago I decided to build a quit smoking app. I didn’t know where to start, how to launch, where to market, or how to get any sales. 

I’ve tried everything, you name it, I still have so much to learn but.. fast forward to today, I got that notification that made me smile “New Subscriber”, with that I hit my 30th sale. 

To most people it might be just a small number, but to me it proves there are people who wants it. Also, I have only 10 reviews but each one of them is 5 star, so very happy to see people liking it. 

It’s a niche app, but about 55% paywall rate seems very good, and my installs -> paid conversion from latest paywall is about 8% which seems higher than industry average. 

Of course it’s a small data to say anything, but I am lucky to help people with a real problem. 

Next step: 
1. I’ve hired a UGC creator so going to reinvest each and every dollar and test a lot. 
2. Focus on ASO

Will this multi-API SaaS idea actually solve a real problem? Looking for honest feedback.,"Hey everyone,
I’m planning to build a developer-focused SaaS platform that offers a collection of APIs for common but annoying document tasks — things like Word → PDF, PDF → Word, Excel → PDF, PDF merge/split, image → PDF, OCR for scanned documents, etc. All conversions would be done in-memory (no file storage) for privacy, and developers would get API keys + clear metered usage + simple pricing.


So my question to you all:

• Is there still room for a developer-friendly API product here?
• Would you (or your company) actually pay for a reliable conversion API?
• What features or differentiators would make this worth switching to?
• Are privacy + accuracy + automation enough of a reason?
• Or is this idea already done to death?

I’m also open to hearing brutally honest feedback — if the idea is weak, I’d rather know before building the full product.

A tiny chat web app I built for my kids after a funny parenting moment,"It’s 1st December and I’ve been using the “you-know-who’s watching” line for the last couple of weeks when my two oldest (5f, 2m) are playing up.

My oldest caught me off guard when I first broke it out… I told them that I’d “call him later” if they didn’t start behaving, expecting them to immediately back down — but my oldest just asks:

“Can I speak to him?”

Immediate lightbulb moment 💡”Of course you can darling”

After their bedtimes I started cobbling something together on the computer so they could talk to him on a magic messenger.

The look on her face when she got a reply that mentioned their names… unreal.

I cleaned it up a bit (but defos needs more work) and put it online in case other parents want to try it too.

I built a tool that tracks your booked flights for price drops and automatically refunds you— looking for feedback on the MVP,"Hey everyone 

For the last couple weeks, I’ve been working on a simple tool called **FlightDrop** — it automatically tracks the price of flights *after* you book, and alerts you if the fare drops so you can get airline credits back.

Most people don’t realize this, but many airlines will actually give you a travel credit if your flight gets cheaper after you’ve purchased it… **but only if you catch the drop yourself**, and the window is usually tiny.

The problem is:

* Nobody manually checks their booked flights
* Price-drop policies vary by airline
* Most travelers miss out on free credits

So I'm trying to automate this whole process.

# How it works

1. You book a flight anywhere
2. Forward your confirmation email to FlightDrop
3. We monitor the fare price 24/7
4. If the price drops, you get an alert + instructions to claim the credit

# Why I'm building it

I kept missing out on price drops on my own flights (found out later I could’ve saved \~$200), so this is scratching my own itch first.

I'd love feedback on:

* The landing page clarity
* Whether this solves a real pain point
* Anything confusing or missing
* Your gut reaction: would you use this?

I'll Coach You for Free (literally no strings attached),"Hey 👋 my name's Ashley and I'm a productivity coach for ambitious underperformers. I just reached 5k followers on Instagram, and want to start my productivity coaching service.

I'd like to coach you completely free so I can get some testimonials under my belt. I'll never ask you to pay anything, but I'd appreciate it if you gave me an honest testimonial :)

Basically, I help people stop procrastinating and take action towards their goals. I know what it's like to know what you need to do, but feel unmotivated and procrastinate all day.

The service (again, 100% free for you, not selling anything) is made up of weekly calls and daily check-ins via text.

On the first call, I'd work with you to

\- Identify your long-term goal(s)

\- Define the key results you need to accomplish every 4 months, month, week, and day

\- Identify your main obstacles and procrastination patterns

\- Design a strategy to reach your long-term goal(s)

\- Identify solutions to your specific obstacles

Then we'd do weekly calls from then on for 3 weeks to track your progress, and I'd do daily check-ins via text to keep you accountable every day.

I want to help you become the most productive version of yourself. (As well as get some honest testimonials for myself :) If you're interested, please leave a comment and I'll dm you.

Jolie Shower 20% Off Discount Code,"  
I’ve been using the Jolie showerhead for a few weeks and it’s actually a noticeable upgrade from a standard shower setup. The first thing I picked up on was the water pressure—still strong, but way softer on the skin. It feels more like a clean, even spray rather than the harsh needle-stream you get from cheap showerheads.  
  
Skin feels less tight afterward too, especially in winter when hard water usually wrecks me. It’s not some miracle device, but the filtered water genuinely makes showers feel cleaner and less harsh.  
  
Install took maybe two minutes. No leaking, no weird adjustments needed. The filter replacements are the only ongoing cost, but they’re simple to swap out, and at this point the improvement is worth it for me.  
  
If you’re dealing with hard water, dry skin, or just want a better shower experience without plumbing changes, Jolie is one of the few “premium” upgrades that actually does what it claims.  
  
You can use the link below to get a 20% off discount as well. Hope it helps!

I built SnippetBase — a developer knowledge base to stop Googling the same code repeatedly,"Like most developers, I found myself searching the same patterns over and over: PySpark window functions, SQL dedup queries, dbt macros, Airflow DAG templates, and Python utilities that I hadn’t used in a few weeks.

I kept jumping between old notes, outdated snippets, blog posts, StackOverflow threads, and random GitHub gists just to find something I had already solved in a previous project. It was slowing me down more than I realized.

So a couple of months ago, I decided to build something for myself — a clean, fast, searchable place where all my frequently used, production-ready snippets could live in one place. That turned into SnippetBase.

What it currently includes:

• 153 code snippets across PySpark, SQL, Python, dbt, Airflow, Databricks, Kafka, Docker, and more
• 27 cheat sheets across 21 categories
• Search across titles, tags, descriptions, and even the code itself
• Syntax highlighting with line numbers
• One-click copy for all code blocks
• Favorites and usage tracking saved locally
• Fully responsive neobrutalist design
• Fast performance using React, Vite, Tailwind, and Prism.js
• Works offline through localStorage

Everything is built from scratch: the content, design system, search algorithm, data structure, routing, and UI.

I’m continuing to add more categories like FastAPI, Terraform, vector databases, LLM engineering, and advanced Spark optimizations. If you have recommendations or if you try it and notice any gaps, I’d appreciate your feedback.

"Changing prompts shouldn’t require a deploy, so I built something that lets you test versions instantly","I’ve been building a few AI products over the past year, and one thing that kept slowing me down was giant prompts cluttering my backend code. Some of my classes were turning into 300+ lines of prompt instructions. Every time I needed to tweak a sentence or try a new variation, I had to touch the codebase, commit, deploy… repeat. It was a painfully slow loop.

So I finally built something to fix that for myself, and ended up turning it into a proper product: Vaultic.

It basically separates prompt management from your actual code. Instead of hard-coding giant prompts, you pull clean versions from Vaultic via API or you can install an SDK, test different versions, run A/B experiments, tag prompts, track changes, etc. It’s been a game-changer for my workflow.

It’s also super helpful for teams where prompt engineers, PMs, copywriters, or domain experts want to update prompts without having to touch the code or bother developers for every tiny change.

Some of the stuff built in:

* Audit logs for every prompt change
* API logs so you can see what’s happening in real time
* Role-based access control
* Versioning + A/B testing support
* Starter API kit with a PHP SDK (more SDKs coming)
* Enterprise-ready setup out of the box

* Solve one annoying problem for someone you know
* Keep the tech simple so people actually use it
* Charge for ongoing support instead of one time builds
* Watch their real workflow instead of what they describe in meetings

For the past year, I've been thinking and experimenting with how AI chat interfaces will actually evolve, what they'll look like in, say, 5 years.

* Forms the AI can create on the fly to gather what you need before searching

And experimented with lots of other prototypes and concepts.



I'm releasing it now, so I can hear and learn from what people think and want, what works for you when you use AI now, and what would make it better...

What’s one problem you wish you could think through more clearly?,"Lately I’ve been experimenting with using AI to improve how I think, not just how fast I work.

It’s wild how much easier life gets when I can slow my brain down, unpack a problem, and see the next step without getting overwhelmed.

So I’m curious —
If you could choose one area of your life or work where you want more clarity, what would it be?

Not advice, not judgment — just honest answers.

Made a discord accountability buddy browser extension 🐀,"Hey everyone!

I have zero self-control. I tried generic site blockers, but I just turn them off when I ""need a quick break"" (which turns into 2 hours of doom-scrolling).

I realized the only thing that actually motivates me is fear of embarrassment. So I built SnitchBuddy.

It connects to your Discord server. If you visit a blacklisted site (like Reddit... the irony is not lost on me) during your set ""work hours,"" it instantly posts a message to your friends exposing you.

Piye - AI Mentor For Devs,"Many developers often find themselves saying, “I know the feature I want to build… but I don’t know where to start.” This uncertainty can arise when trying to implement features like:  
  
\- Email login  
\- Dark mode  
\- Admin dashboard  
\- Comments system  
\- Notifications  
  
Feature scoping can be difficult, but PIYE Feature Mentor simplifies the process. It transforms vague ideas into:  
  
\- A structured breakdown  
\- Milestones  
\- Tasks  
\- Suggested API and UI considerations  
\- Architecture hints  
  
For example, consider the feature description: “Add Google OAuth login to my Next.js app.” The accompanying screen recording will provide:  
  
\- Clear milestones  
\- Step-by-step tasks  
\- Technical hints  
\- Suggested libraries

Have you ever shipped too much UX before validating the core pain?,"I’m deep into a side project that streamlines the workflow between LinkedIn and CRMs like Salesforce/HubSpot. The core pain is clear: people hate copy-pasting profile data and notes into their CRM.



I started with a simple “1-click sync” Chrome extension idea. Then I added:

\- AI lead scoring against an ideal customer profile

\- Auto-generated connection requests and outreach messages

\- Some UI polish to make everything feel native in LinkedIn



Now I’m wondering if I’ve gone too far before really pressure-testing the \*basic\* value: just removing manual data entry.



For builders in r/sideproject:



\- Have you ever realized you overbuilt before validating the simplest version of the solution?

\- How did you roll things back or refocus without throwing away months of work?

\- Any tricks for testing whether users actually care about the “smart” features vs. just wanting the boring, reliable automation?



Would love to hear how you’ve navigated this, especially with browser extensions or workflow tools.",nathan-zhou,1pbsn6k,SideProject,01-12-2025,23:36:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pbsn6k/have_you_ever_shipped_too_much_ux_before/
I built an life coach for overthinkers who love AI but hate habit trackers,"I'm an AI power user - I use Claude, ChatGPT, DeepSeek and whatever works best for life advice, goal planning, ""should I take this job,"" ""how do I handle this situation."" It's basically an extension of my brain at this point.

But there's always been this frustrating gap: I get amazing advice, close the app, and then... forget half of it. No tracking, no follow-through, no accountability. Just me and my brain trying to remember what the AI suggested last week.

**So I spent 6 months building Maxi** \- an AI life coach that bridges that gap.

**What makes it different from ChatGPT/Claude:**

* **Persistent memory** \- Remembers your goals, challenges, and context across every conversation
* **Built-in tracking** \- Create habits and goals directly in chat, track progress without switching apps
* **Proactive accountability** \- Sends personalized check-ins: ""How is that daily marketing activity for your SaaS going?""
* **Customizable personality** \- Supportive, tough love, or anywhere in between (built this because I realized one coaching style doesn't work for everyone and it's also tins of fun to play around with custom communication styles)

**Example of how it actually works:**

You: ""I want to get healthier but I'm overwhelmed""   
Maxi: *suggests 2-3 specific habits tailored to your life*   
You: *track them right in chat, no separate app*   
Next week: Maxi remembers your stress patterns and asks how the habits are helping

**The journey was... longer than I expected:**

Started as a web app (I'm a web dev with 20 years experience). Realized an AI assistant needs to live in your pocket, not your browser. Rebuilt it in React Native/Expo, spent weeks making the chat feel as smooth as ChatGPT/Claude.

Navigated App Store approval, implemented RevenueCat for subscriptions, built push notifications that don't feel annoying. Launched it because I needed it - turns out other overthinkers do too.

**Pricing:** Freemium (limited messages/goals/habits free), Unlimited from €6.99/month

Just went live in the App Store yesterday. Excited to finally ship something I've been working on for so long. Probably over-engineered - definitely not in the ""ship in a weekend"" bucket.

Would love feedback from fellow builders - especially if you're also the kind of person who asks AI for life advice and then struggles to actually execute.

Passion for cooking/educational side project.,"I have always really enjoyed cooking, learning new techniques and recipes. I would say that I am very much higher than average in these skill sets.  I am looking for something to not only be a side project, but potentially transition into more full time as it builds.  I know that catering and kitchens in general are cut throat and the margins are horrible, but I'm thinking about from an educational perspective.  

  
What about attempting to hit a demographic for people who genuinely want to learn, but figuring out a way to set myself aside from the millions of other content creators.  I'm thinking something along the lines of in person group meals.  Using a simple form to fill out for any dietary restrictions, any specific inquiries (If they want to learn a specific recipe).  Providing details, (shopping list, list of all needed tools, recipe(s)). And then a contact slot for a single blocked off time at a later point.  



\- Show the step by step process

\- Perform in front

\- Teach them how to re-produce a specific recipe

\- Be a safety net as needed for a blocked off time at a later date





I'm sure that this is a bit far fetched, but I feel like there are people out there that want to learn how to cook, and not even in a grand scale.  Any thoughts on this idea ?

I built my own live sports scoreboard app (ad-free) — looking for testers,"Hey everyone I’ve been building my own **live sports scoreboard web app** from scratch and I’m finally ready for a small test run.

It’s called **CaveCast**, and it shows:

* Live scores
* Odds (DraftKings via TheOddsAPI)
* A scrolling ticker
* Multi-league support (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, NCAAF, NCAAM)
* An ad-free interface that works on phone, computer, or TV

I’m a **beginner / indie developer**, so this is still very much a work-in-progress. I’m putting it live for **24 hours** to get some feedback, unless something breaks horribly and I have to shut it down earlier .

# Access Code (required):

**Reddit2025**

# 🔗 Link:

[https://cavecast.app](https://cavecast.app)

# What I need from testers:

If you try it out, let me know:

* Any bugs
* Anything that doesn’t load correctly
* Confusing UI
* Missing features
* Suggestions for improvements
* What you like or don’t like

Even small feedback helps a ton. I’m building this myself and learning as I go, so real-world usage matters.

# Why I built it:

I wanted a clean, fast scoreboard without ads, autoplay videos, or clutter. But hosting + API usage costs money, so I’m trying to see if this is something people would actually use.

# Notes:

* Works best if you “Add to Home Screen” on iPhone/Android
* There’s a TV Mode for wall-mounted displays
* Odds history charts are in progress
* If it crashes, loads slowly, or something feels off, please tell me!

Thanks for taking a look I appreciate any feedback.

ProofQR - a blockchain-based QR code verification system [looking for feedback],"Good afternoon Reddit. I wanted something to work on over the weekend and wanted to dive into Web3 and also do stuff involving QR code generation (not really sure why just figured it might be an untapped market). After doing some looking online and asking ChatGPT what was needed in the world of Web3 it came up with a QR code based verification system for blockchain items and content. I spent some time researching the concept then started building with Next.js. The photos you see are the result of a few days of work (the back end and logic was 90% done by me with 10% Claude debugging. The design was all AI as I have the artistic talent of a cheeseburger). This is also working using the testnet for now as I do not want to lose funds testing.

So here is how it works currently: 

Step 1: You sign in with you wallet (this is not stored anywhere and you will have to sign in each time)  
Step 2: Enter any data you want to have recorded on the ETH blockchain (my example is a url)  
Step 3: Click generate and confirm the transaction  
Step 4: wait a few seconds. I find most QR codes generate in under 30 seconds  
Step 5: Save your QR code

To validate, simply point your phone camera at the QR code and scan it. This will open up the validation page and show you if the QR code is valid or not. It will also show how many times the code has been scanned and the Etherscan link

Why is this necessary? Traditional QR codes can be easily copied or faked. If someone counterfeits your product, they can just copy the QR code. There's no way to prove which one is authentic. ProofQR provides a way to make sure your data is secure and protected on the ETH blockchain.

What I need from you is feedback. I want ideas on how to make this better and potential additions to add. Any and all feedback is wanted. 

Thank you for viewing my post. Stay tuned for future updates!",RobertTAS,1pbrb1g,SideProject,01-12-2025,22:41:38,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pbrb1g
"Seeking early investors and feedback for a real-time “see-anywhere-live” streaming platform (pre-MVP, high-potential)","Hey everyone, I’m working on a startup that has received a surprising amount of positive validation from Reddit, Discord communities, and direct user conversations. I’m now looking for early-stage investors who understand zero-to-one experimentation and are open to bold consumer-tech ideas.

The concept is simple: a platform where anyone can request a live, real-time view of any place in the world, and someone who is physically there can stream it instantly. If a user wants to see snowfall in New York at this exact moment, or wants to experience the current mood in Tokyo’s Shibuya Crossing, or wants a live walk-through of Dubai Marina, a food street in Istanbul, or even the vibe around an F1 event, they can request it and get a human-powered on-demand live stream. It isn’t like Snap Map because Snap is passive and not real-time on request. It isn’t like Twitch because Twitch is scheduled by creators, not driven by instant viewer requests. And it isn’t a static webcam. This is live, on-demand, interactive, human-powered presence.

From all the conversations and threads so far, people have shown genuine curiosity and willingness to try the platform for entertainment, travel planning, city vibes, cultural exploration, or simply to see what life looks like in another place right now. Streamers have said they would participate if paid per request, and many users love the idea of immediacy. Travelers said they’d use it to check vibes before booking a trip. Engineers and founders have surfaced serious concerns about privacy, real-time misuse, and face-recognition risks, and I’ve already drafted mitigation strategies such as delays, blur-by-default modes, and non-downloadable, non-scrapable streams.

The business model includes pay-per-minute or pay-per-request live views, optional tipping, subscriptions for high-demand locations, sponsored city pages, and tiered revenue for streamers. The unit economics make sense because requests can be micro-priced and the app scales like a marketplace, not a content platform.

I’ve already prepared a detailed roadmap for the pre-MVP and MVP stages, user and streamer acquisition strategies, early architecture planning, privacy safeguards, and a foundational blueprint that covers market size, risks, mitigations, and execution. I also have a landing page draft and a structured pitch deck outline. As a student building this from scratch with no upfront capital, I’m focused entirely on smart, lean execution and community-driven early traction.

I am looking for early angels who enjoy consumer tech, live media, entertainment, or marketplace platforms. Small ticket sizes are welcome, including micro-angels who like early experiments. I’m offering full transparency, monthly progress updates, and early investor equity. Commitment on my end is full-time dedication. I believe this can grow into a global real-time entertainment platform, and the early feedback already shows people want to try it for the novelty and the experience.

If you’re an investor or know someone who invests in zero-to-one consumer products, feel free to DM me or comment. I can share the pitch document, roadmap, architecture, and future plans in detail. Happy to talk further.",Strange-Web-251,1pbrahs,SideProject,01-12-2025,22:41:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pbrahs/seeking_early_investors_and_feedback_for_a/
"Revel: a fully open-source, enterprise-grade Event Management and Ticketing platform tailored to Communities","A few years ago, I developed a small prototype to manage the events I was organizing.

This year, I decided to re-write it from scratch, and do things properly, even better than I get to do when working for other companies.

So I built Revel: a fully open-source, self-hostable, enterprise-grade Event Management and Ticketing platform tailored to Communities that value privacy, control and transparency.

**In a nutshell:**

Revel was born to solve a problem: organize small to medium events without much overhead. Think having an overview of RSVPs and dietary preferences of event with 20-80 participants.

Maybe you want to host exclusive, ticketed events just for the members of your organization and/or vet participants via questionnaires. Revel's got you.

You can control visibility of and eligibility to your events with ease, share invitation links and so on.

You can also manage payments offline if you don't want to bother connecting with Stripe. Revel helps you issue and keep track of everything.

"I built an open-source CLI that compresses entire React/TS projects into AI-friendly, token efficient context bundles","Hi everyone!  
I’ve been working on a tool called LogicStamp: an open-source CLI that scans a React/TypeScript/Next.js codebase and turns it into a set of structured context.json bundles that an LLM can actually understand.  
Current version: v0.2.6



# 🔍 What LogicStamp captures

* Component contracts (props, hooks, state, exports)
* Component hierarchy & dependency graph
* External imports + circular deps
* Behavior patterns (navigation, data fetching, event handlers)
* JSDoc/comments → summarized descriptions
* Next.js-aware routing, layouts, client/server components

Everything is organized per folder, and a single context\_main.json ties the whole repo together with indexes and token estimates.



# 💡 Why I built it

Sending full source files to an LLM is expensive and often pointless: the model mainly needs the structure, relationships, and behavior of your project.

LogicStamp gives the LLM that structural map with 60–70% fewer tokens, while keeping enough detail for debugging, refactoring, and reasoning.



# 🎨 Style Metadata (new!)

I also added an optional --include-style flag that extracts:

* Tailwind / SCSS / CSS Modules patterns
* Layout hints & animation markers
* Early support for Material UI, Shadcn UI, and Radix UI

This makes the tool more visual (great for UI-aware LLM tasks) and still gives around \~30% token savings vs raw source.

"I built a tiny outfit-finder web app using the eBay API, very early and very rough, would love feedback","Hey everyone,

I’ve been working nights on a small side project: a simple web tool that helps you build outfits (tops + bottoms + shoes + accessories) using real eBay listings. It tries to mix different “vibes” (streetwear, minimalist, vintage, Y2K, etc.) and filter by size/color so the results actually fit you.

To be honest, it’s super early, missing tons of features, and the search logic is still kind of dumb in places. But it’s been fun to build, and I’d really appreciate any feedback from people who do side projects too:

* Does the UI feel intuitive or confusing?
* Are the search results even useful?
* Any obvious bugs I should fix first?
* Anything you'd personally love to add if it were your project?

I built a visual day planner that shows the 6 hours you’re losing to scrolling,"Hey fellow builders! It’s me again ❤️

Month ago i made DayZen because I kept wondering where my day went.

Your whole day = one circular ring. Everything visible at once. No scrolling, no lying to yourself about time.

What it does:
	•	Syncs with your existing calendar
	•	Finds open slots for quick tasks automatically
	•	Drag & drop scheduling in seconds
	•	Shows when you’re actually full vs. fooling yourself

Since I hate all the signups and emails its privacy-first:
	•	No account required
	•	No sign-ups
	•	All data stays local on your device
	•	Zero tracking
	•	Just open it and it works

Fixxed my own problem with my programming skills. Might solved yours too,"Hey everyone,

I kept getting frustrated with AI chats (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.). Long conversations turn into this giant, linear wall of text where ideas disappear and you can’t track anything anymore. And when you hit message limits or want to switch to another model? You have to manually copy-paste context like it’s 2010.

So as a dev/student, I built aiTree to fix exactly these problems.

The core idea:
👉 Visualize your conversations as a branching map — a tree that organizes every thread of thought automatically instead of dumping everything into one endless chat.

Features:
- visualise chat int tree with branches 
- export context  into another ai chats
- export chat branch in pdf 
- quick search your chats 

Would love your feedback on https://www.aitree.app",elion_shahini,1pbq7q6,SideProject,01-12-2025,21:58:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pbq7q6/fixxed_my_own_problem_with_my_programming_skills/

"I’m new to n8n and built a ""Pocket Chef"" in Telegram because my toddler leaves me no time to think. Feedback wanted!","Hi everyone! I've been building with **n8n** for a short time, and I wanted to share my latest project to get your feedback/ideas for a V3.

I call it **""My Pocket Chef""**. It lives in Telegram and helps me manage my grocery list and dinner ideas.

**How it works (Simple & Manual):** It’s not fully automated magic; it relies on simple commands because I like having control:

1. **Get Ideas:** I type *""Recipe for \[ingredients\]""* (e.g., ""Recipe for chicken and veggies""), and it instantly suggests a recipe with steps.
2. **Add Items:** If I’m missing something (e.g., ""Eggs"", ""Red pepper""), I type it, and it adds it to my list automatically.
3. **Reset:** The command *""Clear list""* wipes everything clean for the next week.

**The ""Why"":** As a mum to a toddler, I turn to this bot when my brain is fried, I have zero ideas, or I'm just short on time. It helps me improvise with what I have or plan the week while building the shopping list on the go.

**I’d love your suggestions for improvements:** For example: Do you think adding **Voice Commands** (sending audio notes instead of typing) would be too hard to implement?

**The Workflow / Template:** I’ve shared the template in my profile/comments for anyone who wants to build it or use it.

* **The only downside?** The PDF guide is in **Spanish** 🇪🇸 (I'm from Spain!).
* **But...** for n8n users, the logic/nodes are universal, so it shouldn't be a problem to understand.",pazautomatizada,1pbq1v1,SideProject,01-12-2025,21:52:21,https://i.redd.it/5pprb1down4g1.png

Building PaidUp: never forget to get paid back by friends (100 beta spots),"Hey everyone,

I’m solo-building PaidUp, a free app that auto-detects when you front a group tab (dinner, trip, bar, golf round etc.) and sends the split reminder(s) / requests for you in one tap.

The problem I'm looking to solve is there have been so many times I've ""fronted"" the group tab, with the expectation that we'll settle up on Venmo later. I don't want to know how much money I've lost by forgetting to send requests, or when I do catch it, its 2 weeks later and now its an awkward message ""Heyy..remember that dinner last month..?""

I'm looking for **100 beta testers** who go out with friends a lot.  
Beta drops end of December (iOS + Android TestFlight).  
First 100 get:  
• Lifetime free  
• **$25 Amazon gift card** when you split 3 real expenses

Please comment if you're interested in being an ""early adopter"" or DM me and I’ll add you to the list. All I need is your email and you can access the beta. I'll be sending out an email towards the end of the month before it goes live

How I used GitHub Copilot to build a PDF engine that is 10x faster (and it's free),"**The ""Why"": Dealing with the PDF Nightmare** A few months ago, I was assigned a task that every developer dreads: finding a library to generate PDFs programmatically.

The landscape was bleak.

* **UniPDF:** Great, but costly.
* **JasperReports:** Flashbacks to 2022 Java nightmares. Slow and bloated.
* **Aspose:** I tried the free version. It took **2-5 seconds** just to generate 4 simple fields.

Everything was either ""enterprisey"" expensive ($2k-$4k/year) or painfully slow. I needed something fast, free, and Go-based. It didn't exist. So, I decided to build it.

**The ""How"": Copilot as my Co-Founder** I’m not a PDF spec expert, but I was curious. I opened a raw PDF file in a text editor and saw the patterns—`/v`, encoded data, objects. It looked like chaos, but structured chaos.

I turned to **GitHub Copilot** and ChatGPT:

1. I fed it the raw structure and asked, *""How would I represent this object structure in Go?""*
2. I noticed AI was leaning toward reportlab-style logic, so I pivoted. I asked it to help me scaffold a suite similar to Jasper but lightweight.
3. **The Breakthrough:** I asked Copilot to generate a single-file sample code that writes these raw PDF bytes. It worked.

From there, it was just 1-2 hours a night of refactoring. Copilot handled the boilerplate while I focused on the architecture. Within \~1 month, I had v1. Now, v2 is live.

**The Result: GoPdfSuit** The goal was to kill the pain of CSS alignment. No more fighting to center text.

* **Language Agnostic:** It runs as an HTTP service. You send JSON, you get a PDF.
* **Visual Editor:** Drag, drop, design your template.
* **Performance:**
   * **iText (Free):** \~400ms+
   * **GoPdfSuit:** \~40ms (Avg)
   * That is roughly **10x faster**.

**What’s New in v2.0.0 (The Polish)** I just dropped v2.0.0, which was a massive overhaul:

* **Frontend Rewrite:** Migrated from vanilla JS to **React**. Now features a polished 3-column layout.
* **New Previewer:** Added Zoom, Rotate, and Fullscreen controls (because users need to see what they are printing).
* **New Engine:** Swapped WKHTML for `gochromepdf` and added an official **Docker image** for easy deployment.
* **AcroForms:** Native support for interactive Radio Buttons, Checkboxes, and Text Inputs.
* **Advanced Tables:** You can now drag-and-drop resize rows/cols and embed **images directly into table cells**.

**TL;DR:** I got tired of slow/expensive PDF libraries, used Copilot to decipher the PDF spec, and built a drag-and-drop, JSON-based PDF generator that runs in microseconds.

Implement Community Building Strategy for Investor Engagement,"We just rolled out a new strategy in our CRM aimed at building an actual community of investors—not just blasting ads or doing cold outreach.

Instead of relying on short-term tactics, the idea is to bring together people who want to follow our company over time, stay informed, and potentially participate in multiple raises down the road.

🔥 What This Strategy Focuses On

• Building a real investor ecosystem

The goal is long-term engagement, not one-off transactions. We’re creating a space where investors can follow updates, interact, and stay plugged into what we’re building.

• Understanding the true cost of fundraising channels

We broke down the cost differences between running paid ads (Facebook, Meta, etc.), doing cold outreach, and building an owned community. Spoiler: community-building is slower, but the long-term ROI looks a lot stronger.

• Owning our own data

Instead of letting third-party platforms keep all the value, we’re structuring everything so we retain the relationships and insights inside our CRM—email, engagement behavior, investor intent, etc.

• Thinking beyond the immediate raise

This approach is built to support future rounds. The idea is: build once, nurture continuously, and re-activate efficiently when new campaigns launch.

💡 Assumptions We’re Working With

Community building takes more upfront time and effort.

Investors engage more deeply when they feel connected—not just targeted by ads.

Long-term control of our own data is essential if we want to scale fundraising sustainably.

📊 How We’re Testing All This

We’re running an A/B structure inside the CRM:

Tracking engagement metrics from community-focused outreach.

Comparing conversion rates between community members and cold/paid leads.

Collecting feedback directly from investors on how they feel about the community experience vs traditional funnels.

Made heat-mold insoles for 25 instead of 400 custom orthotics. Roast my site before I launch.,"Quick context: Custom orthotics cost $400 and take 3 weeks. You get beige foam that looks like it belongs in a nursing home.



I spent the last year making insoles that heat-mold to your feet at home. 10 minutes in the oven, 60 seconds standing in them, done. Custom fit. $25.



Oh, and they actually look like something you'd want people to see. Graphic designs. Sneaker culture vibes. Not medical device energy.



Launching January 1st with 500 units across 3 designs. Marketing budget is basically $0 so I'm doing this the hard way — organic content, word of mouth, and begging strangers on Reddit for feedback.

First scan on my projects folder: 28GB+ of reclaimable space from projects I haven't touched in months.

I’m building a “universal feed” for creators (Twitter + LinkedIn + IG + YouTube) – is this actually a good idea or just my personal itch?,"Hey folks,

I’ve been sitting on this idea for a bit and finally decided to build it, but before I go too deep I’d love some honest feedback/roasting from people here who think about startups more rationally than “this annoys me so I’ll code it.” 😅

If you want to try the MVP when it’s ready, I’ve put up a tiny waitlist here: [https://influencerhub.app/#join-beta](https://influencerhub.app/#join-beta)

The pain:

My mornings look like this:

* Open X to check a few builders/founders → get hijacked by the “For You” feed.
* Open LinkedIn for 2 people’s posts → end up in corporate cringe.
* Open YouTube to see 1 creator’s new video → recommended rabbit hole.
* Open Instagram “just for a sec” → RIP 20 minutes.

I’m following \~15–20 creators I genuinely care about, but it feels like I’m wrestling 5 different casinos just to see what they posted. Half the time I still miss stuff because the algorithms decide I “need” something else.

What I actually want is boring:

* One place.
* Chronological.
* Only people I chose.
* Searchable.
* No “because you watched X…” bullshit.

So I’m building it.

The idea:

A “universal feed” for creators you follow across:

* Twitter/X
* LinkedIn
* Instagram
* YouTube

Core v1 (2‑week MVP scope):

* Paste a profile link or a/handle → the app detects the platform and starts pulling their public posts.
* Everything goes into one unified, chronological feed.
* Basic filters by person / platform / tag.
* Search across all posts from all creators.
* Bookmark posts and add your own notes.

Later:

* AI summaries for long-form stuff so you can skim before diving in.

Think: not another social network, not another analytics tool, just a “reader” for the people you actually follow.

Why I think it might work (or at least be worth testing):

* Creators are more multi-platform than ever, but followers are stuck doing manual tab-hopping.
* Existing tools (Feedly, RSS readers, etc.) are great for blogs/news but feel clunky for social feeds.
* Social apps are optimized for their goals (engagement), not mine (consume specific people intentionally).

But I’m obviously biased, so here’s where I’d love input.

What I want your help with:

1. Is this a real problem or am I just “over‑optimizing my life” and founder‑braining myself into a corner?
2. From a product perspective, what would be the ONE killer thing that makes this worth using over just:

* Twitter Lists
* YouTube “Subscriptions” tab
* “Just using Feedly/RSS”

Cross‑platform search?  
AI summaries?  
Email digests instead of another app?  
Some kind of “inbox zero for creators” view?

1. From a business POV, do you see this as:

* A nice little paid tool for power users ($5–10/mo)?
* A free/cheap utility that should monetize via something else (affiliate, B2B, etc.)?
* A terrible business but an okay personal tool?

What obvious “oh shit, X will kill this instantly” thing am I missing?

* API fragility?
* Hard to differentiate from existing tools?
* Distribution nightmare?
* “People don’t actually want to fix this, they enjoy doomscrolling”?

Where it’s at:

I’m scoping a 2‑week MVP:

* First integrations: Twitter + LinkedIn, then Youtube/IG if there’s demand.
* Web first, mobile‑friendly; native apps later if it doesn’t flop.

I’m planning to bring in a small group of early users who are genuinely annoyed by feed fragmentation and want to co‑shape the product. I’m not trying to “launch” at you; I’m trying to sanity‑check if this is worth pursuing as a real startup vs a weekend project.

If this sounds like something you’d actually use (or tear apart), I’d love:

* Your honest take in the comments (brutal is fine, “this is dumb because X” is super helpful).

How do you guys handle the 'marketing' part? I've finished my project but I'm completely lost now...,"Hey everyone

I've just hit that weird phase after a year of coding: the project is ""done,"" but now I have no idea how to get actual people to see it.

I built a PWA shopping list app. I was proud of the tech, so I threw some money at Google Ads, hoping for some feedback. The result? A bunch of traffic that bounces in 3 seconds. It feels like I just paid for bots to visit my homepage once. It's pretty demoralizing.

Then, I tried making some YouTube Shorts to show off the AI features. They also got almost no views. I'm not a video editor, and honestly, they probably suck. Is the format just all wrong?

[https://youtube.com/shorts/AkqVClqbL\_U](https://youtube.com/shorts/AkqVClqbL_U)

I'm trying to figure out if the problem is my ad strategy or if the landing page itself just isn't working. For context, this is the project I'm talking about: [listmind.app](https://listmind.app/)

My question for you all is, what actually worked for you to get your first real users?

Did you have success with Product Hunt? Posting on other subreddits? Content marketing? I'm feeling a bit like I've hit a wall and would appreciate any advice from those who've been through this.

This is my first post, so apologies if this isn’t the right place.

I’ve spent the last year studying mobile development and i've just built a beta for a new app called Trippi. It’s a walking tour app where users can:

* Follow suggested tours around your chosen city
* Use AI-generated tours based on your selected location
* Share your experiences by creating posts and uploading images after completing tours
* Follow friends, get followers, and customize your profile

I’m looking for honest feedback on:

* Does the app make sense?
* Would you actually use it?
* What features feel missing or confusing?

If you would be open to beta testing this app, send me a direct message with your email registered to your google play account, and i will invite you to the closed beta testing round.

I built a waitlist tool with viral mechanics,"Sooo… I built a waitlist tool with viral mechanics (because I was tired of paying $79/mo for basic features)

**Background:** I'm an indie hacker who's launched a few products. Every time I needed a waitlist, the tools were either:
- Expensive ($79-199/mo)
- Missing features (no API, no webhooks)
- Cluttered with features I didn't need

So I built ReferralLoop.

**What makes it different:**

1. **Actual viral mechanics** - People move UP in line by referring friends. Not just ""share to get updates"" - actual position movement. This created 3x more referrals in my testing.

2. **Developer-friendly** - Full REST API, webhooks, Zapier integration. Every competitor either has no API or charges $200+/mo for it.

3. **Affordable** - Free tier that's actually useful (100 signups). Paid plans start at $29/mo with API access included.

**Features:**
- Beautiful public waitlist pages
- Automatic referral tracking
- Position advancement based on referrals
- Email notifications
- CSV export
- Analytics dashboard
- API + webhooks
- Zapier (connect to 5,000+ apps)

**Tech:** Next.js, Supabase, TypeScript, Tailwind

**Pricing:**
- Free: 100 signups, 1 waitlist
- Starter ($29): 1K signups, API access
- Growth ($99): 10K signups + custom domains
- Pro ($199): Unlimited everything

**Try it:** https://referralloop.dev

Happy to answer questions! Also open to feedback - what features would make you use this over alternatives?

"Expanding my portfolio: I built a URL Shortener with Vue, Redis and Cloudflare Workers. Looking for feedback!","Hey everyone, first post here!

This week, I decided to expand my portfolio by deploying a few new projects. For the last two days, I’ve been building an URL shortener. Beyond basic shortening, I wanted to challenge myself to include utility features like:

* **Analytics Dashboard**
* **QR Code Generation**
* **Password Protection**
* **Custom Links**
* **UTM Parameters Builder**
* **Link Expiration Dates**

**The Tech Stack:**

* **Frontend:** Vue 3 + Vite
* **Backend:** Cloudflare Workers (using itty-router)
* **Database:** Drizzle ORM
* **Auth:** Better Auth
* **Caching:** Redis

I just launched an AI app that turns a single prompt into a full short video. Early numbers + struggles + screenshots inside; I would love feedback from other builders.,"https://preview.redd.it/bid0yb6o5n4g1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=b32f2b9523772d551bf064f64d8167f00d1d81d1

I’ve been working on a strange idea for months:  
What if you could type one prompt… and your phone generates a complete short video with images, narration, subtitles, and everything?  
  
  
Not a template.    
Not a slideshow.    
A real, AI-generated short video in about 40-60 seconds.  
  
  
Last week, I finally launched it on the App Store.    
Here are the early numbers (raw and a bit embarrassing):  
  
  
Traffic  
 2.24K impressions    
 1.53K product page views    
 Conversion rate: 3.78% (yeah… needs help)    
  
  
Installs  
 52 total    
 Mostly from App Store search (50%)    
 Top countries: India & US (11 each)    
  
  
Revenue  
 $0 so far    
 Haven’t set up the paywall yet; rookie mistake    
  
  
Usage  
 3.29 sessions per device    
 Only 1 crash reported    
 Retention = “Not enough data yet”    
  
  
The wild part?    
People who try generating a video actually spend time exploring the output. There’s some spark there. I just don’t know how to shape it yet.  
  
  
This is what the app does:  
  
 You enter a prompt    
 It generates a short story    
 Creates all the images    
 Adds AI voiceover    
 Auto subtitles    
 Assembles everything into a full video    
 Lets you download or share instantly    
  
  
Basically, it’s “AI video creation without touching a timeline.”  
  
  
I’m trying to grow this into a real product, not just a toy. My goal is $10k MRR within a few months if I can find the right funnel.  
  
  
So I have a few questions for other side-project builders:  
  
  
1. What would make you actually use an app like this?    
2. Should I focus on TikTok/Reels for growth or double down on ASO?    
3. Any tips on creating a paywall that doesn’t send everyone running?    
4. Is a 3-4% conversion rate normal for early AI apps, or way too low?    
  
  
I’m open to any feedback, even brutal honesty.

I’ve been working on this project for months and finally submitted my project to Kickstarter for review today. It’s called drift, a simple handcrafted oak block with an NFC chip inside that pairs with the drift app I made. When you tap your phone on it, it automatically activates a preset or automation you’ve created (like blocking distracting apps, turning on focus mode, starting a work routine, etc).

Here is my (beautiful) prototype. I've been using it and loving it so far!

The motivation came from two places: 

1. There are businesses selling tools like this for $60 but they just look like ugly plastic.

2. My own struggle with staying focused. I always lose hours to scrolling every week

I wanted something physical that looked great, something that makes the habit change feel real rather than just another app.

* Finds which month you went hardest

Got fed up with signature sheets so I built a simple attendance service,"Hey everyone,

After attending lots of lectures and conferences, I realized most attendance taking methods fall into two problems:

They take forever to complete (e.g., passing around a signature sheet)

They can be easily faked (e.g., sharing a simple QR code with a friend)

So I built a small service that tries to fix both issues.
My idea was to keep the speed of QR scanning but add a location check, so attendance is only valid if you’re actually near the event.

I made a simple program to generate beautiful vortex graphs inspired by the Tesla 3‑6‑9 pattern,"Hi everyone!

I wanted to share a small fun project that I worked on before and just published on GitHub: **PyVortex**.

It’s a Python program that generates hypnotic vortex patterns using **Turtle graphics**, inspired by the famous “Tesla 3‑6‑9” idea (though the math behind it is mostly pseudoscience).

You can customize:

* The number of points on the circle (`base`)
* The multiplication factor (`multiplier`)
* The circle radius
* Colors, dots, and number labels

It’s beginner-friendly, fun to experiment with, and makes some pretty interesting visuals.

  
The project is still a work in progress, so feedback is very welcome! Suggestions for new features, improvements, or just interesting patterns you discover are all appreciated.

Got fed up with signature sheets so I built a simple attendance service,"Hey everyone,

After attending lots of lectures and conferences, I realized most attendance taking methods fall into two problems:

They take forever to complete (e.g., passing around a signature sheet)

They can be easily faked (e.g., sharing a simple QR code with a friend)

So I built a small service that tries to fix both issues.  
My idea was to keep the speed of QR scanning but add a location check, so attendance is only valid if you’re actually near the event.

It’s still early stage, but I’ve put together a website and a fully functional demo.  
The demo is free and doesn’t require any signup

 If anyone wants to try it out, I’d really appreciate your feedback!

"I got tired of sounding like ChatGPT on Twitter, so I built a tool to train AI on my actual writing style.","Hey everyone,

Like many of you, I'm trying to build a personal brand to support my main business. But honestly? Engaging on X (Twitter) and LinkedIn is a massive time sink.

I tried using standard AI tools to speed it up, but the replies always sounded... soulless. It was obvious it wasn't me. It used too many emojis or words I'd never say.

So, I spent the last few months building a browser extension called **PostOwl**.

The main difference is that it lets you ""train"" models on your previous posts. It basically creates a doppelgänger of your writing style so you don't have to spend 15 minutes editing every AI suggestion. It also handles scheduling and image editing so I don't have to tab-switch constantly.

There's a free tier (no credit card needed) if anyone wants to roast it or give it a spin. I'm looking for honest feedback on whether the ""voice matching"" feels accurate to you.

Built a small tool that shows ads only while AI is “thinking” — does this feel useful to devs?,"
Hey folks,
I’m testing a simple idea and I’d love honest feedback before I go deeper.

I use AI tools a lot for coding, and something clicked recently:

We always stare at a “Thinking…” spinner for 2–4 seconds anyway.
What if that time paid for the AI usage?

So I built a concept called Waitless AI — a plugin idea where:
	•	Ads show only while the AI is processing
	•	Never while typing or reading code
	•	No video, no pop-ups, no noise
	•	The moment the AI responds → ad disappears
	•	The ad revenue subsidizes token cost

Built a tool to convert PDF bank statements into CSVs (feedback welcome),"Hey everyone — I built a small web tool that converts bank statement PDFs into CSVs/sheets for Excel / QuickBooks.

I originally made it for a contractor buddy because his bank wouldn't let him export 300 pages of transaction history, nor link it via connector from his bank.

Tried other tools with many conversion issues, especially because the scan was low quality, so I built this instead.

You might say ChatGPT would be sufficient for this task, but it can't always be trusted to grab every transaction, as it isn't designed to do that, at least not out of the box. Plus, it brings up security concerns when statements are used to train LLMs.

Two things that might matter to small business owners or accountants:  
• It works even if your statement is scanned / messy as it has an OCR feature.  
• AI is **optional** — if you're concerned about uploading financial info to an LLM, you can process files without AI enabled. But if your statement doesn't process well without it, try it!

It supports multi-page statements, weird bank formats, and produces a plain CSV you can import into Quickbooks, Xero, Excel, etc.

I built a 500-prompt system after all my Reels/Tik Tok videos kept flopping - would love feedback before I iterate further.,"Hey everyone 👋

For the last 2 months I’ve been working on something that started from my own frustration — I make short-form content (Reels/TikTok/Shorts), and I noticed that 90% of my ideas died because the hooks weren’t strong enough.

So I started collecting, testing, rewriting, and organizing every high-impact prompt that consistently helped me create better hooks, stories, POV scripts, and trend-remix content.

Over time, it accidentally grew into a full 500-prompt system.

I now use it for:

• viral hooks  
• storytelling  
• trend-based scripts  
• relatable content  
• meme-style ideas  
• retention-focused video openings  

To give something useful upfront, here are 5 sample prompts that performed best for me:

1. Curiosity Hook – “Explain a surprising truth about [your niche] in one sentence that stops scrolling.”

2. Relatable POV Script – “Write a 10-sec POV story about [situation], ending with a twist that makes people comment.”

3. Myth-Breaker Intro – “Give me a bold opening line that challenges a common belief about [topic].”

4. Trend Remix – “Turn this trending audio [paste] into a short, funny, niche-specific skit.”

5. Emotional Close – “Write a short script that hits emotionally and ends with a question that forces reflection.”

I’m still improving this system — reorganizing categories, refining prompt wording, and adding new use-cases.

Would love honest feedback from this community:

Black Friday find: AI tool that generates professional photos of you in seconds,"Indie hackers, listen up.

We all know we should be posting more. Building in public. Showing our faces. Being ""authentic.""

But here's my dirty secret: I wasn't posting because I didn't have photos.

Sounds dumb, right? But it's true.

I'd write updates about my product, get to the image part, and just... not post.

Then I grabbed Looktara on RocketHub's Black Friday sale.

Upload 30 photos → AI trains on your face → generates professional photos on demand.

Type: ""me in a hoodie working at a desk"" → boom, photo in 5 seconds.

Why this matters for builders:

Content consistency is everything when you're building in public.

But photoshoots are expensive ($300-500) and time-consuming (half a day minimum).

This removes that friction completely.

I've generated 25 photos in the past 3 hours. Different settings, outfits, vibes.

My Twitter, LinkedIn, and Product Hunt profiles finally look active and human.

The deal:

Lifetime access on [RocketHub](https://www.rockethub.com/deal/looktara) during Black Friday.

One-time payment. Unlimited photos. Forever.

For the price of one photoshoot, you get infinite photos whenever you need them.

If you're bootstrapping and need to look professional without burning cash on photographers... this is it.

how i ship side projects without burning weekends anymore,"i used to burn every weekend coding. not even building features, just setting up boilerplate, prompting ai tools over and over, switching between codex and claude and cursor trying to get something coherent out. 

easily 200-300 hours to ship anything meaningful. my side projects were dying in ""almost done"" purgatory. family time? what's that.

then i figured out a workflow that changed everything.

instead of prompting → waiting → re-prompting → fixing → repeat... i write one spec file and let agents handle the rest autonomously. planning, architecture, implementation, testing.. all orchestrated without me babysitting.

\*\*first test:\*\* a landing page. wrote the spec, kicked it off, went to grab dinner with family. came back to 4,500 lines of production code. react 18, typescript, tailwind with custom theme tokens, vite, playwright e2e tests, vercel deployment ready. not a skeleton.. actual working code.

\*\*second test:\*\* went bigger. 7 microservices for a saas idea i'd been sitting on for months. the result: - \~500 files, 65k lines of code - react frontend, fastapi + nestjs backends, postgres, mongodb, redis - kubernetes configs included - 8 hours of autonomous this one i got it about 80% working.. i did some debugging but actually the result was insane.  

orchestration same project with my old workflow i estimated 200-300 hours minimum. probably would've abandoned it halfway.

"I realized ""just motivational quotes"" aren't enough, so I pivoted my side project into a full ""Productivity Station""","Hi everyone,

I am a frontend developer building [Daily Motivation For You](https://dailymotivationforyou.com/) as a solo side project.

I initially built this because I hated how cluttered most motivation sites were. I wanted a clean, minimalist PWA where I could get a quick mindset boost without the doom-scrolling trap.

However, as I kept building, I realized something: Motivation gets you started, but systems keep you going.

While the deep-dive blog posts I write are crucial for understanding the psychology of discipline (like why we procrastinate), reading is still passive. I wanted to give people a way to take active steps immediately after reading.

So, I decided to evolve the project from a simple ""Quote Blog"" into a functional ""Productivity Station.""

I just shipped a Minimalist [Online Pomodoro Timer](https://dailymotivationforyou.com/tools/pomodoro-timer). I intentionally kept the design very simple and distraction-free because I believe tools shouldn't fight for your attention—they should help you focus.

I want to fill the ""Tools"" section with micro-apps that people actually need to stay disciplined. So what other tools would you use? Maybe an interactive Eisenhower Matrix, a visual Habit Tracker, or a Breathwork tool for anxiety?

And does the site feel too simple or just right?

Looking for a few testers for an SEO content tool (with free access),"Hey everyone — I’m looking for a small group of people (5 - 10) willing to test a tool I’m building. It’s an AI assistant that posts SEO content for ranking websites on Google and ChatGPT (happy to share more about how it works if anyone’s curious).

Before I open it publicly, I’d love to get real-world usage + honest feedback from people who actually run sites.



**What I’m offering**  
Free full access worth $99 during the testing period (no credit card, no upsells).  
This will generate 30 full blogs for your site including images, embedded videos, internal and external links, fully optimized for Google and ChatGPT.



**Who I’m looking for**  
People who have:

• A website with analytics (GA4, Search Console, Plausible, etc.)

• Willingness to give feedback as you use it

• Openness to share some analytics changes (traffic, rankings, impressions — screenshots are totally fine; no full access needed)

• Optional but appreciated: a short testimonial at the end if the tool genuinely helps you



**Why I’m doing this**  
I want to validate real value, find rough edges, and make sure this solves an actual problem before scaling it.

If you're interested, drop a comment or DM me and I’ll send over details + access.  
Thanks!

No links here — happy to DM access so it follows subreddit rules.",One_Administration58,1pbh7n5,SideProject,01-12-2025,16:25:34,https://i.redd.it/k6puihjsbm4g1.png
I spent a year building a new way for people to connect meaningfully and the- and the process changed me.,"A year ago, I went through an inner shift that made me rethink how people actually connect — both personally and professionally.

I kept seeing the same two groups struggle:

• Creators who want to be discovered
• Seekers trying to find the right people but drowning in social media noise

So I built a platform that uses simple role selection + lightweight tools (pitches, clips, posts) to make matches more meaningful and less overwhelming.

Along the way I learned a ton — tech stack decisions, UX mistakes, how to simplify features, and how hard it is to balance “social” with “purpose.”

I'm happy to share anything that might help others building their own projects:
architecture, design choices, what I’d do differently, the emotional side, whatever.

If you're curious about the project or want feedback on your own, I’d love to chat.",Yoganjali,1pbh7ef,SideProject,01-12-2025,16:25:18,https://i.redd.it/wr9gzl6kcm4g1.jpeg

I’m building a voice-first productivity tool that lets you trigger actions on your Mac with fast and accurate speech recognition. No “Hey Siri” every two seconds. No lag. Just speak, yap, and watch your tasks and schedule fall into place.

Right now I’m polishing the speech engine and testing different command flows. It already feels insanely good. I’m managing my personal, work and family calendars through it with zero friction.

i built cursor for growing your personal brand,"for the last few months, i’ve been trying to grow a tiny saas i’m building.

but i don't have a lot of money, so organic is my way to go.

and ""personal brand"", ""building in public"", all of this bs sounds pretty enticing and on platforms like linkedin and x you can just win with text.

but it wasn't as easy as i expected.

i was spending more time on trying to grow on these more than building.

somedays i'd be super active and then disappear for a week.

so i decided to look for tools out there but:

\- no tool catered to both linkedin & x properly

\- they were more of crm, automation kinda so my accounts were at risk and also no one focussed towards founders.

\- the content they generated sounded straight ai.

then i decided to build a tool that solves that.

you basically connect your accounts, tell a bit about yourself, your goals , your products etc. and it helps you write posts that not only performs good but sounds like you too.

along with that it has a complete strategist built in, which analyzes your whole content, metrics, niche, trends and tells you what to do.

and much more....

I've been using it every day.

and within two weeks, i went from 50 to 370 followers and barely spent an hour.

won't drop a link, but here’s a quick video of how it generates a tweet from an idea in like 5 seconds:

I built an iOS keyboard extension that uses Sliders to rewrite text in-place (No Copy-Pasting).,"Hi everyone,

I often use AI to polish emails or text messages—making them sound more professional, or sometimes just funnier. But I absolutely hated this tedious workflow:  
Copy ➡️ ChatGPT ➡️ Paste ➡️ Prompt ➡️ Copy ➡️ Back ➡️ Paste  
I wanted an AI tool that lives directly in the input area where I type. I didn't want another chatbot interface.

So I spent the last month building **KeycoBoard**.  
Instead of typing prompts, you use **5 Sliders** on the keyboard to control how the AI rewrites your text:

* **Length:** From a one-sentence summary to a detailed expansion.
* **Tone:** From ""Internet Meme"" to ""Official Statement"".
* **Depth:** From ""ELI5"" (Simple) to ""Industry Jargon"".
* **Emotion:** From 100% Objective to Dramatic.
* **Emoji:** From clean text to an ""Emoji Bomb"".

You can mix and match these sliders just like using a **Sound Mixing Console**. My goal is to cover most daily rewriting needs with this interaction.

**How it works:**

1. Type in any app (Notes, Mail, iMessage, etc.).
2. Switch to KeycoBoard.
3. Select the text you want to rewrite (or leave it unselected to rewrite the whole text box).
4. Adjust the sliders and hit ""Apply"".
5. The result updates **in-place** instantly.

**I’m looking for some honest feedback:**  
Does this slider-based interaction solve a real pain point for you, or do you prefer typing out specific prompts?

Also, if this sounds like something you’d use, the app is currently in **TestFlight**. I’m looking for ""angel users"" to help me test it out. Let me know in the comments if you want to give it a spin！",Low_Razzmatazz_8832,1pbh2qg,SideProject,01-12-2025,16:20:26,https://v.redd.it/jq8r0qzgbm4g1
I refused to add AI identification to my plant app for months. Here is why I changed my mind (and why I'm betting on Google's new models).,"Hi Reddit,

I’m the indie dev behind an iOS app called PokePlant (a plant care journal).

For a long time, users requested an ""AI Plant ID"" feature, but I kept saying no. I felt that most existing solutions were either inaccurate, too slow, or aggressively paywalled. I didn't want to add a mediocre feature just for the sake of it.

So, what changed?
I’ve been experimenting heavily with the new Google Gemini models during my development process (using Gemini 3 for coding assistance has been a game-changer). But when I tested Gemini 2.5 Flash specifically for image recognition, I was genuinely surprised.

Why Gemini 2.5 Flash?
1. Cost-Efficiency: As an indie dev, API costs are a huge concern. This model offers the best balance of performance and price, allowing me to provide high-quality identification without forcing expensive subscriptions on users just to cover my bills.

2. Accuracy: It surprisingly outperformed some established apps in my tests. My theory is that Google simply has the most massive dataset on the web, which gives it a unique edge when distinguishing between tricky plant varieties.

I decided to quietly ship this feature in today's update. It’s tucked away in the app as a ""helper tool"" rather than the main focus.

If you have some plants nearby, I’d love for you to test its limits.

The App: PokePlant
Tech Stack: SwiftUI + Gemini 2.5 Flash API

(free full membership until December 31, no payment info needed)

The interview runs through voice, so you simply speak your answers as you would in a real call. The system converts everything into a transcript automatically and analyzes how you answered. It looks at clarity, logical structure, whether your response followed STAR or PREP, how concise or rambling you were, your pacing, filler words, and general delivery. It also highlights parts of the answer that could be improved and suggests how to strengthen your examples.

Multi-language support is included as well, so you can practice in English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, French, German, or Spanish. It works well for non-native speakers who want to build confidence, reduce anxiety, or train their delivery before an actual interview.

Thinking About Building a (Micro-)SaaS. Where Do I Start?,"I’ve built two small websites (client-side only, no backend) just to experiment, and it’s been a fun learning experience. I’d like to keep expanding them, but aside from adding small features, blog posts, or doing some marketing, they don’t really need much more work.

So now I’m thinking about stepping into the SaaS world. The issue is that I’m not sure what to build, or even where to start. I’m considering trying a micro-SaaS: something small but useful with a low monthly subscription, mainly so I can learn how the whole process works. I’ve never built anything involving subscriptions or payment plans before, and I feel like a small project would be a good way to get that experience.

"I built a tiny nutrition assistant for my wife, and somehow it grew into a full system","
Hi everyone.
I am a solo developer, and this whole thing started in the most ordinary way.

My wife has struggled for years with the constant mental load around food. Not diet rules, not macros, just the exhausting everyday thoughts like:
""Did I overeat today?""
""Was this healthy enough?""
""Should I track this or leave it?""

I wanted to help her reduce that stress a bit, so I built a tiny helper. At first it was nothing more than a small script that took a photo of a meal and wrote it into a log for her. No ambitions, no project plans, just something quiet for someone I care about.

But then she showed it to a couple of friends. And they showed it to a few more people.
And suddenly I started getting questions and small requests like:
""Could it understand text too?""
""Can it handle voice messages?""
""Can you add summaries?""
""Can it work in other languages?""
""Can it remember the day as a whole?""

I did not plan any of this, but I kept building because it was fun. One piece at a time.

• What it can do now

Still simple, still lightweight, but much bigger than the original idea:

• recognises meals from photos
• understands natural language input
• supports voice messages
• logs meals automatically with timestamps
• creates daily and weekly summaries
• works in multiple languages because friends wanted to use it too
• stays inside a messenger so no one needs another app
• tries to understand context instead of strict commands

• What was challenging

The code was not the hard part.
The hard part was making it work with real human behavior:

• messy photos
• vague meal descriptions
• incomplete information
• unpredictable wording
• different food cultures
•and very little patience from users

Keeping it fast, cheap and stable while doing all that was a challenge on its own.

• Why I am sharing this

I am not trying to promote anything.
I just think it is interesting how a tiny personal script can unexpectedly grow into something meaningful for many people.

I am still building this alone. If anyone wants to talk about the tech side, the problems I ran into or the design choices, I am here.

After months of hard work, I’m thrilled to announce that Ocera is finally ready for you to try!

### What’s Ocera?
Ocera is an AI-powered tool designed specifically for Redditors looking to streamline their posting process. Here’s how it can help you:

- **AI-Powered Post Variations**: Automatically create unique versions of your posts, ensuring you stay active without sounding repetitive.
- **Subreddit Rule Compliance**: Our AI understands the specific rules of each subreddit, formatting your posts to minimize the chances of removals.
- **Scheduled Posting**: Plan and schedule your posts in advance across multiple subreddits, keeping your accounts active even when you’re offline.
- **Reddit-Focused Automation**: Unlike generic social media tools, Ocera is tailored for Reddit, focusing on boosting engagement while ensuring compliance.

I built this tool because I know how challenging it can be to post consistently while adhering to subreddit rules. My goal was to create a solution that makes automation not only efficient but also safe and user-friendly.

I’d love to hear your thoughts or any feedback you might have! If you're interested in trying it out, let me know!

"Built a tool that replaces the ""5 tab workflow"" to a single platform.","Hey folks,

I’ve been working on something that solves a problem I personally struggled with for years — juggling 5 different tools just to send a proposal, follow up, invoice, track payments, and manage clients.

So I built Worklane, a simple workflow automation tool designed for freelancers, agencies, consultants, and service businesses who are tired of duct-taping their operations together.

Instead of switching between Docs + CRM + Invoicing tool + Email + Sheets…
Worklane puts everything into one clean flow:

1) Create & send proposals

2) Auto follow-ups that don’t feel robotic

3) Generate invoices instantly

4) Track payments + chase late ones automatically

5) Manage client pipelines in one place

6) Focus more on real work, not admin work

The idea is simple:
If your deal flow lives in 5 different tabs today, Worklane turns it into 1.

I’m not here to hard-sell — I genuinely want feedback from people who’ve felt this pain.

Added a floating button to Tab Master - now restore sessions from ANY page 🎯✨,"Quick update for Tab Master users (and anyone drowning in tabs 😅)

Just shipped a feature I've been wanting forever:

🎯 **Quick Restore Button**

Here's the magic:
• Enable it in settings (one toggle)
• A small button appears on EVERY page you browse
• Click it = instant access to all your saved sessions
• Restore any session without opening the extension
• Save current tabs right from that button too

Why this matters:

Before: Open extension → find session → restore (3 clicks, context switch)
After: Click button → restore (literally one click, zero friction) ⚡

It's like having your saved sessions in your pocket, ready anytime.

Perfect when you're:
• Deep in research and need to switch contexts 🔬
• Jumping between work and personal browsing 💼→🏠
• ""Wait, where was that tab group I saved?"" 🤔

Combined with everything else Tab Master does:
✅ Auto-categorization (Work, Shopping, Dev, etc.)
✅ Tab suspension (save 60-80% RAM)
✅ Lightning search across everything
✅ Keyboard shortcuts for power users
✅ Full Arabic support
✅ 100% local - no cloud, no tracking

Still completely free. No premium nonsense.

One and only OKLCH color palette generator you need,"Hey everyone!

A while ago I shared my project that lets you generate color palettes and instantly export them as Tailwind or CSS configuration files. I received a lot of feedbacks and since then I have been working even more..

Palettt now fully supports OKLCH. If you're not familiar with OKLCH, here’s a quick rundown:

* It’s a perceptually uniform color model, meaning changes in the values actually look consistent to the human eye.
* It solves many problems that HSL, RGB struggle with ( saturation issues, unpredictable shifts).
* OKLCH is becoming the new standard in modern design systems because it gives you smoother gradients, balanced shades, predictable color ramps, great accessibility

Create and edit colors using full OKLCH controls

"A simple, invisible prompt-storage extension I made to streamline workflow","Hello everyone,

I needed a way to store and access my prompts that was simple and fast. Every tool I tried made me switch windows, log in, or open an extension panel or they didnt work on sites i needed them— which broke my flow. So I built a small, easy-to-use browser extension that lets me save prompts whenever I want and access them instantly.

What it does:

* Works on absolutely any site I need it
* Store prompts quickly without switching apps
* Easy to open when needed and completely invisible when not in use
* Minimal, no-fuss interface designed to keep you in the flow

How to use:

* To add it to any site, just open the site and press Alt + P
* Now, you can access the drawer by taking the cursor to the edge of the screen or pressing Alt + P
* Just click the prompt you need and you will get it.

No need to switch screen or unnecessary clicks.

Building a pixel art editor,"https://preview.redd.it/3tftasrq3m4g1.png?width=2557&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ae5269abbf54fe9e600e98fd227ed2157aa121e

Hi, I am building a pixel art editor like Aseprite, but directly on the browser.

I am a web developer who wants to get more into game development. While working on my latest hobby project, I noticed it wasn't easy to edit 2D assets without buying and installing an editor, so it might be helpful for me and others if there were a fully featured browser-based pixel art editor.

That's how I started working on Novaboard.

Right now, I am not looking to monetize the project; I am just looking for helpful feedback on how it could be a better tool overall and how to promote the app so that it reaches the target audience: pixel artists and indie game developers

Stop burning API credits on broken code: I built a tool to develop against the free ChatGPT/Claude tiers,"Hi all,

I’m sure many of you have been there: You’re building an MVP or testing a new feature for your AI wrapper, and you realize you’ve spent $50 on OpenAI/Anthropic credits just debugging your prompt chains.

I built a tool called **LLM Session API** to fix this.

It’s a Dockerized service that turns the **free web versions** of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini into a functional API.

**What it does:**

* Gives you a standardized endpoint (`http://localhost:8080/generate`).
* Supports conversation chains (maintains context).
* Handles the headless browser auth so you don't have to write Selenium scripts from scratch.

**The Idea:** Use this for the ""messy"" phase of development. Iterate on your prompts and logic for free. When you are ready to deploy to customers, change one line of config to point to the official paid API.

**Example Payload:**

    {
      ""provider"": ""claude"",
      ""prompt"": ""Roast my startup idea...""
    }

**The Repo:** [https://github.com/STAR-173/LLMSession-Docker](https://github.com/STAR-173/LLMSession-Docker)

It’s open-source. I’d love to hear if this fits into your workflow or if there are other providers you’d want added!",Decent-Shoe-9187,1pbfttt,SideProject,01-12-2025,15:34:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pbfttt/stop_burning_api_credits_on_broken_code_i_built_a/

This is a very simple app where men can **enter key date just one time** and then receive notification for cycle predictions. If you add more dates, predictions will become more accurate, but it's not neccecary.

View future periods on calendar to **plan vacation**, receive notifications for ovulation to **plan dates** and other important hints.

"Look mom, I crossed 1800 MRR 🥹","about 5 months ago, I thought $1800 MRR was unreachable.

I had made around $500 from lifetime deals on another product but never made any recurring revenue before. every month started at zero and I had to find more users that would find the product useful enough to pay.

That was mentally exhausting. I kept wondering if I had built something real or if it was just a one-time fluke.

So I launched something new, https://www.tydal.co

I introduced a monthly subscription, or like most people call it, MRR

At first, nothing. Then slowly crossed $100 MRR. Then a 200.

Couple months later, I finally crossed $1800 in MRR.

It’s not much.

It’s not the 10k MRR I’m after…

But it’s the first time I feel like this could be a business, not just a side project.

The app I built started with finding something I thought I was good at, and helping others with it, which was marketing.

I feel like the ultimate validation is getting 1 or a few sales but where I’m at I feel like I am at the point to just go all in.

Since launch, I’ve been building, improving, and learning as I go. I’m tracking churn closely. My average user stays about three months. My next goal is improving that and reaching more users

No team. No funding. No viral launch.

Just slow progress and the belief that if I can get to $1800, I can get to $3600.

Then maybe €10k?

The first $100 is the hardest, but the first $1000-$2000 is equally as challenging. But it changed how I see the next step.

If you’re building something, keep going. The compounding comes later.",Lopsided_Funny_6397,1pbfq4m,SideProject,01-12-2025,15:30:11,https://i.redd.it/wbud0b5q2m4g1.jpeg

I’ve spent the last 12 months building apps for Redditors here using no-code and low-code tools. Here’s what I learned (and how I can help you ship faster),"Over the past year, I’ve been quietly building apps for founders, creators, and solo builders on Reddit using just about every modern tool in the no-code and low-code ecosystem.

Flutterflow. WeWeb. Lovable. Glide. Cursor. Replit. Bubble.  
If it helps ship faster, I’ve probably used it on a real project here.

During that time, I realized something important: most people don’t struggle with ideas, motivation, or execution.  
They struggle with momentum.  
And momentum comes from having a real product in your hands as fast as possible.

That’s why, through my agency, I became WeWeb Certified, Bubble Certified, Lovable Certified, and Flutterflow Certified.  
It lets me help Redditors turn ideas into MVPs in 7, 14, or 30 days.  
And if I can’t deliver, I offer a full refund. Zero games.

Here are the types of apps I’ve helped folks build:

• full SaaS platforms  
• mobile apps for iOS and Android  
• niche micro-SaaS tools  
• marketplaces  
• booking and scheduling apps  
• AI-powered dashboards and assistants  
• customer portals  
• community and membership apps  
• internal tools and workflow systems  
• startup MVPs that actually feel like real products  
• lightweight utilities and prototypes that grow into businesses

Some Redditors came with a full idea.  
Some came with a vague “I think I want to build something.”  
Some came with nothing but a problem they wanted solved.

All of them left with a working product.

If you’ve been sitting on an idea or staring at an unfinished prototype for months, I’m happy to help you figure out the fastest path to something real.

Comment below or DM me if you want me to break down exactly how your idea becomes a working MVP in 7, 14, or 30 days. If you’ve got the vision, I’ll handle the build.

Built my dream travel app for group trips after too many chaotic vacations with friends 😅,"I’ve always been the “planner friend” for our group trips. Every vacation turned into the same mess: 4 different group chats, a shared Google Sheet nobody updated, random screenshots of booking confirmations, and then awkward “who still owes what?” conversations for weeks after. The breaking point was a Vegas trip where two friends went to the wrong hotel, half the group missed a dinner time change buried in the chat, and I ended the night doing math on my phone instead of enjoying the trip.

On the way home I wrote in my notes: “There should just be ONE place for everything: itinerary, group chat, map, expenses, photos.” That idea turned into Vacay, a mobile app for group travel.

**Vacay is built specifically for friend trips, family vacations, and group getaways:**

* You create a trip and invite your friends so everything lives in one place.
* There’s a shared live itinerary with dates, times, and locations so everyone knows where to be and when.
* Group chat is organized into channels by topic (food, logistics, activities, budget, etc.) so plans don’t get lost in a giant, messy thread.
* A built-in expense tracker lets people log what they paid and see who owes what, making it easier to settle up at the end.
* You can pin bookings and reservations and see them on a trip map, plus keep all your trip photos together instead of chasing them across different apps.

I made it to get our trips out of chaotic group chats and into something that actually keeps everyone in sync. If you plan group travels and have thoughts on what a tool like this should do better, I’d love **feedback on Vacay.**",Visible_Win_155,1pbezxf,SideProject,01-12-2025,15:02:13,https://i.redd.it/828mtxfcwl4g1.png

"I built an AI App which will generate you Notes with one click explanation, Flashcards and quizzes and much more. Am i over doing it?","4 months ago, I built Wisdom Is Fun, but then I got myself working on a new idea and decided to sell it here on Reddit. Ah, some users called it trash, so I decided to prove them wrong and started working on it again.

Now I’ve built it again with a lot more features with no intention of selling it, and now I feel like I might be overdoing it.

Here is a list of features:

* Instant notes generation with one click to explain troublesome sentences.
* Flashcards and quizzes.
* Capture the question and get an instant answer with a 3-step solution.
* Kanban board and Pomodoro.
* Daily Roadmap generation.
* Advanced ChatGPT-styled chatbot with the ability to talk with generated notes.
* Generate multiple styles quiz with Youtube link, PDF, PPT, Podcast, Syllabus. (Still building)
* Detailed analytics with a point system.

I built this app with the goal that no user should have to turn the page to recall a specific word meaning — it should be instant. So I built the click-to-explain feature so students can get instant explanations of any sentence. No more struggling with doubts — click the image and you’ll get a 3-step solution.

I’m planning to add a leaderboard, but again, I’m getting this thought: am I overdoing it?

STOP COLD OUTREACH! It's a low-effort trap sold by Gurus who never built anything. Here's why I ignore 99% of my DMs.,"The ""Volume is King"" cult is a low effort trap sold by gurus who never built anything. They tell you to spam 100 people a day and track open rates. It's a strategy for failure it failed me.
​When I first launched, I tried the volume game. All I got was an empty inbox full of ""curious"" people who wasted my time. The gurus sell you on effort. I’m selling you on data and survival. As a 16 year old on a tight timeline, I didn't have time to be polite.
​The Guru Model looks for 1st grade intent (""needs X""). I look for Financial Desperation and Prior Trauma.
​I studied the data from the users who actually paid me (even while the code was broken, reinforcing my ""Ship Ugly"" motto). I realized they were never the people who replied to my cold outreach.
​They were the people already ASKING for the solution, shouting their problem to the void.
​You just have to listen for the specific words that prove they are ready:
​They are actively bleeding cash because of past failures.
​They mention competitor trauma (they abandoned a solution).
​They are facing a hard deadline to fix it (urgency).
​If a prospect isn't actively using these words the words of someone asking for help I ignore them. I spend 100% of my time on the high intent 1%. 

​Don't buy the course. Start listening for the ask.

"I built a local community + utility app, but users aren’t adopting it — thinking of a pivot and need honest feedback","Hey everyone — I could really use some feedback from people who build things.

I launched an app that was originally meant to help neighbors in the same ZIP code talk to each other, share events, get local deals, and basically create small community hubs.

Marketing actually went decent — TikTok + IG Reels got attention — but almost **no one who clicked ended up using the app.**  
The same thing kept happening:

People download it →  
They see an empty community →  
They don’t come back.

Totally fair. Nobody wants to be the first person talking to themselves in an empty room.

So now I’m thinking of pivoting the app to solve a real pain point I see every single day as a Florida realtor:

**People who move into a new area have no idea how to find the basics — utilities, water, power, trash pickup, driver’s license, local schools, property taxes, etc.**  
The government websites are confusing. You can live across the street from someone and have *different* electric companies. Nobody has a clean place where everything is listed by ZIP code.

**So the pivot idea is:**  
Pre-load every ZIP code with:

* Electric / water / trash providers
* Local public + private schools
* Govt links (DMV, tax collector, permits, courts)

Basically:  
**Give people something they need on Day 1 of living in a new area.**

Then once they’re already using the app, the chat + events + community features make more sense because they’re walking into something that isn’t empty.

I’m not here to pitch anything — I’m trying to understand if the pivot makes sense before rebuilding.

**So my questions:**

1. Is this a better hook than “community chat”?
2. Does pre-loading the essential information solve a real problem, or am I overthinking it?
3. What would make *you* actually use a local ZIP-based app like this?
4. Any red flags you see before I start development again?

[Launch] PassItOn.To: Expert advice platform where 100% goes to charity. Built in a week.,"Launched today. Here's what I built:  
  
PassItOn.To: Book video sessions with people who've figured things out. 100% of their fee goes to a nonprofit they choose.  
  
Stack:  
\- Next.js 15 (App Router)  
\- Supabase (auth + database)  
\- Stripe (payments, direct to nonprofits)  
\- [Daily.co](http://Daily.co) (video)  
\- Deployed on OCI  
  
Built it in a week. The whole thing is simple because there's nothing to complicate it. No retention hooks. No upsell funnels. No subscription traps.  
  
The model:  
  
$100 session:  
\- Stripe: $3.20  
\- Video: $0.50  
\- Booking fee: $5 (covers costs)  
\- To charity: $100  
  
That $5 barely breaks even. On expensive sessions, we lose money. Don't care.  
  
Why build this?  
  
60% of young adults feel ""seriously lonely."" Our solution is chatbot companions. That's insane.  
  
Real people who've navigated hard things want to help others. They don't want to become ""coaches"" or build personal brands. They want one conversation, then move on with their lives.  
  
This gives them a way to share what they know and fund a cause.  
  
Feedback welcome. Roast the landing page. Tell me what's broken.

solo dev testing stack that doesn't require a phd in selenium,"Building a saas side project nights and weekends, just me no team. Product is working pretty well but I keep introducing bugs when i add features because i'm not testing properly.

"My first paying customer asked: ""PDFs are cool, but can I chat with a website?"" So I built it (v1.3 Update).","I launched **FastRAG** (a Next.js Starter Kit) a few days ago. The goal was simple: Stop writing the same vector ingestion boilerplate for every project.

My first customer (if you're reading this, you're a legend) emailed me immediately with a feature request: *""I want to point it at my blog and chat with the serialized content. PDFs aren't enough.""*

He was right. So I spent last night building the **Web Scraper**.

**What’s New in v1.3:**

* **🌐 URL to Vector:** You can now paste any URL. The backend uses `Cheerio` to scrape the HTML, clean the text, chunk it, and upsert it to Pinecone.
* **📱 Mobile Native UI:** The previous UI looked bad on phones. I rewrote the layout to be fully responsive (full-screen app feel on mobile, floating window on desktop).
* **📑 Mixed Context:** You can now upload a PDF *and* a Website URL, and the AI will answer questions using context from both sources simultaneously.

**The Tech:**

* **Scraper:** `CheerioWebBaseLoader` (LangChain)
* **Vector DB:** Pinecone Serverless (1024 dims)
* **Framework:** Next.js 14

**The Deal:** I'm keeping the **$9 Early Access** price for 24 more hours before the price hike. If you want to save 40+ hours of setup time, grab it now.

I built something for my wife because she spent years fighting with food. I did not expect what happened next,"I have watched my wife struggle with food and guilt for as long as I have known her. Not binge eating, not overeating, just this endless stream of anxious thoughts about food.

The dieting, the guilt, the “I ruined everything again”, the restarting, the fear of failing. The emotional weight was heavier than the physical one.

And honestly, it hurt to watch. Not because of her body, but because I could see how tired she was. How much energy she spent just trying to “be good”.

One night, after a long day, she asked something that broke me a little inside:

“I am tired of thinking about food every single day.”

It was not dramatic. It was not emotional. It was quiet. It sounded like giving up.
Something clicked in me. Not out of heroism, but out of love.

I am a developer. I am not a nutritionist, not a coach, not a doctor. But I do know how to build things that make life a bit easier.

So I started coding.
I built a small tool that could recognize food from a photo or a voice note and log the meal for her without stress. No calorie walls, no numbers, no punishment. Just simple structure.

Instead of “what did I eat today” and “how many mistakes did I make”, it became something neutral, almost comforting.

Then something unexpected happened.
She stopped naming foods as “good” or “bad”. She stopped looking up diet rules every night. She started walking without guilt. She started eating without fear.
And weirdly, I started changing too.

Not to diet. Not to lose weight. But I finally understood my own patterns a bit better. Food stopped feeling like an enemy. It became normal.
Then family friends got curious. Step by step, this private project for one person turned into something bigger.

I am not posting this to advertise anything. Honestly, I still feel scared sharing it publicly. I made it for her, not for the internet.

I just want to say this:

If you feel stuck in that exhausting cycle of thinking about food all the time, you are not weak, you are not broken, and you are not alone.

Sometimes the biggest improvement is not the number on the scale. Sometimes it is simply being able to breathe again.

If anyone is curious what exactly I built or how it helped us, I am here.

No BS Secret Santa App!,"Over-engineering? On a Saturday!?

Well, yes. So technically this all started last year around the same time. Christmas was looming, and we had decided that this year we were going to do ""Secret Santa"". Secret Santa is where everyone becomes the ""secret santa"" for someone else and buys a gift for that person

The idea is to keep who is secret santa for whom secret until Christmas. Now, living in the modern age, there are plenty of sites that can facilitate setting up Secret Santa and randomizing who gets whom, and of course, keeping it all secret from the participants.

But here is the kicker: Most of them are spam-filled, banner-ad-infested sites that require you to SIGN UP with your EMAIL! I might be an old fuddy-duddy (ask my wife, she'll confirm), but I really don't want to give away my email to some shady website which is then going to sell my data and provide me with years of spam emails, free of charge, just to allow me to do something as simple as select secret santas with my family!

So I said, NO. I refuse! I convinced my family to just let me write a short program to do this instead. I had the program output text files for each participant containing the name of the person they should buy a gift for. That allowed me to run the program, and without looking at the contents of each text file I could just send it to the right person. It worked great!

Now it's that time of the year again. Family members were poking me to ""run that program of yours!"" again. I couldn't find my old project, but rewriting it wouldn't be a problem. I had time over the weekend to do it. This is when I ended up on Santa's naughty list. Instead of writing a one-off program, I started over-engineering the crap out of it.

Not only a program. No. A whole web app. Yeees. Available online! Without signup, tracking, and spam? Of course! I could write the perfect Secret Santa service. The service I had always wished for. A Christmas gift to myself and to the whole world. So I wrote a Java servlet, deployed it on Heroku and added a DNS CNAME entry to point apps.pointlessgames.net to it. Did I spend 95% of the time making CSS tweaks and JavaScript ease-of-use functionality? Uh-huh. Did I stay up until 2 AM last night? Yup. But is it live and free to use? YES!

So if you don't mind, please have a look at [https://apps.pointlessgames.net/secret\_santa](https://apps.pointlessgames.net/secret_santa) and give it a try :) And if you are also planning to do Secret Santa and don't want to sell your soul to the ad-devil, use this instead! You can use it as many times as you want, share it, whatever you want. No signup, no tracking, no nothing.

Side hustle from 0K - 100K in a few months (Still works),"My name is Tim. I’m from Hoofddorp, a small town next to Amsterdam. I work full-time as a teacher and I teach history at a primary school. Alongside my full-time job, I have always traded in domain names. I have successfully sold many domains, such as hond.nl, fietsenwinkel.nl and many more. For over twenty years, I’ve earned an extra monthly income this way. Sometimes I made €3,000, but usually between €1,000 and €1,500 per month by buying and selling domain names.

However, the past year has been very disappointing because there are very few good names left with extensions like .com, .eu and .nl. I was actually thinking about quitting… until I had a conversation with a colleague who emigrated to Dubai. He told me that the .ae extension is becoming increasingly popular among locals and many international companies due to tourism growth.

Especially in the real estate sector, .ae domains are used more and more to build trust when selling expensive villas. You can easily buy .com or .nl domains anywhere, which has led to a lot of scammers. A .ae domain, on the other hand, is harder to obtain and requires passport verification before the government approves the registration (you don´t need to have a pasport-ID from the emirates, you just need to have an ID and that´s it.. I live in the Netherlands and that´s also fine.

So I decided to give it a try. In the first weeks I invested €360, because through hosts like OnlyDomains you pay around €36 per year for a .ae domain. I immediately bought the domains palmjumeirahvillas.ae and palmjumeirahhotels.ae. Within a week I sold them simply by emailing real estate companies with an offer.

In the first month I earned €9,800, and the month after that €15,600. It continued like that for a while. Recently, I’ve noticed that competition is increasing and profits are slightly lower, so I started flipping: I bought domains I had previously owned again and resold them within a week with a 60% margin. In the end, I’ve now made €100,000 and I’m enjoying my time alongside my job even more.

I hope young, driven entrepreneurs read this and find some motivation. There are so many opportunities as long as you think of a good idea and apply it to a niche that is rapidly growing. Follow the market! We can clearly see that the housing market in Dubai is extremely popular, so we respond to that.

Built an ESPN MCP Server - Real-time NFL/NBA/NHL data for any AI assistant,"Hey r/sideprojects! 👋

I built an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives AI assistants access to live ESPN sports data.

**Example questions you can ask:**

* ""What are the current NFL standings?""
* ""Who's leading the AFC North?""
* ""What's the Broncos record and remaining schedule?""
* ""What NBA games are on tonight?""
* ""Show me the NHL playoff picture""
* ""How many games back are the Chiefs from the division lead?""

**What it provides:**

* Real-time NFL, NBA, and NHL standings
* Live scores and schedules
* Team stats, records, and streaks
* Playoff brackets and seeding
* Flexible team lookup (city, nickname, or abbreviation all work)

**Why I built it:**

I'm developing [rootfor.app](https://rootfor.app) \- a site that tells sports fans who to root for in every game based on playoff implications. I needed live standings data while writing content and got tired of tab-switching to ESPN. Now my AI assistant just knows the current stats.

**Tech Stack:**

* TypeScript
* Model Context Protocol (MCP) SDK
* ESPN's public API

**Installation:**

    npm install -g espn-mcp

Add to your MCP config:

json

    {
      ""mcpServers"": {
        ""espn"": {
          ""command"": ""npx"",
          ""args"": [""espn-mcp""]
        }
      }
    }

I couldn't forget Duolingo bird so I built a tool that generates & animates mascots,"Edit: we have heard your feedback and implemented free mascot generation!

In my network, there are quite a few startups that are building their startups solely around marketing funnels instead of products. And the most successful ones are using character-based marketing- creating some pixar-like/animated character and really leaning into that. That reminded me of Duolingo success as well.

I thought why more brands are not using mascots/characters?

So I participated in a Cursor hackathon a month ago, won $15k 1st place cash prize, quit my job and committed to this idea full-time- today is launch day.

Trends I am building for:

1. Character-based marketing has been on an upwards trend, producing incredible results to companies advertising through consumer channels. Duolingo is the prime example.

Distribution is everything nowadays and if mascots mean better ROI on your marketing efforts, then mascots it is! 📈

2. We are betting that more and more AI-first software companies will associate their brands with characters- they all have character built-in, why not associate it with a memorable body? 🤖

3. The amount of online (tech/ecom/digital products) business is growing exponentially. You can one-shot a calorie tracker app or a Shopify ecommerce store with a single prompt, but everyone is using the same tools and models to do so. 🟰

This means sameness all around- that’s where a well-developed brand character can become your moat.

And personally, I am kinda done with this utopian futuristic minimalism.

But thats me.

I built a productivity AI on WhatsApp. Users loved it. WhatsApp banned me. So I rebuilt it as a native Android App.,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share my journey (and my new app) with you.

A few months ago, I built an AI agent that worked entirely inside WhatsApp. The idea was simple: instead of fighting with complex calendar apps or to-do lists, you just text your ""Assistant"" like a friend. It worked. People used it to dump tasks, get gentle reminders, and manage anxiety. Retention was amazing.

Then, on the exact day I got my first paying subscriber... WhatsApp blocked the account.

I realized relying on ""rented land"" was a mistake. So I spent the last few months rebuilding the entire experience from scratch as a native Android app called **Taskai**.

**What it does:**

* It’s a Chat Interface (feels like texting).
* It focuses on **EQ (Emotional Intelligence)**. It doesn't shame you for missing tasks; it helps you reschedule them guilt-free.
* It has Morning Briefings and Evening Reviews to help close ""open loops"" in your brain.

I just launched on the Play Store. It’s free to try (no ads).

I’d love to get feedback from the Android community. Does the ""Chat"" format work better for you than a standard checklist?

The PMF framework that tells you if your Startup will survive,"People talk a lot about if a startup has product market fit or not - but up until this thoughtful article, there wasn’t much on how to iterate towards it.

[https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/](https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/)

In short, Survey your user base with Sean Ellis’ PMF questions to benchmark your level of PMF.

But then, segment your user base based on the titles of who answered and how they answered.

Then do methodical feature prioritization work by allocating your engineering resources partially against users that are close to PMF but not there yet, and partially against those who are already fans.

Rarely does a product jump out of the gate with strong market fit.

This article documents how to thoughtfully and rigorously iterate towards it.

[WIP] I'm building Clipwise: A Mac app to fix your messy Kindle highlights with AI! (Seeking Feedback!),"Hey r/macapps! 👋

As a fellow **Kindle** reader, I was constantly frustrated with how messy highlights become - reviewing them on the device is clunky, and that raw text file is useless. So, I decided to fix it!

I'm building **Clipwise**, a native macOS app designed from the ground up to make managing your **Kindle** highlights a breeze.

Here's the magic it does:

* **AI Cleanup:** Automatically cleans up broken book titles and author names.
* **Smart Tagging:** AI auto-suggests relevant tags for your highlights.
* **Local & Private:** Everything is saved to your local database - no clouds.
* **Effortless Import:** This is my favorite part! **Clipwise automatically detects when your Kindle is connected** and a handy import button pops right up in the menu bar. 🤯 No more digging for files!

It's very much a **Work In Progress**, but I'm eager to share and get early feedback. I've attached some **WIP** screenshots below to show it in action (main window, menu bar item, import flow).

What are your thoughts? Any features you'd love to see or common pains you have with Kindle highlights?

Thanks for checking it out! 🙏",shiro90,1pbcc9z,SideProject,01-12-2025,13:08:45,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pbcc9z
I built a tool to turn your project screenshots into smooth showreels for your portfolio,"Hey everyone,

  
I’ve always felt that static screenshots don’t do justice to the work we build.

  
If you have multiple projects, you end up making multiple posts, multiple images, and clients or followers still don’t see the whole flow.

So I built **Reelfolio**, a tool that turns your screenshots or short clips into clean animated showreels in under 2 minutes.

It helps you:

* Show the full experience instead of a few static shots
* Present multiple projects in one clean reel
* Improve your portfolio with motion and transitions
* Share your work on X or anywhere else in a more engaging format

In a world where attention spans keep shrinking, these short, smooth transitions help people instantly grasp your work.

I’d love to know what you think.

"Fast Web Generation for Devs , Designers and Agencies","Hi everyone,

I’m working on a project called Thati, a tool to help people build websites that truly represent them, whether it’s a personal brand, portfolio, or company profile.

Right now in Phase 1, we are focusing on generating websites quickly and letting users export them to their preferred CRM or website editing tools. The main audience we are exploring are individuals and agencies.

Later in Phase 2, we plan to add a user-friendly website editor that does not require technical skills, domain connection and deployment features, and a collection of beautiful themes for different categories.

In Phase 3, we will integrate AI more deeply into the editing process, add more exporting options, and focus on generating strong themes that users can easily customize.

We also have a short demo video showing the most important feature of Phase 1, which is the onboarding process. It highlights how fast and simple it is, designed to save time and reduce costs for both designers and regular users. Agencies or freelancers can send a client the onboarding link, and once the client fills it out, Thati generates the website directly in the agency’s account, so the client never sees or accesses the generated site before the agency edits it. Normal users can also use the onboarding feature for themselves to generate their own websites quickly. This makes creating websites much faster, allowing designers or users to focus on finishing the project instead of starting from scratch.

If this sounds interesting or relevant, there is a short form for people who want to try the tool early and provide feedback with a long free trial included:

That is exactly why I built OccaTune, to enable and guide anyone to create similar moments. 

I know this is already possible with Suno, but OccaTune differentiates it two ways:
- It's credits based. So no subscription required. You can generate the occasion song and be done until the next one.
- It guides the user by creating a personalised fields form specific to your occassion to help you with generating lyrics and setting the style.

FilterBaby 20% Off Discount - RAY20,"I picked up the Filterbaby skincare filter a few weeks ago after getting tired of how harsh my tap water felt on my face. The difference was subtle at first, but noticeable. My skin doesn’t feel as tight or dry after washing, and the water itself comes out smoother and less “chemical” smelling. It’s not some dramatic transformation, but the overall feel of my skin has been better and less irritated.  
  
Install was quick with the included adapters, and it hasn’t affected water pressure in any meaningful way. The biggest thing to understand is that it’s more of a long-term quality-of-life upgrade than a miracle skincare fix. If your water has chlorine or hardness issues, it makes a real difference. If your water is already very soft, you probably won’t notice as much.  
  
Overall, it’s been a low-effort improvement to my routine. Cleaner water doesn’t replace moisturizers or serums, but it does make the whole process easier on your skin. Would recommend if you’ve dealt with dryness, irritation, or just want a more gentle face-washing experience.  
  
You can use code RAY20 to get 20% off discount as well. Hope it helps!",Positive-Log-4942,1pbbisk,SideProject,01-12-2025,12:29:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pbbisk/filterbaby_20_off_discount_ray20/
"Day 6 of my 20-day open-source challenge: BioBear — a beautiful, privacy-friendly Linktree alternative","I’m on Day 6 of my 20-Day Open-Source Challenge, where I ship one useful tool every day — fully open-source.

Today’s build is BioBear 

A fast, minimal, privacy-friendly **Linktree alternative** that doesn’t lock basic features behind a paywall.

# What BioBear Does

BioBear lets you build a clean, customizable “link in bio” page in seconds:

**Features:**

* Unlimited links
* Drag-and-drop ordering
* Multiple themes (light, dark, gradient, pastel, neon)
* Custom accent colors
* Profile picture + bio
* Social icons (Twitter, GitHub, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc)
* Highlight (primary) links
* Public page like [biobear.app/yourname](http://biobear.app/yourname)
* Basic analytics:
   * total views
   * link click counts
   * per-link performance

No paywalls.

No storage of personal data.

No tracking beyond anonymous click + view counts.

And because it’s open-source → you can self-host, theme it, or turn it into whatever you want.

# Why I Built It

Linktree is great, but:

* customization = paid
* themes = paid
* analytics = paid
* removing branding = paid
* looks identical to everyone else
* slow load times
* not developer-friendly
* not self-hostable

I wanted something:

* **fast**
* **clean**
* **free**
* **privacy-first**
* **open-source**
* and fun to theme

BioBear is my take on the “link in bio” concept — simple, beautiful, no friction.

# Tech Stack

* Next.js 14 (App Router)
* Convex (backend + realtime data)
* Clerk (auth)
* Tailwind CSS
* Vercel (deployment)

The whole setup is lightweight and easy to fork.

If you try it out, let me know what you’d add or fix — feedback during this challenge is insanely helpful.",Charrlidon,1pbbfsm,SideProject,01-12-2025,12:25:37,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pbbfsm

How can I make my app not seem like a scam?,"Website: www.oldglorygiveaways.com 
iOS App: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/og-giveaways/id6752662389 

I launched an iOS app two months ago that lets people enter hourly giveaways for prizes, usually a $10 Amazon gift card. It’s completely free, there’s no purchase necessary, and it’s an ad-supported model.  The whole idea is simplicity and zero friction. It’s inspired by HQ Trivia if you remember that app. Obviously I don’t have their crazy budget and it’s still early days. 

So far I’ve had mostly good feedback in App store reviews, and have ~1000 downloads with 300-400 active users. Since it launched, we’ve given away prizes to hundreds of happy winners. It’s going well, but I’m running into the obvious perception issue. Giving away free gift cards immediately looks like a scam, even though the app is 100% legit. 

How can I overcome this? I’ve got a public ledger of payouts, but until someone starts using the app and actually wins, it’s hard for people to verify that this is in fact a legit app. I think this is slowing my growth. 

I want the app to stay simple and fun. And not feel shady. I get why people would assume the worst, but my app is intended to be the opposite of scammy survey apps.

If anyone has advice for handling this perception problem, I would love to hear it.

I’ve been building stock prediction tools for several years this summer I finally turned everything I've learned into a real platform,"I've been building stock analysis tools for several years, and this summer I finally brought everything together into something I use every day: WestBayBerry.

Over the past 3–4 years, I’ve built a lot of prediction and trading algorithms, testing different models, refining what worked, and throwing out what didn’t. After enough iteration, I finally had the experience to build a platform that actually solved the problems I kept running into.  
  
WestBayBerry isn't an automated trading bot, and it's not trying to be. It's designed to be a tool to help filter out noise and make research more efficient. It surfaces technical setups, risk/reward ratios, and timing context. basically automating the manual checks I was doing anyway, but in a cleaner format that saves me wasting time on low probability picks.   
  
**How it works:**   
  
Every weekday morning, the model scans through a list of stocks and identifies setups it thinks have potential over the next 1-2 weeks. Those get published to the site automatically.   
  
If you click into a stock, you'll see the full breakdown under the ""Advanced"" tab. You can also query the system directly for stocks that aren't on the homepage. Just search for any ticker and it'll generate the same analysis on demand.   
  
The graph on the landing page represents stocks selected by the algorithm based on its prediction recommendations as a demonstration of the system’s capabilities. The system only provides recommendations it does not trade on your behalf.   
  
**What you get:** 

Recommendation   
Stock chart   
Score breakdown by category   
Quick stats summary   
Risk management levels   
Entry timing and reasoning   
Specific risks to watch   
Full decision reasoning   
  
There's still plenty I want to refine. I'd really value feedback on a few things:   
Does the landing page communicate what this does clearly?   
Is the dashboard intuitive to navigate?   
What features would make this genuinely more useful?

"[Calmplot] – journaling app that treats your life like a garden, not a todo list","Hi all 👋

I’m a software/cloud engineer who’s terrible at journaling consistently, but really craves deeper self-reflection.

So I built \*\*Calmplot\*\* – an AI journaling app that treats your life like a \*\*garden\*\* instead of a streak to keep alive.

\---

\### Problem I had

\- I’d dump raw notes into my phone or Notion.

\- When I was overwhelmed, I didn’t even know \*what\* I was feeling, let alone what to do.

\- Traditional habit apps made me feel guilty for “breaking the streak”, which ironically made me avoid the app entirely.

I wanted something that:

\- helped me name my emotions,

\- showed me which parts of my life I was neglecting,

\- and nudged me with small actions – without judging me.

\---

\### What Calmplot does

\- 📝 \*\*Free-form journaling\*\* (web app / PWA)

\- 🤖 Optional \*\*AI reflections\*\* that:

\- mirror back what they heard,

\- highlight patterns / tensions,

\- suggest gentle next steps

\- 🌱 \*\*Life garden view\*\*:

\- pick a few areas (e.g. health, relationships, creativity, money),

\- entries “water” those plants,

\- see what’s thriving vs. drying out

\- 📅 \*\*Calendar\*\* to add or backfill entries without losing your “progress”

\- 🔁 \*\*Weekly garden review\*\*:

\- looks at your recent entries and surfaces trends + a tiny action list

It’s not meant to replace therapy or crisis support – more like a structured, kind journaling buddy.

\---

\### What I’d love feedback on

\- Does the \*\*core concept\*\* (life as a garden + AI coach) resonate or feel gimmicky?

\- Is the \*\*UI flow\*\* from:

\`Garden → Today → Journal\` intuitive, or does it feel like too many clicks?

\- For those who journal:

\- Would you trust an app like this with your thoughts?

\- What would you \*need to see\* on the privacy / “How we use AI” side?

I built a web app that scans prices for 51,000 Pokémon cards every day and aggregates them into a kind of “Pokémon market ETF.”

The idea is to make collectible cards comparable to traditional assets like BTC or MSCI World on a year-to-date. You can even drill down on expansions and card level. 
This year, the index is up about 37% YTD, which actually beats both MSCI World and Bitcoin.

"People are using AI to fake ‘proof’ photos, I built a tool that checks if a picture is real, AI-generated, or pulled from social apps.","Lately I’ve been seeing a weird problem pop up more often:  
people using AI or heavy edits to fake “proof” photos — spoiled food, damaged items, tampered screenshots, you name it. A lot of apps and businesses rely on images for verification, and it’s getting extremely hard to tell what’s real anymore.

So I decided to build something for it.

I made a small tool called **NomorAI** that analyzes an image and tries to figure out:

* if it’s a real camera-captured photo
* if it looks AI-generated or edited
* if it seems like a screenshot
* or if it was downloaded/forwarded from apps like WhatsApp or Instagram

It doesn’t store anything, doesn’t keep the image — it just reads the file and returns a simple result with a confidence score.

Right now I’m in early testing, and I want to see how it behaves with a wide variety of real images from different people, devices, and apps.

If you want to try it, here’s the link:

* Did it mark anything wrongly as AI or real?
* Any surprising results?

Built and Published Picmin - A Fast CLI Image Compressor to npm,"I just published my npm package **picmin**, an open-source CLI tool that makes batch image compression fast, simple, and efficient.

## The Problem
Compressing large batches of images has always been:
- Slow  
- Tedious  
- Dependent on multiple tools or custom scripts  

**picmin** fixes all of that.

## What picmin Does
-  Batch compress JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG, and WebP with a single command  
-  **60% faster** than sequential compression via parallel Worker Pool processing  
- Zero-config presets: `aggressive`, `balanced`, and `lossless`  
- **Average 70% file size reduction** while keeping strong visual quality  
- Works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**

Instead of numbers or a display, it uses rows of LEDs to show hours, minutes, and seconds. It looks like random lights blinking, but once you understand the pattern, you start reading it instantly. It’s surprisingly calming to look at, and feels more like an ambient object than a gadget.

Testing a New Audio Storytelling App Looking for Early Users,"Hi everyone ????

I've been working on a small prototype called Silvertung AI. It is an application that lets users turn their writings into audio posts or small audiobooks. You can read the text yourself, or you can have an AI voice do the reading for you. Think of it as sort of a mashup between short-form writing and audio storytelling.

For now, I'm looking to see if the idea has any room for growth. I'm searching out people who write, read, blog, or create audio content to try it and give candid feedback.

Founders Circle: Anyone who joins early and stays active will be part of our Founders Circle, where early supporters get long-term benefits and a real voice in how the app evolves. If you do end up trying out Silvertung AI, I'd love to hear what's working, what could be better, and what you'd like to see next.

used my vacation to build something instead of relaxing like a normal person,"i had a bunch of vacation days expiring in december so i took a week off. one of the things i wanted to get done was cleaning up my google photos because it was at 94% storage and i kept ignoring the warnings.

my problem is i take burst shots of everything and never go back to pick the good one, so i had 30k photos and most were useless backup shots.

i realised i could either spend 2 days manually cleaning everything or spend my entire week off writing a program to do it for me, and as any sane developer would i went with option two :D

it uses \[DinoV2\](https://dinov2.metademolab.com/) running in the browser with \[WebGPUs\](https://huggingface.co/blog/transformersjs-v3) to group similar looking photos together, so you can just pick the good one from each group and delete the rest.

"🎧 Brilliance Pro: My Non-Commercial AI MIDI Co-Pilot (Text-to-MIDI Converter, AI Composer, Suno AI Prompt Helper)","Hello everyone!

It's a **free browser extension** that I built for myself to implement my personal approach to music creation.

I'm not a professional musician, but rather an enthusiast and experimenter. Since this is a non-commercial project, I simply want to share my work with someone and get the community's honest opinion.

**What can Brilliance Pro do?**

***1. Instant MIDI Conversion (Text-to-MIDI)***

The core function is a simple converter of text-based notes (textual description) into a MIDI file that can be opened in any DAW. Since it's a browser extension, I added direct integration with **BandLab** to speed up the process significantly.

***2. AI Composing Assistant***

I constantly work with AI chats (ChatGPT, Gemini) and created an improved **prompt engine** that trains the chat to better understand musical structure.

* You can **copy this training prompt** directly from the extension and use it in any chat you prefer.
* The chat helps you write textual descriptions of melodies, which you can then copy back into Brilliance Pro to generate the MIDI file. This is a powerful tool for experimentation and finding new, non-trivial melodies.

***3. AI Prompt Helper for Suno (New Feature)***

I just developed the first version of the **AI Prompt Helper**. It's a **song prompt constructor**:

* You select the genre, mood, tempo, instruments (or exclude them).
* The constructor generates a detailed prompt with all the technical data for your song.
* I focused on **Suno AI**, but since it’s a general song description, the prompt can be used in any generator. If you, like me, are tired of writing technical prompts, this tool will **save you a headache**.

**Additional Features**

* **Prompt Personalization:** You can add your unique style, and the training prompt will incorporate it when working with the AI chat.
* There are also other convenient features, such as notes.

I am currently fixing the last bugs and will soon update the extension, adding the AI Prompt Helper for Suno.

**🔗 Link to Brilliance Pro (**[Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/jceeokphplnkcnbifjkfmldmmgjjfknm?utm_source=item-share-cb)**)**

I would be extremely grateful for your **feedback**!

1. **Is this type of tool something you need?**
2. **How would you like to see it developed?**
3. **Are there any features absolutely essential to your workflow?**

# In this community, this post will be the official place where I will inform about all changes and updates.",Oleksd10,1pb9r4v,SideProject,01-12-2025,10:51:11,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pb9r4v
"When it comes to SaaS KISS it, otherwise keep building features","Let me tell, we are not going to talk about KISSes, but we definitely going to talk about KISS.

Let me clear it out **KISS: (Keep it simple silly)**

As i am developer so i will talk from developer's POV

It sounds simple but hard to follow, because we developers have an itch to make things complex and keep adding feature, even when nobody wants it.

Well KISS says that what ever you build, just keep it simple, easy to manage, keeping only things needed, saying no to more and yes to less.

When we start building SaaS, we aim for the perfection for its first version, and while building it we go through the series of thought, for example.

* I got an idea
* I am gonna build it
* I need this list of feature
   * And that list contains features and more
* I found this feature, let me add it (not even launched yet)
* I found another feature let me add it too (still not launched yet)
* Oh this is a must feature, here it goes (still not launched yet)
* and this things go on and on and on.

The issue is with the thinking that you need more feature to get payment from customer, but the reality is that you need 1 feature working perfectly to get the payment or to sell it.

Your core feature should work almost perfectly, so user can actually use it and get value out of it.

You MVP or first version should have that one feature that is it, nothing else is needed until you do not get user.

Make your MVP simple, clean and with a working one core feature, don't over complicate it, just keep it simple.

For example if you are going to build a copywriting with AI SaaS, then the core feature that you must build is copywriting with AI, other features like, publishing, emails, analytics, recommendation will only be implemented when users asks for it, otherwise say no to it

Even when you have a mature customer base, then also follow KISS to no over complicate the things.

**How you can proceed to build SaaS using KISS let's see**

* Choose an Idea
* Build the MVP, with one core feature, don't overthink
* Market it, let it our, let people test it
* Get users
* And improve the product based on the feedbacks of you users

If you  are thinking that KISS only applies to MVP or developer's field that you are wrong. You can follow the KISS in real life or in other areas. Well this will get bit philosophical, so we don't get into it.

P.S: I have build a SaaS using KISS in 2 days you can visit it at [waitbridge.com](http://waitbridge.com)",aforaman25,1pb9pqx,SideProject,01-12-2025,10:48:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pb9pqx/when_it_comes_to_saas_kiss_it_otherwise_keep/
Is it just me or do you guys also struggle with taking notes?,"i’ve been really wrestling with getting stuff out of my head lately. the ideas are there, but when it’s time to actually write them down i either get lazy, keep pushing it off, or straight-up forget what i was even excited about five minutes ago.

I even observe that while I'm speaking with someone, something intriguing comes to mind, but I totally forget about it thereafter and even even forget what we we're talking. When I try to brainstorm, the same thing occurs. I have ideas, but I never write them anyplace.

So I went on Google, tried a bunch of products, hoping to find something that could turn my voice into proper notes. Some tools were overfitting and some were underfitting, and the ones that perfectly suited my use case were expensive.

So In the end, I have made a basic voice note-taking app of myself.

You can just simply speak, and the AI transforms it into well structured notes for self-reflection, brainstorming, discussion summaries, meeting notes and other purposes. it's been really beneficial for me till now when i ever i got to a meeting or i just want write down something or just brainstorm ideas.

So now i have decided to share it with others to see if anyone could relate to this issue. also, if you get a chance to play around with it, could you let me know what actually feels useful, what’s kinda No, and what features you wish were there? that would help me a lot.

Built an AI scanner + execution bot for Deribit options - want feedback,"Been working on this for a few months and finally ready to share.

It's called Volarion - an AI-powered scanner and execution tool for Deribit options (BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, Gold).

**Why I built it:** I got tired of manually scanning options chains and missing setups while away from screens. And when I did have positions open, tracking multi-leg strategies was a nightmare - legs scattered everywhere, no unified view.

**What it does:**

*Scanning & Execution:*

* You set your own criteria (IV levels, Greeks thresholds, strategy type, whatever matters to you)
* AI runs scans based on your rules and alerts you via Telegram when something matches
* One-tap to execute on your connected Deribit account

*Position Monitoring:*

* TP/SL monitoring & alerts
* Sentry metrics - basically custom watchdogs you define. Want an alert if delta exposure goes past a certain level? Or theta decay hits a threshold? Or IV spikes? You set it.
* Aggregates trade legs into actual strategies - your iron condor shows as one position with combined P&L and Greeks, not 4 random legs
* Visual P&L charts and Greeks dashboard

**To be clear:** No trade recommendations. No signals. You define everything, you decide everything.

Why most solo founders never find a cofounder (but should start anyway),"I got a DM asking: ""If I can't find a cofounder, should I wait?"" My short answer is NO.

Most founders waiting for a cofounder are actually waiting for permission to start. They're waiting for someone else to validate their idea. Someone else to take the risk.That's backwards.

The founders who move fastest are the ones who: Start alone , Talk to customers, Get real feedback, **THEN find a cofounder (if they need one)**

Why? Because by then you know exactly what you're building. You're not looking for someone to validate your idea. **You're looking for someone to scale it.** That's a way different conversation.

If you're solo right now, don't wait. Move. Get customer feedback. Build something. Then when a cofounder shows up, they're joining something real, not a deck and a dream.

That's also why I do free sprints with solo founders. Most of them discover they don't need equity, they just needed momentum and clarity.

Built an on-chain volatility prediction game on Arbitrum. Looking for a community partner to split rewards with,"https://preview.redd.it/158qlro9kk4g1.png?width=1515&format=png&auto=webp&s=036afd115d91b50000a5b9178df650868153663d

  
**Hey everyone,**

I’ve been working on a side project called **CandleWars** ([playcandlewars.com](http://playcandlewars.com)), and I’m reaching out here to find a partner who has an existing audience or traffic source (crypto/trading focused) to collaborate with on a reward-split basis.

**The Problem I Saw:** Right now, the crypto market is moving big, but it’s incredibly difficult to trade profitably. We are seeing huge volatility, but often in choppy ranges that trigger liquidation cascades for standard long/short traders. I wanted to build something that allows traders to profit from *volatility itself* without the risk of margin calls.

**What I Built:** CandleWars is a 100% on-chain volatility prediction market built on **Arbitrum**.

* **The Concept:** Instead of betting on price *direction* (up/down), players predict which asset (e.g., BTC, ETH, SOL) will have the **highest volatility** performance during an 8-hour round.
* **The Tech:**
   * **Smart Contracts:** Fully handles the pool and payouts.
   * **Oracles:** Uses Chainlink for verifiable, tamper-proof market data.
   * **Non-Custodial:** Players verify every action in their wallet (login, prediction, claim rewards). We never hold user funds.
   * **Discord Integration:** I’ve also built a custom Discord bot to keep the community engaged with round updates.

**What I’m Looking For:** I am a builder/dev, not a marketer. I have the product ready and working, but I need someone to help get eyes on it. I’m looking for a partner with a **relevant audience** (traders, crypto enthusiasts, gamers) who wants to offer their community a fun, transparent way to compete.

* **The Deal:** I am offering a revenue/reward split for the traffic/users you bring in.
* **Why for your audience?** It’s a ""safe"" way to satisfy the trading itch (gamified volatility) without the stress of leverage trading.

If you run a community, a newsletter, or a traffic source and this sounds interesting, I’d love to chat about how we can structure a split.

Feedback on the project itself is also very welcome!

I built a link-in-bio page for your beliefs,"I got tired of trying to explain my views in Twitter threads, so I built ViewTree – it's like Linktree, but instead of links to your stuff, it's a clean page of what you actually believe, support, or oppose. No more explaining nuanced topics over and over.

Check it out: [https://viewtree-test.vercel.app/](https://viewtree-test.vercel.app/)

**How it works:**

* Sign up, pick your username (viewtr.ee/@yourname)
* Add ""view cards"" – I believe X, I support Y, I'm uncertain about Z
* Drag to reorder them however you want
* Customize your theme, add your bio and socials
* Drop the link in your bio, or share with friends and fans

**Main features:**

* **Copy views from others** – see a view you agree with on someone else's page? Click to add it to yours
* **Drag-and-drop ordering** – arrange your views however you want
* **Live preview** – see exactly how your public page looks as you edit
* **Custom themes** – make it match your vibe (background, colors, font)
* **Different view types** – ""I believe,"" ""I support,"" ""I oppose,"" ""I'm uncertain about,"" or write your own

**Why I built this:** People kept asking ""what do you think about X?"" and I had nowhere to point them. No good way to say ""here's what I stand for"" without writing an essay every time or maintaining a pinned thread.

**Current state:**

* Fully functional MVP
* Free to use
* Launch coming in a few days, on Vercel for now
* Takes \~2 minutes to set up

And sure, it’s cool that more people can build things — that part is great — but it also feels like we’re lowering the bar so much that “developer” is starting to mean nothing.

My minimal new-tab extension Essentio just got the Chrome Featured tag — would love your feedback.,"Hello all, 

I’ve always loved having a clean new-tab page, and for the longest time Momentum Dash was my go-to. But after the recent AI-heavy updates, it started to feel a bit too much for me. I just wanted something simple again — something that loads instantly, looks clean, and doesn’t try to do everything.

So I ended up making my own version, Essentio. It’s inspired by the old Momentum feel, but stripped down to only what I actually needed.

At the same time, I didn’t want something as plain as a blank new tab or Minim (both of which I really like). They’re super clean, but sometimes too minimal — I still wanted a bit of personality and utility. So Essentio became my attempt at a middle ground: minimal, fast, distraction-free, but still fun to open.

A few people who tried early versions suggested adding small, optional widgets — just helpful things that don’t slow anything down. So now it includes:
• a minimal to-do list
• quick notes
• a coin flipper & dice roller for fun
• a Speed Dial to replace the bookmark bar and give more screen space

Keeping everything lightweight has been the main goal from day one.

I also self-nominated Essentio for the Chrome Featured tag, and it got approved — which felt like a nice step forward for such a small project. It now has 50+ weekly users, which honestly feels great considering I originally built it just for myself.

I’d love honest feedback from this community — what should I improve, remove, or build next?",ChildhoodSerious5369,1pb8qhy,SideProject,01-12-2025,09:47:49,https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/essentio-%E2%80%93-a-minimal-fast/dfclapnipjabchkfgiklmepoafolojep

Amazon SES production limit increase,"Hi, for our startup, we requested a ~~limit increase on~~ Amazon SES for Production use (from the current Sandbox). Initially, they asked some clarification questions about the nature of emails, text, recipient lists etc. So far we have been using fine for dev and staging environments.

We responded saying we plan to use SES only for one-time sign up codes and we don't maintain any recipient lists to bulk bombard emails, since users find the app and choose to signup.

Our request got rejected with no clear reason. Anyone had similar experience?

EDIT (pasting the reason from the attached image):

""We identified some concerns that prevent us from approving your request. Due to security reasons, we are unable to provide specific details"".

EDIT 2:  
To be clear, the request is mainly for Production access from the current Sandbox. More than the number of emails limit, it is about being able to send emails to external users (as opposed to internal with Sandbox).

Looking for recommendations tools to build referral or affiliate program for a Saas,"I’m trying to level up the referral program in my SaaS.

- Limits like “you can’t earn more than 5000 dollars from the same referred user”
- API integration with our product and Stripe
- A full transaction history for payouts and deductions

I built Mirame360.com — a place to share and embed 360° photos and videos,"link: [https://mirame360.com](https://mirame360.com)  
  
Hi everyone!

I recently bought a 360 camera and was surprised by how difficult it is to properly share and store 360° photos and videos. YouTube allows 360° uploads, but the quality drops a lot because of the compression, and the ads don’t help either. Because of this, I ended up building a small platform that lets you upload, save, explore, and share 360° content without losing quality.

It’s completely free right now while I’m still developing it and figuring out what people actually need. I’d really appreciate any feedback — whether the uploading feels smooth, if the viewer works well for you, or if there’s anything you think is missing. I’m very responsive to suggestions and would love to shape the next features based on what early users find useful.

I built it with React, Django, and FFmpeg, running on Kubernetes. If you give it a try, let me know how it goes and what would make it more valuable for you.

How I made my first 400 bucks within 2 months!,"Like most of the people here I am also trying to make a side income that can earn me a decent amount of money. But it is not as easy as it sounds. You really have to grind and understand the market where you want to sell your product and find the pain point.

  
I was stuck for months trying to write the main product for my niche , like creating ADHD-Friendly Budgeting Templates. I was spending hours fixing typos when I should have been making sales. I realized the goal is Strategic Sourcing, finding great content, not fixing bad content.

Then, I found **PLR (Private Label Rights)** content. This is ""done-for-you"" content, like articles, templates, or eBooks, that you can legally adapt, rebrand, and resell as your own.

The best method is the **Mix-and-Match Strategy** to build a unique product:

* **The Core (50%):** Buy a PLR eBook on your main topic.
* **The Tool (30%):** Add a PLR Template Pack (like Notion or Excel trackers).
* **The Edge (20%):** Throw in PLR Articles or Checklists on a micro-niche sub-topic.

You must always filter what you buy. I learned this **4C Curation Checklist** from someone I followed throughout my journey and was super successful in this field. Hope this helps you too.

* **Content Depth:** Look for specific steps and unique methods, not just clichés.
* **Customizability:** Ensure it's in an editable format (Word, Canva links, layered PSDs), not a locked PDF.
* **Commercial Viability:** Check for current trends and modern tools (Notion, AI), not obsolete topics.
* **Competition Check:** The design should look clean and modern; ugly fonts and clutter are red flags.

You can find high-quality content on **Premium Marketplaces** (like PLR(dot)me for health/self-help or Innova Thrive for templates) for your core products. Use **High-Volume Membership Sites** (like IDPLR) for cheap lead magnets and filler content. Every dollar spent on quality PLR saves you an hour of tedious labor.

Made a small macOS launcher to organize apps & websites — 7-day free trial,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been working on a small macOS app called OrbitRing and thought I’d share it here. The idea is simple: it’s a quick launcher that lets you organize websites, apps, and scripts into circular “rings” for faster access.

I built it mainly to help with my own workflow. I often juggle multiple browsers and tools, and opening the right thing at the right time used to feel unnecessarily clunky. OrbitRing lets me keep everything in one place and launch what I need with minimal clicks.

Some of the features I find most useful:
	•	Custom rings: group your apps, websites, and scripts in a visual, circular layout.
	•	Browser selection: choose which browser to open a website in.
	•	Lightweight & fast: designed to stay out of the way and save time.
	•	Flexible organization: config items, reorder, or create multiple rings for different workflows.

It comes with a 7-day free trial, and after that it’s a one-time purchase of $5.99 — no device limit.

I don’t have big plans to monetize it aggressively — it’s mostly a personal project that I hope can be useful to others too.

Here’s a short clip showing how I use it in my daily workflow. I’d love to hear any feedback or suggestions from this community — I’m still improving it and always open to ideas.

Remember the last time you used Sticky Notes?,"I remember the feeling of using physical sticky notes. I would dump small thoughts, make quick checklists, and toss them once they were done. Life felt simple and convenient.

In this digital age, we’re prone to using note apps or to‑do list apps to replace sticky notes. I’m not saying there’s a problem with that, but most of the time I don’t need a full on note app or a full on to‑do list.

So how does a digitalized, transitional sticky note help my productivity? Imagine this: you’re going to the grocery store. Most of the time, you would use your note app with a checklist to list the items you want to buy. I’ve talked to a couple of close friends, and that’s how everyone does it.

The problem is:

* The notes (which are supposed to be for important things) end up cluttered, and over time, it’s harder to find the important ones because they’re buried under throwaway lists.
* When I arrive at the grocery store, I have to open the note app and sometimes even search for the note just to view the items and tick them off. More often than not, those notes stay there alongside my important ones because there’s no simple way to remove or archive them once I’m done.

How we do it with this digital sticky notes:

* Note down the grocery checklist, and the widget will automatically update on the home screen.
* Arrive at the grocery store -> check off all the items I’ve picked up.
* The sticky note automatically archives once every checklist item is ticked.

This simple workflow keeps my notes uncluttered and actually improves my productivity.

7 months ago I launched v1. Had to wait 6 Months for v2 launch,"Back in May, I launched PromptPerf on Product Hunt. Got 161 upvotes and some brutally honest feedback:

  \- ""Sadly no Gemini"" 

  \- ""API key friction"" 

  \- ""Need multi-model comparison"" — multiple users

I spent the last 7 months building exactly what they asked for. I had been informed that there is a 6 months wait period from ProductHunt before a relaunch hence I decided to make small changes over the period and monitor user behaviours. 

  \*\*What changed:\*\*

  ❌ Before: 3 OpenAI models only

  ✅ Now: 100+ models (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, Llama, DeepSeek)

  ❌ Before: Required API key to try

  ✅ Now: Works without signup — free trial

  ❌ Before: Test one model at a time

  ✅ Now: Compare 5 models side-by-side



  \*\*What I learned:\*\*

  1. Your first launch is research, not revenue

  2. The comments matter more than upvotes

  3. Building what users ask for > building what you think is cool

"Built a free platform to help junior developers get visibility, would love to hear your feedback 🙌","Hey everyone!



I’ve been building a free niche platform for junior developers in Europe who struggle to get their first job.



Most juniors have skills, projects, and motivation — but they lack visibility. Companies never even see them.



So I built Junior Launch:



• create a clean, professional profile  

• upload your projects  

• highlight your tech stack  

• add experience, certificates, and soft skills  

• get discovered by European recruiters  



The platform is fully working and already has its first users.  

I’m improving it every week (UX, onboarding, filters, search, etc).



If you’re a junior dev, I’d love to have your feedback.  

If you’re a founder, recruiter, or engineer, I’d love to hear what you think could be improved.



Thanks to anyone who checks it out, it means a lot. 🙏

Dumb little site where you can vent - gone in 24 hrs,"Ever have one of those days where you just need to scream?

The catch? Everything disappears after 24 hours. No accounts. No history. Just release.
You can browse other people's screams too (sorted by location - you see nearby screams first). It's weirdly therapeutic watching strangers let it all out.

* duplicates
* domain breakdowns
* usage frequency

* **Double Copy to Translate**: Fast and frictionless.
* **Ninja Mode**: Popup appears at your cursor location.
* **Native & Lightweight**: Pure SwiftUI, no Electron bloat.
* **Multiple Engines**: Supports Google Translate (Free) out of the box, but also connects to **Ollama** or OpenAI-compatible APIs if you want to use local LLMs (like `gemma3-translator`) for better privacy/quality.
* **Smart Close**: Minimize to tray or quit, with a ""Don't ask again"" option. It's open source and I'd love your feedback!

Just got my first sale after failing 10+ projects. Here's what worked (and what I almost quit on).,"Hey peeps!

Quick little win I wanted to share… SupaScans got its first paying customer yesterday. Only $5, but honestly I’m more buzzed about the fact a complete stranger thought it was worth paying for.

I’ve spent a year frying my brain trying to learn to code and vibecoding random apps. Built like 10+ things that went absolutely nowhere close to ship. Kinda gave up for a bit.

Then my partner kept complaining about how she spends hours typing handwritten job sheets into Excel every week. So instead of building something “cool”, I just built something she actually needed.

SupaScans is super simple… take a photo of messy notes/job sheets, AI cleans it up, you copy it into Excel. Takes 1 minute instead of 10-15 mins of typing.

Free to try (5 scans a month). Paid packs are $5 or $29 and they last forever.

Why this first sale mattered to me:

* proves someone else has the same problem
* proves the idea isn’t stupid
* proves my wording makes sense
* proves I can actually ship something useful after failing so many times lol

Biggest thing I learned from all the failures:  
build something someone close to you actually hates doing. Not “startup ideas”.

"My boyfriend and I stopped fighting about chores during finals week by using an ""Exam Mode"" rule. Would this work as an app?","My partner works full-time, and I’m a grad student (plus I work part-time). For the last two years, every time finals week rolled around, our apartment would turn into a war zone.

I’d be drowning in deadlines, he’d come home tired from work, and we’d argue because I forgot to start the dishwasher or he “didn’t know” I had a major paper due the next morning.

The mental load of managing my degree AND the household roster was burning me out.

**So, we built a janky system to fix it.** We connected my Canvas (university calendar) to his Google Calendar (work/life) and created a rule we call **""Exam Mode.""**

Here is how it works:

1. **The Trigger:** When my calendar detects a ""heavy cluster"" of deadlines (like 3 assignments in 3 days), it triggers ""Exam Mode.""
2. **The Action:** It automatically rescheduling my low-priority chores (like vacuuming or laundry) to the weekend.
3. **The Notification:** It sends him a text saying: *""OP is in Exam Mode until Thursday. Her chore shift has been paused. Can you cover dinner tonight?""*

**The Result:** The arguments stopped. I didn't have to ""nag"" him or explain why I was stressed—the calendar told him for me. He felt like a hero for stepping up, and I studied without guilt.

**My Question:** I’m thinking of turning this into a real app for couples/students. It would sync your Syllabus with your Partner’s Calendar to automate this ""load balancing.""

* Would you actually use something like this?
* Is it too niche, or is ""Chore Conflict"" a big enough problem that you'd pay $5/mo to solve it?

About to launch my first Web App - In search of advice,"Hey everyone! I’m JP. A few months ago I started a clothing brand with my cousin called INTENTION CO. The whole message is about living intentionally, but I kept feeling like clothing alone wasn’t enough… I wanted to build something that actually helps people change their habits, mindsets, and daily routines.

So I’ve been quietly building a personal development web app to go along with the brand something that feels like a “home base” for your goals and daily growth.

How it works: When you log in, the app asks you 5 questions about your goals and what you're trying to improve in your life.

From there, the app gives you 5 core pillars. 

* Journaling → AI generates goal-based prompts  
* Habits → analyzes what you're doing well + what needs work  
* Meditation → guided + AI reflection system  
* Manifestation → personalized manifestation scripts  
* Deep Work → tracks focus sessions + routines  

How it ties to the clothing brand: Because the brand + app share the same mission, I wanted the two to support each other:

* Users get exclusive discounts on INTENTION CO. clothing  
* Premium users get a clothing item every 3 months  
* The idea is to create a community where the software + clothing reinforce each other (not just standalone products)  

Questions I had:   
The app goes live on December 10th, and before I start trying to scale it, I really want to know:

1. If you use personal-development / productivity apps, what features do you wish they had?  
2. What would actually make you try a new app like this?  
3. Any growth strategies you've personally seen work for early-stage web apps?  
4. Does the clothing-brand integration feel like a cool perk or unnecessary?  
5. What immediately turns you off from apps in this space?  

I’m genuinely trying to build something useful that people stick with, not another disposable wellness app. All thoughts, supportive or critical, are super appreciated.

Thanks ahead of time.

Built my own HTML→PPTX engine after hitting limits with Gamma and other tools,"A few months into my BTech in CSE, I noticed something strange: we were constantly asked to create presentations, and almost everyone depended on Gamma. It worked well at the start, but the free limits hit fast.

I looked for alternatives like Presenton, but everything felt too template-based. You’re forced into whatever layout they provide, and half the time it doesn’t match the kind of presentation you actually need.

That got me thinking:  
If AI is already extremely good at generating webpages, why not let it generate slide layouts too? And instead of choosing from templates, why not let it produce **HTML/CSS**, then turn that into a clean PPTX?

I tested existing libraries like PptxGenJS and other HTML→PPT converters, but none handled modern CSS well. Flexbox layouts broke, gradients flattened, shadows lost depth, and rounded images had white corner halos. The output didn’t look anything like the source.

So I decided to build my own engine.

I’ve spent the last few weeks turning this into an actual NPM package. It takes a DOM Element, reads the computed styles, resolves the layout, and maps everything into **native PPTX shapes** \- not screenshots.   
  
The goal is simple:  
Let you design slides like a webpage and export them as a real, editable PowerPoint.

"I built a tool that turns your documents into one “AI brain” you can chat with, would love feedback","Hey Everyone,

I’ve been tinkering with a small project and wanted to get some early feedback before I build more features.

I call it **BrainBin**.

It doesn’t use internet knowledge and it doesn’t “know” anything by default.

Instead, its entire brain is whatever files you upload - PDFs, notes, Word docs, research papers, all of it.

Then you can chat with it like a single, connected knowledge base.

A few things it tries to do well:

* **Understands multiple documents together**, not one at a time
* **Connects ideas across files** (methods, themes, contradictions, patterns)
* **Handles context-aware follow-up questions**
* Stays strictly within *your* documents (no outside info)

Some example questions it handles nicely:

* “Compare the methodology in these 3 papers.”
* “Summarize action items from all these project notes.”
* “What patterns show up across the feedback documents?”
* “Where do these files disagree with each other?”

Here’s the MVP if you want to try it: [https://brain-bin-eight.vercel.app/login](https://brain-bin-eight.vercel.app/login)

It’s free with limited usage.

There’s also a waitlist inside the app for anyone who wants updates on the full release - but mostly I’m just trying to see if this is actually useful to people.

I built a Next.js + Pinecone Starter Kit for RAG apps (with source citations).,"**Live Demo:** [https://rag-starter-kit.vercel.app/](https://rag-starter-kit.vercel.app/)

I got tired of setting up the same vector embedding pipeline every time I started a new AI project. So, I extracted the architecture into a reusable **Starter Kit** to save time on the boring setup.

**It handles the heavy lifting for:**

* **Vector Ingestion:** Properly chunking PDFs/Text and sending them to Pinecone.
* **Citations:** The UI highlights exactly which paragraph the AI used (crucial for trust).
* **Streaming:** Smooth, ChatGPT-style token streaming.

**The Stack:**

* Next.js 14 (App Router)
* LangChain
* Pinecone (Vector Database)

It’s designed as a boilerplate—clone it, drop in your API keys, and build your own internal tools or SaaS on top of it.

Made a browser bot that does web tasks for you - and shows you exactly what it's doing,"Hey everyone! Been working on a side project and wanted to share.

It's a browser bot that automates web tasks - filling forms, clicking through pages, extracting data. You just describe what you want in plain English, like ""submit a contact form on \[site\]"" or ""find pricing info on \[product page\]"".

It runs in a real browser so it works on pretty much any website. You can also watch it work with live screenshots if you want to see what's happening.

Next feature I'm thinking about is scheduling - so you could automate recurring tasks like daily checks or submissions.

Would love to hear the feedback.

Every AI app builds its own silo of information about you. ChatGPT knows some things, Claude knows others, coding assistant knows something else.

Email validation APIs all feel the same - am I missing something?,"Been using various email validation services for a while. They all seem to do the same thing:

\- Check syntax

\- Check MX records

\- Maybe SMTP verification

\- Return valid/invalid

Pricing hasn't really changed in years. Features are basically identical.

Things I wanted that I couldn't find:

\- Risk scores instead of just yes/no

\- Typo suggestions (""gmial.com"" → ""did you mean gmail.com?"")

\- AI fraud detection (is this a real person or bot?)

\- Pricing that doesn't start at $50+/month

Ended up building my own ([smartemailcheck.com](https://smartemailcheck.com/)) but maybe I just didn't look hard enough? What validation features would actually be useful to you? Trying to figure out if I'm solving a real problem or just my own?

"I built a little tool to share multiple physical addresses under a single code, no account needed, completely free","Hellooooo, long time lurker first time poster. I’ve been tinkering with a small project and finally pushed it live, it is [addister.com](http://addister.com)

The general idea is you can create a vanity code like **joe-mary-wedding-example** and link it to all the locations people might need (start, finish, parking). Then you just share [addister.com/joe-mary-wedding-example](http://addister.com/joe-mary-wedding-example)

(It is kind of like a linktree for addresses, but it's not tied to an individual of course, I was also loved/hated the concept of ""WhatThreeWords"" so this is my version of it)

I intend to keep it free and no account required

**Some cool features (according to me :D)**:

* You can make a public code (searchable) or a private code (only works via direct link)
* If you want to ""own"" a code you can set your email as the owner and later make edits to it without having to create a profile
* Each code can have one or multiple labeled locations (entrance, parking, pickup spot, etc.)
* Visitors can copy the address or open it directly in Google maps 
* Works on mobile, and you can install it as a lightweight app/PWA

**My friend started using it for:**

* His wedding

That's it haha, but curious what use cases you all come up with!

"In 10 days, I've built the best AI out there to validate team members before hiring them, and I've only used AI.","Hi.



So I entered this hackathon where I was supposed to create software in 10 days to win a prize.



The AI I had to use (as one of the conditions) was Bolt.



So the idea was something I was suffering from. In real life, I run a company that connects students with private teachers, and a problem I faced was finding high-quality, kind, and compassionate teachers. You see, talent is NOT everything. The teacher, or any employee, must align with the company's cultural values and moral code to build a strong relationship with the company.



It's like a soccer team. No soccer team can thrive if the players don't all get along. In fact, the best teams are the closest in terms of relationships. That's a known fact. Same thing in business. Your team members have to be people like you in the sense that you guys would be friends if you hung out, like Dana White and Joe Rogan.



The idea is to create a tool that does a personality test. You see, companies look into 2 factors.

1. Does this person have the skills needed to perform this job?

2. Does he fit this spot? (Meaning: Does he fit the company's values?)



My software was going to take care of the second issue. I'll make my software handle both issues in the future, only if I succeed, though.



Firstly, I searched for the science to see if this is a real issue. I made sure to make a ""science"" public page on my website, where I list everything. I made sure to include ZERO lies in my website and software. Since my moral code is to never lie.



I'll provide the link to my website at the bottom, so if you want to check out the science page and more, you can.



I used Bolt AI to create the frontend and backend.



Of course, there are a couple of issues that need to be addressed.

*1. How am I going to do this?*

*2. What types of questions should I ask?*

*3. Can't people lie on their test?*

*4. The tests are random questions. How would a company get helpful information from this?*

*5. Ok, after the person takes the test, what happens? How does this help the company?*



Let's address them one by one(this is really important if you want to see how this software really works)

Built a fully client-side WhatsApp (kinda) group/solo chat simulator would you use something like this? What should I do with this? Looking for feedback.,"Hey everyone!

I’ve been searching for a tool to create a *realistic WhatsApp group chat video* for a skit - but everything I found was either 1-on-1 only, super limited, or didn’t look like WhatsApp at all. So… I built one myself.

It lets you create and animate realistic WhatsApp-style group or solo conversations for skits, events, short videos, storytelling, etc.

Here’s what it currently supports (all client-side, no backend):

* multiple participants with avatars
* script parsing (`Name: message`, `/typing 2s`, `/delay`)
* typing animations
* “You” messages typed through a fake on-screen keyboard
* reactions (prototype), delays
* light/dark theme
* custom wallpaper
* WhatsApp-like bubble logic (grouping, avatars only once per message run, etc.)
* centered phone preview
* timeline-based playback
* full editor: participants → script → parsed events → playback

**Demo:** [https://elevin01.github.io/FakeGrpChatMaker/](https://elevin01.github.io/FakeGrpChatMaker/)  
(Everything runs locally so no uploads, no tracking, nothing leaves your browser.)

I originally made this for a church skit, but figured it might be useful for:

* TikToks / shorts
* short films
* teachers and presenters
* writers visualizing scenes
* memes
* fake text convos for slides
* roleplay stories

Before I keep building, I’d really love honest feedback:

1. **Would you use something like this?**
2. **What features feel missing before it’s “complete”?**
3. **Should I add export-to-video/GIF?**
4. **Would polished exports make this worth paying for?**
5. **What would make it significantly more useful or fun?**

Any feedback on UX, design, features, bugs, etc is super appreciated. I want to know whether this is worth pulling another all nighter.

Building tiny digital products on the side… didn’t expect this to work lol,"So I’ve been messing around with small digital products for the last few weeks, nothing crazy, just simple planners, templates, and tiny tools I wish I had earlier.

I honestly didn’t expect anything to happen, but a weird thing I noticed:

The simpler the product, the better it does.

I kept trying to build “big” ideas earlier and burned out.

Now I’m doing:

templates

systems (habit trackers, freelance sheets etc.)

planners

minimal PDFs


And somehow these are the ones people actually download and use.

A few things that helped me stay consistent:

• Build something you can finish in 1–2 days
If it needs a whole month, motivation dies fast.

• Reuse the same structure
Don’t reinvent everything, just improve it each time.

• Share it early
I used to wait till it’s perfect. Now I post a rough version and improve based on feedback.

• Keep it fun
Side projects die when they feel like “work.”

Anyway, I’m still super early, but if anyone’s building small digital stuff too, would love to hear what you’re working on.

I built a hub that collects small utility websites because new creators struggle with getting traffic & reviews. Looking for feedback.,"I recently noticed that many people who create their first utility website (PDF converters, calculators, timers, etc.) face the same 3 struggles:

1. **No traffic at launch**

My idea was:

* If someone creates a new tool,
* They can submit it,
* And the hub gives them at least *some* visibility and credibility.

Right now it includes a set of simple tools I built myself, but I want to expand it with more indie-made utilities.

Launched my first mobile app on iOS - Rentably,"Hi all

I launched my first mobile app a couple of weeks ago, with version 1.2 just going through approval, and I'd love for some of you to try it out and provide any general feedback on user experience, functionality etc.

It's quite niche in that it's designed primarily for landlords and allows you to add properties and their tenancies and tenant details, upload docs and share, set up service reminders, log expenses / fees etc. and give an insight into profitability and other metrics.

It also allows for landlords to invite the tenants from their tenancies to use the app and be able to check any shared documents, view their tenancy details at a glance and communicate / raise problems via the app.

I've tried to ensure it has a lot of QoL features like third party sign in, dark mode, Face ID etc.

It's free to download and use from [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rentably/id6754298782). Some more advanced features are subscription-gated but I've absolutely tried to make it free-to-use and capable without paying anything.

Even if you're not a landlord or a tenant, if you do spend 5 mins to install and just play around with it, your feedback would be invaluable.

"My wife complained that I spent too long looking up wines at restaurants, so I built an app to do it for me","Get it here: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sip-savvy/id6747541871](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sip-savvy/id6747541871)

# The Context

I really like wine, but my knowledge is not encyclopedic and drops off pretty rapidly outside of California wines. Even within varietals and regions I’m familiar with, I don’t always know what characteristics to expect from a specific bottle - will this Zin be peppery? Juicy? Etc.

# The Solution

I built an app to streamline this. You set what kind of wine you’re looking for and your price point, take a picture of the wine list, and it does the rest. It returns the menu ranked by:

* **Alignment:** How well it matches your flavor preferences.
* **Value:** The markup compared to retail price.
* **Quality:** Critics’ scores and online ratings.

It also provides a full description/tasting notes for each wine, which many wine lists leave out.

# The Tech Stack

* **Client:** React Native
* **Backend:** FastAPI, deployed on Google Cloud Run
* **DB:** Firestore & Algolia

# The Pipeline (The ""Meat"" of the project)

The hardest part was the photo-to-recommendation pipeline, balancing quality with latency:

1. **Image to Wine List:** This is a combination of standard OCR and agentic image recognition. OCR alone couldn’t correctly parse layout (grouping prices with the right items), but ""agentic alone"" often hallucinated characters. I used **Google Vision** for the raw text and **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite** to structure it.
2. **Matching (List → Database):** Actually the hardest part. Wine lists take a lot of liberty with naming, and it’s tricky to know if a fuzzy match is close *enough*. I used **Algolia** here with custom ranking rules.
3. **Agentic Augmentation:** I have a pre-built database, but to fill in missing entries in real-time, I need live search. I tried Tavily, Perplexity, and Google Search Grounding. **Perplexity (Sonar Pro)** ended up being the best balance of accuracy and performance.
4. **Recommendation:** **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite** for flavor profile matching, and regular old math for calculating scores based on value and ratings.

# Takeaways

* **AI needs guardrails:** It works really well if you use it in small doses with real input data. You can’t (yet) go straight from a photo to a recommendation list in a single prompt without hallucinations.
* **The Latency Trade-off:** It’s hard to get both speed and quality. Since this is for a restaurant setting, I had to work hard to minimize LLM calls to keep it from feeling sluggish.",zyncl19,1pawxq9,SideProject,30-11-2025,23:30:36,https://i.redd.it/75os9mkx6h4g1.jpeg
Looking for blunt feedback on my wake up accountability app idea (social competition with stakes). Would you use this?,"Hey everyone I’m building a behavioral alarm app called **WakeStake** and I’m at the stage where I need honest feedback from people who aren’t friends or family.

As a college student, I know oversleeping is a chronic issue for students and young professionals. Alarms aren’t the problem, but the lack of accountability is. I understand everyone has their own routine for snoozing their alarms and setting it to their favorite tune: I want to take this traditional alarm setup one step further.

**My idea:**  
WakeStake turns waking up into a social and financial accountability system. Users can challenge friends/peers to see who's best at waking up on time. Players can also add small   bets or automatic charity donations. You can compete in groups (friends, classmates, coworkers) or go solo with stakes you set.

**Why I think it’s interesting:**

* Alarms haven’t changed in decades
* Most “heavy sleeper” products fail or break
* People respond more to competition than loud noises
* Current alarm apps don’t use peer accountability at all
* Charity tie-ins make missed alarms meaningful instead of just annoying

**What I need from you:**  
I’d love brutally honest opinions on:

1. What parts feel valuable vs. gimmicky?
2. Does the social/competition angle motivate you or feel annoying?
3. What would make this something you’d try for at least a week?

I'm just trying to validate whether a market exists before I start building the full version. Any feedback (positive or negative) is hugely appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

I built a zero-knowledge tool to stop sharing .env files over Slack,"Hey r/SideProject!

I've been working on a tool called **DotVeil**, and I'd love to get your feedback.

**The Problem:** We've all been there—you add a new API key to your project, and then you have to DM it to your coworkers on Slack/Discord, or worse, someone accidentally commits it to git. Existing solutions are often expensive enterprise SaaS or require trusting a third party with your raw secrets.

**The Solution:** I built DotVeil to be a ""blind"" synchronization tool. It syncs your `.env` files across your team and devices, but with a catch: **the server cannot read your secrets.**

**How it works (The ""Zero-Knowledge"" part):**

1. **Client-Side Encryption:** When you run `dotveil push`, your CLI encrypts the secrets *locally* using a project key (AES-256).
2. **Blind Server:** The server only ever receives encrypted blobs. It has no access to the decryption keys.
3. **Secure Sharing:** We use public-key cryptography (RSA-4096) to share the project keys between team members. It's similar to how password managers like 1Password work, but for your dev secrets.

**Tech Stack:**

* **CLI:** Node.js, Commander, Inquirer (for the interactive bits).
* **Backend:** Next.js 15 (App Router), PostgreSQL, Prisma.
* **Crypto:** Node's native `crypto` module (Argon2 for key derivation, AES-256-GCM for data).

**Why I built it:** I wanted a developer-first experience (CLI-based) that didn't compromise on security. I wanted to be able to host it myself or use a managed version without worrying about a data breach exposing my API keys.

**Links:**

Budget template inspired by my observations(Tithing +Track + Financial Self Analysis),"Hey Everyone 👋 

I am trying to validate an idea and could use honest brutal feedback.

I am building a budgeting template that includes 
• A personal swot analysis 
• A monthly budget 
• A simple gap analysis (where you want to be financially vs where you are now)

I am also thinking of two versions

1. A faith based version (includes tithing and values based prompts) &

2. Secular (excluding no tithing & pure practical)

A few people have shared my previous post so I'm trying to make the ask clearer.

✓Would you personally use a budgeting tool that incorporates SWOT and gap analysis? Why or Why not?

✓ Is having a faith based and secular version smart or just unnecessary?

✓ What part of this feels unnecessary, confusing or overcomplicated?

✓ If you were designing this, what's one thing you'd add or remove?

I am honestly trying to see if this could become a real and potential product if I am over thinking it.

All opinions; negative or positive are super helpful.

building an open-source panic attack support app — would love feedback from people who’ve experienced this,"Hey everyone,  
I recently came across someone’s story about going through a panic attack, and it really stuck with me. It made me look at the current apps out there, and honestly, most of the useful features are locked behind paywalls. The free versions feel way too limited for something that people need immediately in a crisis.

So I’m working on an open-source app that’s actually accessible. I’ve already built a small MVP, but before moving forward I really want suggestions from people who’ve dealt with panic or anxiety attacks.

This is just a passion project. I don’t plan to monetize anything. I just want to create something that genuinely helps people when they’re overwhelmed.

What the MVP currently includes:

* Quick “Immediate Relief” section
* Breathing exercises
* Basic grounding techniques
* A simple “panic button” for when things get intense

If you’ve experienced panic attacks or anxiety, your input would mean a lot. What features would actually help you? What do current apps get wrong? What do you wish existed?

Anything you share can help shape this into something useful.

"I lost my job, so I built my own CV builder with AI while job hunting. Would love feedback.","Hey everyone,

Not long ago I got let go from my job because there was simply no work left for me. Nothing dramatic, just the classic situation of ""there is nothing for you to do anymore."" Still tough to hear.

While looking for a new job, I wanted to update my résumé, and that is when I ran into an annoying problem. Every builder I tried either forced subscriptions, hid the download behind a paywall, or kept pushing upsells. And I was sitting there thinking, ""I am unemployed, why am I paying monthly just to export my own CV?""

Then I reminded myself of something important.  
I am a developer. I can build things.

So I decided to create the tool I wish existed, and I called it **Careerly**.

I wanted something simple, fair, and actually helpful:

* One-time payment (cheap), then full access forever
* Clean, modern templates
* AI features that genuinely help
* Custom cover letters generated from a job link
* Automatic resume filling
* CV analysis
* Support for different languages
* No subscriptions and no hidden walls

I kept it paid for a simple reason. I lost my job, and building this took a lot of time. I am hoping it can help me recover a bit financially, without becoming another overpriced subscription trap.

I built Careerly because I love creating things, and because I needed it myself first. If it ends up helping others who are also job hunting, that would mean a lot to me.

"I built a tool to scrape Play Store reviews, and I just used it to deconstruct the Ten Ten viral collapse.","Hey everyone,

I’ve been working on a side project called **Reviews Extractor -** a Chrome extension that scrapes reviews from sites like G2, Amazon, and the Play Store into Excel.

I built it because I was tired of manually copy-pasting reviews to find feature requests for my other apps.

To test if the ""AI Clustering"" actually worked, I pointed it at **Ten Ten** (the viral Walkie Talkie app currently trending on TikTok). The app is #1 on the charts but has a tanking rating (\~2.8 stars).

I wanted to see if I could reverse-engineer *why* it was failing without reading 1,000 reviews manually.

**Here is what the tool found in about 45 seconds:**

**1. It’s a ""Success Disaster"" (80% of complaints)** My clustering algorithm flagged a massive group of reviews mentioning *""Connectivity Loop""* and *""Internet Sucks.""* It turns out the app has a hard-coded error message that blames the *user's* internet when the servers are overloaded. Users hate this gaslighting more than the downtime itself.

**2. The ""Privacy Panic"" Cluster** This was the most interesting find. The AI grouped words like *""Creepy,"" ""Camera,""* and *""Bathing""* into a high-intensity red flag cluster. Users are terrified that the app forces ""Always On"" camera permissions just to use the voice feature.

**3. The Data Visualization** Here is the chart my tool generated automatically from the raw CSV:

**The Result:** I now have a concrete roadmap for a ""Ten Ten Competitor"" (Fix the servers, remove the camera permission) without writing a line of code yet.

**Try it on your own ideas:** If you are building an app and want to see *exactly* why users are uninstalling your competitors, you can grab the tool for free here. It runs locally in your browser.

2. The Agent

This is more like your personal AI operator:
Upload your files once (PDFs, docs, notes) — no need to upload again

The agent uses your files automatically when answering
Can take notes for you
Can manage your tasks
Can book meetings
Essentially an always-on personal AI assistant with memory

3. Blueprints Hub

Pre-built generators for:
Proposals
SOPs
Project plans
Workflows
Roadmaps
And more

It’s meant to save time on documentation and planning.


My Question:

If you were evaluating a tool with these 3 components:

✓ AI website builder
✓ AI agent with memory + tasking + scheduling
✓ Professional blueprint generators

Built a new app for tracking books + reading progress (Echo),"Hey everyone,
I’ve been building a new app for tracking the books you’ve read, the ones you’re working through, and everything you plan to pick up next. It also lets you create your own custom collections (series you’re following, genres, personal challenges, whatever you want). Basically, think of it as a fresh, lightweight alternative to Goodreads.

It’s still early in development and things might be a bit rough around the edges, so I’m wide open to feedback. If there’s something you think sucks, something missing, or something you’d love to see, tell me. I want this to actually serve readers, not just be another tracker. Also I won't sell your data or shove AI down your throat.

For the next month, you can grab lifetime premium access for free. More premium features are in the works, but the early supporters get everything that comes later too.

If you want to try it out or help shape where it goes, here it is: [echobook.club](https://echobook.club)

Thanks to anyone who checks it out.

I built a gift recommendation AI that refuses to recommend until it actually understands the person,"When my wife and I were dating, I remember walking around the mall for hours looking for a christmas gift for her. But the best I could come up with was a PS3. Not because she liked video games, but because it was the best blu ray player at the time, and she liked movies. That went over as well as you might imagine, and it's a wonder she married me. Especially since the problem hasn't gone away.

But the problem is that I know what her interests are. But my interests are different. I realized: **you have to share someone's passion to know what to get them.** If I was obsessed with gardening too, I'd know exactly what to buy—because it's what I'd want myself.

So I built Giftspan. It's an AI concierge that has a conversation with you about the person you're shopping for—not a 5-question quiz, an actual back-and-forth. It builds a detailed profile of who they are: interests, personality, how they think about the things they love.

Then—and this is the key part—it uses that profile to search for gifts, experiences, and gestures. The AI is a deep expert in basically everything, so it can explore their interests with depth I'd never have. It finds connections I wouldn't think of.

**Some actual results from my own holiday shopping:**

* For my LEGO-obsessed son who loves stop-motion: suggested a 3D printer for custom minifigure-scale bricks and props. I never would have connected those.
* For my wife who knits and misses her college roommate: a premium yarn subscription I'd never heard of + a planned trip to visit her friend.
* For my aspiring-writer sister: membership to a writers' organization and a regional conference for networking. Not a journal with ""WRITE"" on the cover.

It's at [giftspan.com](https://giftspan.com) — first full gift concierge session is free! Then $40/recipient going forward.

Would love feedback on the concept, the landing page, the pricing—anything. This is my first B2C product and I'm learning as I go.

"Hey, so I made another thing that might be useless.","Just like other projects I've made, I created something new (for me) to solve my own problems and decided to make it public.

This time I needed a place to store all the files from all our systems, so I needed a hub for file storage with easy access via API.

So I made ""Brizo."" Why Brizo? I don't know, I asked ChatGPT for a name.

Brizo is exactly that — a storage system. Useful for normal people who just want cloud file storage, and even more useful for programmers who just want to call an API and send their customers' files to the cloud. I've been told the prices are fair enough; might even lose money in some cases.

Anyway, the point of this post is not to promote. I don't expect (and don't really want) to make any sales for now, but I do need people to test the damn thing. Tell me what's broken, use the API, use the S3 integration — we've got a dedicated website for your drive too.

The Android app is pretty much done, but Google made it really difficult to publish new apps, so use Brizo and I might send you an email for testing the app too.

Remember, this is not a substitute for your cloud storage (but it can be used as one) — it's more of a tool for developers.

The API is hosted in Brazil (btw we've got a nice discount if you're Brazilian). If the project goes somewhere, I'll do something about that.

Is it done? No. Will it ever be done? That depends on your feedback.

Paste any product link from any marketplace to our platform, where the link gets scraped for relevant data such as price, stock, shipping times, etc. Create wishlists to organize your products. This way you have somewhere to store all the stuff you eventually want to buy — and keep an eye on prices & availability. Browser plugin coming as a fast-follow to the MVP.

Eventually we want to add a few nice things, like price & stock alerts, and a way to discover other people's public wishlists to find inspiration. Over time, as usage increases, we'd explore AI-powered product suggestions. Mobile support would be nice too.

So instead of searching for another setup, I built myself a place to unload my thoughts. Not a signal app. Not a strategy tool.

A quiet space to journal trades and reset mentally before I blew another account again.

Somehow... it worked. Now i'm turning it into a real app for traders who are tired of pretending they're ""fine"".

Most developers use AI… but very few know how to think with AI.,"That gap is becoming one of the biggest skill differences in our industry:

Built a wine cellar app because I kept forgetting what bottles I own,"Hello 

I collect wine but I’m not organized about it. Bottles end up in different places, I forget what I have, and half the time I’m standing in front of the rack thinking “would this go with dinner?” before just grabbing whatever’s in front.

So I built CellarAI to fix it for myself. The main idea: photograph your labels to build your collection, then ask an AI sommelier things like “what should I open with lamb tonight”, and it recommends from what you actually own, not just generic advice.

I’ve focused a lot on making it fast to add bottles in bulk, you can photograph a whole case and it’ll recognize the wine. Process way less painful. It also tracks drinking windows so it’ll nudge me if something’s getting past its prime. Latest feature I added is an estimated market-value of all the bottles in the cellar. 
Took about a weekend to get the first version working, then another few days adding things like logging bottles when you drink them (with notes on what you ate, who you were with, that kind of thing).

Stack if anyone’s curious:
Lovable for the app (first time using it – worked way better than I expected), Supabase for the backend, GPT-4 Vision for reading labels, Gemini for the sommelier chat.
It’s free, works on mobile, and each user gets their own private collection. A few friends are using it now which is fun.

I built a managed cloud platform to compete with disappointing local providers,"Hi r/SideProject.

Long story short: I’ve been managing infra for years and got sick of the state of cloud solutions here in Romania. The breaking point was a nightmare experience with a bare metal server from ROMARG. I realized I wanted modern features without the massive hyperscaler markup, but with better support than the legacy local providers.

So, I built **DanubeData**.

It’s basically a managed cloud platform running on top of Kubernetes. I know ""cloud wrapper"" can be a dirty word here, but here is what I’m actually doing under the hood:

* **The Hardware:** I'm running on dedicated Hetzner servers (AMD Zen4, DDR5, NVMe). I'm not hiding this—Hetzner is great, but managing bare metal K8s is a pain. I handle that mess for you.
* **The Tech:**
   * **VPS:** KubeVirt.
   * **Storage:** Longhorn for snapshots + Local NVMe.
   * **Networking:** Cilium + Multus.
   * **Metrics:** Prometheus
   * **Orchestration:** GitOps with ArgoCD.

**What you actually get:**

* VPS (starts at €4.50/mo)
* Managed Postgres/MySQL/MariaDB (with auto-scaling read replicas)
* Redis/Valkey/Dragonfly
* REST API resource management
* External DNS endpoints for DBs/Caches to test outside the internal network 
* A lot of metrics
* Daily/on-demand snapshots 
* Upgrade CPU/RAM/Storage in every solution. 
* S3-compatible storage (coming soon )
* Knative serverless containers ( coming soon )

I specifically worked hard on the **database autoscaling**. You can set rules based on time (for daily spikes) or CPU/RAM usage to spawn read replicas automatically.

I launched this recently and I’m looking for genuine feedback from this community. Roast my stack, ask about the KubeVirt implementation, or let me know what features are missing.

I built a tool to generate App Store screenshots with AI - would love feedback from fellow developers,"Hey everyone,



I've been working on a side project called Shotsy that helps app developers create App Store and Play Store screenshots faster. 



The idea came from my own frustration spending hours in Figma trying to make screenshots look good. So I built a tool where you:

\- Upload your app screenshots

\- AI generates marketing captions based on your app description

\- Screenshots are displayed in a clean iPhone frame (looks way more professional than bare screenshots)

\- Export in all the sizes you need



I know there are other tools out there, but I wanted to make something that's quick and doesn't require design skills. The AI handles the caption writing, and you can customize colors, fonts, and layouts. The iPhone frame makes everything look polished without needing to design device mockups yourself.



It's still early days, and I'd really appreciate honest feedback from developers who actually need this. What's missing? What would make it actually useful for your workflow?



There's a free trial if you want to test it out (no strings attached - just want to see if it solves a real problem). You can check it out at [shotsy.org](http://shotsy.org) .



Would love to hear your thoughts, especially if you've struggled with screenshot creation before. What tools do you currently use, and what's the biggest pain point?

I built CouplePay — a tool for couples to pay off credit-card debt together (mvp) 💳❤️,"Hey everyone, I spent Thanksgiving week building something my wife and I wish had existed sooner: **CouplePay**, a simple app that helps couples tackle credit-card debt together.

# What is CouplePay?

* It is not another budgeting app or personal finance tool.
* No bank or credit card login information is **needed**; manual entry of basic data
   * Card Name, Last 4 digits, Balance/Limit, Due Date, Min. Payment, APR Rate
* It is built specifically for two-person households. You and your partner get a shared dashboard showing all credit-card balances. Then you pick a payoff plan together and track progress side by side.
* You can choose a plan (snowball, avalanche, or custom). CouplePay shows how much interest you might save, how many months sooner you could be debt free, and tracks shared milestones like “first card paid off,” “$500 down,” and more.
* The app is built around transparency, teamwork, and shared wins. No judgment, no hidden secrets, just a structured path for couples to get out of debt together.

# Why I built this

Money — especially credit-card debt — is a top cause of tension for couples. Most tools out there are built for individuals. That leaves couples juggling spreadsheets, hidden balances, or one partner handling all bills. I saw an opportunity to build something simple and focused: a shared plan for couples. Because debt should never be the silent third partner in a relationship.

# About the MVP

I am looking for about 100 couples to try CouplePay for free and help shape the product going forward.

As a early user, you will get:

* Full access to the core payoff dashboard and planning tools
* Priority access to new features
* A chance to influence what comes next (shared savings goals, big purchase planning, UI improvements, and more)

**Who This Is For**

This is for couples who:

* Carry credit-card debt and want to get ahead
* Are tired of money causing stress or arguments
* Want to work together as partners to improve finances and trust

If this sounds like you or someone you know, check out **CouplePay** and give it a try. Even if you are skeptical — feedback matters. Honest feedback helps shape how the product evolves.

Here is the link: [https://couplepayapp.com](https://couplepayapp.com)

Yes, it is early — but it is live and works!

I’d love to know:

* What part of this resonates most with you
* What you would want added if you tried it with your partner

Thanks for reading. If you try it, I hope CouplePay helps you and your partner breathe a little easier.

"How I failed for 3 years, then built a tool that now pays all my bills at 20","Hi all, my name is Arthur

I am 20 years old and I started my coding journey at 17  
Tried to learn coding, tried to find a job, and miserably failed  
Then I tried to build an agency, worked on it for a year, and gave up on that idea too

One day I signed up for X and discovered the indie hacker world  
That is when everything changed  
I built two SaaS projects, both failed

Then the idea for [MediaFast](http://MediaFa.st) came after I tried to do marketing on Reddit for those projects  
I lost four months and was banned six times  
I had no idea how to warm up accounts, choose the right subreddits, or post without sounding spammy

Once I finally figured out how to grow on Reddit, I thought  
""Why not help others with the same problem""

I did not validate anything  
I built the first version in three weeks  
Trained AI models  
Wrote the full backend prompt system to handle all use cases  
I wanted it to be something that cuts hours of research and prevents others from making the same mistakes I made

I shared the project on X three days before launch and got my first sale on day one  
I made $362 dollars the first month and I was super excited

Second month I made $765  
Third month I made over $1200  
Slow growth, but steady growth

After hitting the $1800 milestone in July, I set a goal  
Make 3000 dollars in a month

I failed three months in a row  
I got close every time  
$2300 in August  
$2700 in September  
$2800 in October

And finally in November  
I made $3000 dollars

Now [MediaFast](http://MediaFa.st) pays all my bills and gives me enough freedom to build more apps and create more income sources  
Thanks to it I moved to Spain as a student and it covers all my living costs  
I am grateful for that

All those no days off moments finally paid off

I remember a quote I once heard:  
""Sometimes you get lucky, and you cannot miss your lucky day if you try every day""",dartanyanyuzbashev,1par5fx,SideProject,30-11-2025,19:33:03,https://i.redd.it/vy3yijs45g4g1.jpeg
"MyAnimeList recommendations were garbage, so I scraped 108 years of history to build my own RAG engine. It searches by 'vibe' (e.g. 'rom-com anime with introverted protagonists who bond slowly') instead of tags.","https://reddit.com/link/1par4eo/video/ggsya90v2g4g1/player

I’ve been an anime fan for years, but I’ve always hated how hard it is to find new shows based on a specific feeling.

Searching for **""Romance""** usually gives you a generic mixed bag of harems and tragedies, not the specific dynamic you want.

In the video, I search for **'rom-com anime with introverted protagonists who bond slowly'**. Standard databases break with queries like that, but because my engine uses **Vector Search (RAG)**, it actually understands the character dynamic and finds matches like *Slow Start* and *Dress-Up Darling*.

I spent the last 2 months building **AiMi**.

The Tech Stack:

* **Backend:** FastAPI + Python
* **Search:** Hybrid RAG (Nomic v1.5 Embeddings + BM25 Keyword Boosting).
* **Logic:** I implemented **HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)** using a local LLM. It ""translates"" user queries (e.g., *""Anime without fanservice""*) into positive vector search terms (*""Wholesome, family friendly""*) so the results are actually accurate.
* **Frontend:** Streamlit with custom CSS.

**The ""Fun"" Part (Receipts):** I realized looking at data tables is boring, so I wrote a script using **Playwright** that visualizes your watch history as aesthetic **""Store Receipts""** to share on Instagram/Twitter.

I open-sourced a sample of the dataset (500 entries) on Kaggle if anyone wants to play with the data structure.

I’d love to hear what you guys think about the UI/UX. Does the ""Slider View"" feel smooth enough?

I made this little side project to deal with my own focus problems, and since it actually works, I figured I’d drop it here.

"We built an API/UI with 50+ custom styles to kill boring QR codes. Giving away 1,000 functional codes per month to every early user.","Hey r/sideproject,

We just launched **EagleBirth QR Code Generator**, an API and UI designed to solve one simple problem: **generic, ugly black QR codes are ruining great branding.**

We wanted a solution that gave developers and marketers total control over the aesthetic—so we built a platform offering over **50 unique style combinations**, including custom eyes, rounded patterns, gradients, and seamless logo embedding.

# Our Approach (and How to Use the Free Tier)

You can check out the design tool here: [https://eaglebirth.com/qr-code-generator](https://eaglebirth.com/qr-code-generator)

Our Product on Product Launch: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/eaglebirth-qr-api](https://www.producthunt.com/products/eaglebirth-qr-api)

1. **Free Preview:** You can go to the link above and design your perfect code for free. This acts as a visual preview to ensure you love the style—but it won't encode your data yet.
2. **The Unlock:** To get a **working, functional QR code** that correctly encodes your data (and to access the API), you simply need to sign up for a free account.
3. **The Free Offer:** Every user instantly gets **1,000 functional QR code generations every month**.

**To get started:** Sign up, navigate to the **Apps** section, **create an App** (your secure project folder), and then use the **QR Code Generator** within that App.

# For Developers

Our API is designed for zero-friction integration. You get a secure, signed HTML `embed_code` that requires **zero image hosting** on your end.

Find the complete documentation here:[https://eaglebirth.com/developer/documentation/qr-code-generator](https://eaglebirth.com/developer/documentation/qr-code-generator)

"Analyzed 1,000,000 Videos With My Own Tool","Hi everyone

I’m part of a small team that accidentally built something we now use every single day.

We kept running into the same problem: short-form video moves way too fast for any human to track. One niche pops for 48 hours, another collapses overnight, and by the time you manually check TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram… something else already went viral.

So we built a tool that just does that part for you.

You type a topic → Virlo scans the short-form universe across TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram → then gives you the breakout niches, viral formats, and top-performing videos tied to that topic. No endless scrolling, no relying on “vibes,” no guessing what’s trending in the dark.

We originally made it because we were tired of missing micro-surges (and warming up TikTok accounts manually) and wanted a better way to research content, campaigns, and trends without losing our minds.

We’ve been building quietly for a while, but it’s finally live: virlo.ai

It’s still early, still scrappy, and very much in motion… but it’s already become one of the most-used tools in our workflow, and I’m hoping it can help other creators, marketers, and founders who feel the same pain.

If you work in content or have to watch short-form trends for your business, I’d genuinely love your feedback. Happy to answer anything about how it works or what’s coming next.

IdeaSpot for iPhone - Feedback Please!,"First project that's actually made it to the App Store (currently in review so we'll see) so take it easy lmao.

At first glance it's just an AI wrapper (and it basically is). But it's solved a real problem for me & gave me a lot of good hands-on experience. I found that jumping around to a bunch of different niche's really confused my LLM's. And without super specific instructions I could never get a consistent stream of output for my ideas when jumping across topics quickly.

This could be a symptom of the User, not the LLM (probably is) but I wanted to create something regardless.

With IdeaSpot, the ideas are individually stored as notes you can edit, or quickly copy. There are currently 10 configurable outputs:

\- Specify Problem/Paint-Point

\- Find Target Customer

\- Market Size/Opportunity

\- Validation Plan

\- First Steps

\- Source Alternatives/Competitors

\- Minimum Feature Set

\- Risks/Challenges

\- Revenue Models

\- Key Features

I’ve been working on a series of small, minimal apps under the “Not Another App” idea, each one does a single task cleanly, without extra noise. My newest one is ""Not Another Stage Timer"", built for speakers, presenters, and performers who need a readable, distraction-free countdown during a talk or event.

* Full-screen countdown
* Large, high-contrast numbers
* Color-stage transitions (green → yellow → red)
* Portrait or landscape display
* No ads, no subscriptions, no login

Since it’s a paid app (one-time purchase), I know that makes casual testing harder — so if anyone here wants to try it out and give honest feedback, I have some free promo codes I can share. Just let me know  and I’ll DM you privately.

Struggling to get users for my sports analytics platform. What am I missing?,"I could use some real advice from people who have been through early stage user growth.

My cofounder and I built a sports analytics platform for casual bettors. We are fully bootstrapped and trying to grow it the scrappy way. The product works, people who use it seem to like it, and we put a lot of time into the scoring system and data model behind it.

The problem is getting actual users.

Right now I am promoting posts on Twitter and running small ad campaigns. I am getting clicks and impressions, but almost none of it is converting into real sign ups. I feel like I am burning money without learning anything. I have also tried posting on Twitter normally with graphics and prop analysis, but the traction is hit or miss.

I know this is a crowded space, but it is frustrating when people who actually try the platform say it is solid. I just cannot get enough people to try it in the first place.

For anyone who has grown a product like this, especially in a niche market, where should I be focusing? What channels worked for you when ads were not converting? Are there better ways to get in front of the right audience without paying for followers or clicks that go nowhere?

The app is already deployed (Android,IOS), and everything is functional.  
Revenue is **zero right now**, but the infrastructure is ready for someone who wants to build a med-ed brand or run paid quizzes/test series.

I’m shutting the project down due to shifting focus, and instead of letting it disappear, I’d love someone enthusiastic to take ownership and grow it.

If you're a:

* Medical tutor
* Coaching institute
* Content creator
* Developer wanting a ready-made edtech base

…this might be perfect for you.

I can share a demo video, screenshots, and full code overview.

The best way to explain this is with [example goals](https://www.overlord.app/community-goals/). Here's a few:

* ""Make sure I send a photo outside by 7am tomorrow, or lose $10""
* ""Block Instagram with these exceptions: 15 min with meal, 30 mins in gym, the whole night if I'm out after 11pm""
* ""Watch my Mac screen, and make sure I am focused on completing my homework by 11pm. Block anything unrelated to chemistry, and call me if I go off task""

We've been in Beta for the last year, with a small cohort of users from my previous app (Forfeit) invited. We're just about to launch, and I'd love to offer anyone from this free membership for the first month (usually $13/month).

"Everyone is ""unbundling"" Reddit/Twitter. I decided to ""rebundle"" the mental wellness stack into one private app.","Hey everyone,

I’m the solo founder behind **ThunDroid AI**.

I’ve been watching the ""Micro-SaaS"" space for a while, and the trend is usually to take one small feature and make it a standalone app.

But in the wellness space, I felt like this was actually hurting the user experience. I found myself paying for:

A Journaling SaaS.

A Breathing/Meditation App.

An AI Chatbot wrapper for venting.

It was fragmented and expensive.

So, for my side project turned startup, I decided to go the opposite direction: **Rebundling.**

I built a single, native iOS app that combines all three core pillars of emotional regulation:

**Cognitive:** A Smart Journal with 15+ structured categories.

**Emotional:** A 24/7 AI Companion (fine-tuned for empathy, not just generic answers).

**Physiological:** A library of 13+ pro breathing exercises (Wim Hof, Pranayama, Box Breathing).

**The Tech Constraint (The Hard Part):** I refused to take the easy route of storing user data on a cheap cloud database. I wanted this to be a ""Privacy-First"" app. So, I architected it to be **Local-First**.

All encryption happens on-device.

No user data is sent to my servers.

It runs offline (mostly) and feels snappy.

I just pushed a major update (v1.1.3) with a new ""Liquid Glass"" UI because I realized that for a wellness app, the *aesthetic* is actually a feature—it needs to feel calming instantly.

I’d love to get some feedback from other builders on the UI and the onboarding flow. It’s hard to judge your own work when you’ve been staring at the code for months.

I've been working on this project called F R A C T A L L A for a while now. Wanted to make something relaxing, maybe meditative, and creative - a way to zone out for a moment.

Would genuinely love feedback:

\- Actually relaxing or just chaotic?

\- Too complex or too simple?

\- What would make you come back to it?

I built an AI assistant that remembers everything you’ve seen on your computer,"I became tired of constantly copying and pasting context into ChatGPT, and re-explaining things to it. I was surprised that AI assistants have not become more personalized.

So I built Waylight, an AI assistant that already knows and understands your Google tabs, Zoom meetings, and Word documents.

Waylight creates a private, on-device memory of what you’ve viewed on your computer — your meetings, documents, tabs, messages, and more — so you can ask about anything you’ve seen and get instant, accurate answers.

Here are a few examples of what you can ask:  
\- “What did I agree to in that meeting yesterday?”  
\- “Summarize the PDF I had open earlier.”  
\- “Find the article I was reading last week.”  
\- “Summarize the tabs I had open during that research session.”

Waylight is 100% private; everything stays fully on your device, and nothing is uploaded or shared.

i made a free list of 100 places where you can promote your app,"I recently shared this on another subreddit and it got 500 upvotes so I thought I’d share it here as well, hoping it helps more people.

Every time I launch a new product, I go through the same annoying routine: Googling “SaaS directories,” digging up 5-year-old blog posts, and piecing together a messy spreadsheet of where to submit. It’s frustrating and time-consuming.

For those who don’t know launch directories are websites where new products and startups get listed and showcased to an audience actively looking for new tools and solutions. They’re like curated marketplaces or hubs for discovery, not just random link dumps.

It’s annoying to find a good list, so I finally sat down and built a proper list of launch directories: sites like Product Hunt, BetaList, StartupBase, etc. Ended up with 82 legit ones.

I also added a way to sort them by DR (Domain Rating) basically a metric (from tools like Ahrefs) that estimates how strong a website’s backlink profile is. Higher DR usually means the site has more authority and might pass more SEO value or get more organic traffic.

I turned it into a simple site: [launchdirectories.com](http://launchdirectories.com/)

No fluff, no paywall, no signups just the list I wish I had every time I launch something.

"Hot take: People don’t want career growth, they just want shortcuts. Prove me wrong.","Hey Reddit,  
I want to say something most founders never admit publicly: I’m exhausted

.  
Not because building an AI app is hard, it is. But because convincing people to care about their own growth is way harder than building the tech.

For the last year, we’ve been working on an app called Skillstr.

  
In simple terms:

* It helps working professionals build confidence, communication and presence in just a few minutes a day, the things that actually move careers upward.
* It scores your performance, gives feedback, and helps you be human in an AI-driven world.

Cool idea, right?

But here’s the part that broke me a little:  
No matter what we tried, people scrolled past it like it’s just another productivity hack.  
Like it’s a gym membership they’ll “start on Monday.”

That's when I realized something uncomfortable, something I didn’t want to admit:  
Most people say they want career growth.  
Very few actually want to face themselves.

Working on yourself, truly working, is uncomfortable, it’s vulnerable.  
It forces you to confront your weaknesses, not hide behind certificates and buzzwords.

Everyone wants a better job, a higher package, more respect.  
But almost nobody wants to spend even 5 minutes improving the one thing that decides promotions:  
How you communicate, think and lead when it matters.

To be honest, that realization hurt more than any startup failure.

But here’s the flip side: the people who do practice?  
They change fast, grow fast and become impossible to ignore at work.  
We’ve seen it with our early users.

And that’s why I’m here, on Reddit, where people are painfully honest and not impressed by flashy marketing.

If you’re someone who genuinely cares about growing, improving and becoming irreplaceable in an AI era, I’m happy to share more about what we’re building and let you in early. Just ask me in the comments.

If not, no worries. This isn’t for everyone.  
Growth never is.

We’re based in Bangalore, India and we’re building this for people who are serious.  
If you’re one of them, welcome.  
If not, thanks for reading anyway.

And if you think this whole thing is stupid, tell me.  
I’m here for the punches, not the praise.

"Mozika - Al Music Streaming , Endless Music Made For You","Hey guys, I’ve been working on a small music app that only plays AI made songs.

It doesn’t use the same old songs you hear everywhere everything is fresh and created by AI, so it doesn’t feel repetitive like normal music apps.

If you’re curious how AI music sounds, I’d really appreciate it if you could try it out and tell me what you think.

A private messenger app/website [need help],"First of all my idea is to build a private messenger that automatically deletes chats after exit or inactive for 5 mins. 
A terminal looking ui. 
Only 1 chat at a time 
No media. No calls. No particular reply to particular message. 
Connect users with a code or qr or link. 
Assign random usernames like reddit (eg non-persistant-designer, etc) everytime when chat connects.
Majorly, 2 page website it is one for connection amd other for chatting

I dont know if this exists, if yes no prob ill use for myself withon my friends group

Im thinking to host this in github pages  
I really dont even know anything about backend, i didnt self learn this.

I want to build this without any ai, vibecoding etc

Day 5 of my 20-day open-source challenge: FileFox — an AI tool that organizes messy folders for you,"I’m on **Day 5 of my 20-day open-source challenge**, where I ship one useful tool every day — fully open-source.

Today’s project is FoxFile 🦊

An AI-powered file organizer that takes in a messy folder and gives you back a clean, structured one.

# What FoxFile Does

Upload a **zip of any messy folder** — Downloads, Documents, Photos, Code, anything.

FoxFile will:



* Analyze all filenames, extensions, sizes, and metadata
* Understand the structure (or chaos)
* Detect duplicates
* Generate a full **organization plan**
* Sort files into smart folders (e.g. “Images → Screenshots / Photos”, “Documents → PDFs / Invoices”)
* Rename files cleanly & consistently
* Give you a downloadable **organized ZIP**
* Or a **script** to apply changes locally



It’s basically:



>“Turn my chaos into order.”



# Why I Built It

My Downloads folder hit **9,000+ files**, and no tool felt good enough:

* Most bulk renamers are old Windows apps from 2012
* Cloud tools want to upload everything (no thanks)
* AI tools exist but return a single zip with random naming logic
* And nothing shows a clear before/after plan



So FoxFile does:

**→ Privacy-first** (files not stored long-term)

**→ BYOK AI via OpenRouter** (use any model you want)

**→ Clear before/after** folder comparison

**→ Fast, no signup required for small folders**

# Core Features

* Drag in a messy folder (ZIP)
* AI builds a **proposed organization plan**
* See a before vs after folder tree
* Download clean results
* Or run a script locally
* Duplicate detection
* Enforced limits for free users (50 files, etc.)
* Clean, minimal UI

# Tech Stack

* Next.js
* Convex
* Clerk
* Tailwind
* OpenRouter for AI (BYOK)

# You could add:



* Image EXIF-based sorting
* Music metadata grouping
* Document classification (invoices, receipts, IDs, etc.)
* Custom organization presets
* Local-only mode



If you try it, tell me where it breaks — edge cases, weird file types, naming patterns, or anything confusing. Feedback is gold during this challenge.

I built my own AI workspace as a solo founder — sharing it here for FREE,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been building my own AI workspace from scratch as a solo founder, and I finally shipped a feature that genuinely made my own workflow 10x better. Thought I’d share it here for completely free.



Sudosu is something I built because I was tired of juggling 10 tabs, copying content between tools, and trying to fit my messy thoughts into a tiny chat window. Everything felt scattered.



So I built a canvas-based AI workspace where:

**You can drag & drop anything — blogs, PDFs, YouTube links, full videos, screenshots, notes — and the entire canvas becomes your AI context.**

Here's the link : [https://trysudosu.com](https://trysudosu.com)

And yes, you can run **all the Google models** inside it (Gemini Flash, Pro, Imagen, etc.) because I integrated them directly. No need to jump between interfaces.



Just drop everything in and start creating.

A PM friend tested this yesterday:

1. Dropped screenshots of his app’s onboarding flow
2. Added a couple of user session recordings
3. Pasted last month’s user feedback notes
4. Linked a YouTube usability test video



Then he asked:



>“Can you analyze all of this and generate a complete user journey report with gaps, friction points, and recommendations?”



The agent stitched everything together:

→ mapped the onboarding steps

→ highlighted drop-off moments

→ spotted confusing copy

→ identified duplicate steps

→ suggested a cleaner flow

→ generated a final “User Journey Insights Report” like a real PM deck



He literally said:

*“I usually do this across Notion + Miro + Sheets. This took 3 minutes.”*

  
Here are more such things you can do

* Writing PRDs from screenshots + notes
* Planning 7-day content calendars from YouTube videos
* Turning blogs + PDFs + images into case studies
* Summarizing long videos into point-wise insights
* Generating diagrams, architectures, flowcharts
* Using Google’s multimodal models directly inside the canvas



All free right now because I want people to try it and tell me what’s broken.

I’m still early, still shipping daily, still making mistakes — but if tools like this excite you, I’d love for you to try it.

"I got tired of those ""Solo-Leveling"" apps in playstore, so ive built my own. No ads, No purchases, real discipline, real consequences. Need honest feedback and ideas.","Hello guys, so a few weeks ago I have seen those SOLO LEVELING apps in the play store and i was so disappointed by how they turned out to be, so i decided developed my own one with better features and more effective ways overall. No ads, No purhcases, just an app to help improve peoples lifes. ive been developing this app for a few weeks now as a hobby, but with actual life improvement instead of an ad filled app. for example, when you miss a daily quest; it blocks all the non-system apps for the whole NEXT DAY. and i made it like non bypassable unless you delete the app (no matter what you do, even if you kill the process it restarts every itself every single minute), and it doesnt even use the accessibility permission. Anyways, let me talk about the app overall. When you register, you enter your max consecutive push up count (so in the dungeons and gates it can give you a personalised workout for everyone.), and the first thing you see in the app is the menu where the main things reside. in ""STATUS"", you can see your stats, title, name, physical status and achievements. in ""DAILY QUEST"" you have to complete a daily quest everyday to not get a penalty quest that blocks every app for the next day. (Currently the daily quest is ""at least 10 minutes activity workout"" and ""100 minutes reading/studying."". But this is just a placeholder for now, i will make it that it will change according to the user. Everyday you finish the daily quest you get xp, stats and you add a day to your streak. In the third section ""gates"" there will be 2 options, daily dungeons and weekly dungeons. daily dungeons will be unlocked from the sstart, and it will give the user a random workout with personalised difficulty, its pretty easy, and the quicker you finish, the more rewards you get. But i really like weekly gates/dungeons, it unlocks when the player reaches level 5, and it selects 3 random dungeons/gates from the database. this time some of these arent even about workout, and all of them have badass names,  ""Ice Monarchs Domain"", ""Chamber of Silence"", ""Library of the Ascended mind"" and etc. i dont want to spoil it all, but let me just tell this, it gives full random things that help you improve yourself like a very hard workout, meditation, studying/reading, cold shower, and etc. the quicker you finish, the more rewards you get on this one too. Ive also made a notification system that sends random notificationsthrought the day or week according to your proggress and activity. Oh, and also the app saves everything to the cloud, so you dont have to worry about losing progress or anything. Im planning to improve the app with all of your feedbacks and eventually release it in play store. (I will not put ads, coding is my hobby, not job. and also, i know im not that good of a coder or app designer, but thats why im here. to get feedback.). Im looking for brutally honest opinions and thoughts about the app so far and ideas. Thanks.

the app uses ""Appear on top"", ""UsageStats manager"", ""Notifications"" permissions as of now.

I made an AI agent that watches Twitch streams and auto-clips them into TikToks (Python + Computer Vision),"Hi everyone!

I built a tool called [VIRLai](https://virlai.vercel.app/) because I was tired of seeing streamers lose growth opportunities.

**How it works:**

1. **Ingests Stream:** Downloads audio/video from a Twitch VOD.

3. **Auto-Edit:** Uses Computer Vision (YOLO) to detect the streamer's face and the gameplay, then stacks them into a 9:16 vertical video. It even has ""Smart Dodge"" to fix layout issues when the facecam covers the game UI.

"I analyzed the Top 100 AI tools on Toolify. They aren't winning on ""Features""—they are winning on ""User Paths"". (How I finally got my first sale after 3 failures)","I wanted to share a small win and a big lesson I learned recently.

I’ve been building AI products since April. I launched three different tools back-to-back. I did what most devs do: I grinded on code, added more models, and stacked up features. **The result? Zero revenue.**

I stopped coding and decided to do some research. I scraped and analyzed the **Top 100 AI products on Toolify**. I wanted to know what they had that I didn't.

**1. The ""Feature Trap"" vs. The ""Conversion War""** I expected to see complex, groundbreaking tech stacks. Instead, I found a pattern: **The profitable tools don't compete on functionality; they compete on conversion.**

They don't force users to think. They know exactly what the user wants (the ""Aha!"" moment) and they remove every single micro-barrier between the user and that value. Their user paths are slippery slides—you click once, and you are already at the destination.

I realized I was fighting the wrong war. I was trying to build ""more,"" while they were building ""easier.""

**2. The Reality Check (My ""Stupid"" Mistake)** Armed with this insight, I looked at my own failed projects using Clarity. I wanted to see where my ""User Path"" was broken.

It was embarrassing. I saw users on mobile furiously clicking the text **""Sign in to start.""** Nothing happened. The actual login button was hidden in a sidebar menu.

In my head, the user should ""explore the UI."" In reality, the user just wanted to start. I was increasing their **""Decision Radius""**—forcing them to hunt for a button instead of just giving it to them.

I fixed it immediately. Now, clicking that text pops the login modal. Zero friction.

**3. The First Sale & The New Philosophy** Shortly after shifting my mindset from ""Building Features"" to ""Smoothing Paths,"" I got my first Stripe notification. It wasn't huge money, but it validated the theory: **Business is just ""Goods finding People."" Your job is to clear the road between them.**

**4. Applying this to my new project** I’m now applying this ""Conversion First"" philosophy to my 4th project, [AI Comic Studio](https://animalgenerator.net/comic-studio).

Most AI tools force users to struggle with complex prompts to get the right camera angle or keep a face looking the same. That's friction.

So I stripped away the confusing settings and focused on combining **Smart Layouts** with **Character Consistency**. The path is now dead simple: *Pick a Layout (Structure) -> Upload Character (Identity) -> Get Comic.*

No prompting for camera angles. No morphing faces. Just the story.

If you are stuck at $0 MRR, stop adding features. Go look at your user path. Is it a slippery slide, or an obstacle course?

but yeah. first real validation that i'm not just building for myself.

if you're procrastinating on shipping like i was for years... just ship it. 

doesn't have to be perfect. someone out there probably needs it.

anyway. back to building.

• Analyzes your business → creating a business profile for blog context  
• Performs keyword/SEO research→ writes full 1,000 to 3,000 word SEO-optimized article  
• Adds proper H1/H2, meta description, internal links, etc.  
• Automatic publishing to Wordpress (or a custom webhook endpoint)

I have attached a demo video to this post (more can be seen on the site)

I am going into early access on Monday December 1st (tomorrow) with 50% off for the first 3 months for those on the wailtist

Would love brutal feedback, does this actually solve your blogging pain? What’s missing?

Celebrating 1200 registered users on my first app 🥳,"A bit more than a year ago, I finished my PhD in psychology. During my PhD I struggled with the usual: procrastination, rabbit holes, impostor syndrome, working too much some days and not enough on others.

I cycled through Notion, Obsidian, Todoist, TickTick, Habitica, Toggl... never found one that actually fit how my brain works. They all gave me data without meaning. *I* had to make them useful.

So I built my own app.

The app is called [**Orakemu**](http://www.orakemu.com) (from Māori: ""ora"" = life, ""kemu"" = game). It's a slightly gamified life tracker and daily planner, but the core idea is different from most productivity apps:

**Instead of organizing by projects, you organize by Life Roles.**

Think of it like an RPG for your actual life. You're not just a ""worker"" — you're a Parent, a Creator, a Friend, a Career Warrior, someone trying to *Be a Functional Adult*. Each role can have its own tasks, habits, and time tracked. You finally see your whole life in one place and can make conscious choices about where to invest your energy.

**What's in the app now:**

* Life Roles with XP progression and stats over time
* Drag-and-drop daily timeline
* Time-blocking and time-tracking *everything* (with notes, so it doubles as a journal)
* Flexible habits, routines, and saved checklists
* Tasks and basic projects

**Coming soon:** Notifications, calendar sync, and a ""Orakemu Wrapped"" at the end of the year. And much more to come :)

The crazy part for me is that I got users from all over the world: Japan, India, Canada, Australia, Europe, etc.

And even though reaching 1200 users organically isn't a groundbreaking achievement, I think it's a great start.

1,200 people who want to be more intentional with their time!

Still a long way to go, but I'm proud of what the app is becoming.

Happy to answer questions about the solo dev journey or the app itself!",xogno,1pajbfp,SideProject,30-11-2025,14:16:36,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pajbfp
SEO growth timeline: 0 to 1800 visitors in 6 months with monthly breakdowns,"Launched new site in May tracking every SEO metric to understand actual growth patterns versus theories. Six months later at 1800 monthly organic visitors. Sharing detailed month-by-month progression with specific tactics executed and results.​

Starting conditions were brand new domain with zero authority, no backlinks, no content. Goal was reaching 1500+ monthly visitors within 6 months using sustainable tactics. Tracked everything in spreadsheet correlating actions with results.​

Month one execution focused on foundation. Submitted to 200+ directories via [directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org) establishing baseline authority. Set up Search Console and Analytics. Researched 40 low-competition keywords. Published 5 foundational posts. Results: Domain authority 0→10, traffic 18 visitors, zero keywords ranking.​

Month two showed directory backlinks starting to index. Published 7 posts targeting longtail keywords. Created internal linking structure. Updated month one posts with additional content. Results: Domain authority 10→16, traffic 110 visitors, 6 keywords ranking positions 20-40.​

Month three hit early traction phase. Published 8 posts. Earlier content from month one moved to pages 2-3. Started appearing for more keywords. Results: Domain authority 16→21, traffic 340 visitors, 14 keywords ranking, 4 in top 20.​

Month four showed acceleration. Published 6 posts plus updated 8 older posts with fresh information. Content from months 1-2 ranking page one for longtail terms. Results: Domain authority 21→25, traffic 680 visitors, 24 keywords ranking, 9 in top 20, 3 in top 10.​

Month five maintained momentum. Published 5 posts, updated 6 older posts. The compound effect really visible with earlier content performing well. Results: Domain authority 25→28, traffic 1140 visitors, 35 keywords ranking, 16 in top 20, 8 in top 10.​

Month six crossed goal. Published 4 posts, updated 5 older posts. Now ranking for 51 keywords total. Some posts individually getting 80+ visitors monthly. Results: Domain authority 28→31, traffic 1800 visitors, 51 keywords ranking, 23 in top 20, 12 in top 10.​

Key growth tactics that worked were directory submissions establishing DA 0→16 in first two months creating foundation, consistent publishing 4-8 posts monthly never skipping, targeting longtail keywords with clear search intent, updating older posts as they gained traction adding value, building internal linking connecting related content, and being patient through months 1-3 when growth seemed slow.​

The inflection point analysis showed months 1-2 are pure foundation building with minimal visible results, month 3 is typically when earlier content starts ranking, month 4 is acceleration phase as compound effects kick in, and months 5-6 show exponential growth as content library performs.​

For others tracking SEO growth the lessons are track monthly metrics correlating actions with results, invest in foundation early even when results aren't visible, maintain consistent publishing beating sporadic bursts, update older content as it gains traction, and give it full 90 days minimum before evaluating if tactics work.",Appropriate-Pie-3634,1paj8o3,SideProject,30-11-2025,14:13:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1paj8o3/seo_growth_timeline_0_to_1800_visitors_in_6/
Woke up to another payment… this still doesn’t feel real 🤯,"I woke up this morning, and saw another payment come through for Launchli.  
  
Still does not feel real.  
  
Two months ago this was just a tiny experiment I built out of curiosity, a full-stack distribution platform that learns your tone, creates content for you, schedules it everywhere, and gives you SEO keywords your product can rank for.  
  
Basically: you focus on building → it handles the visibility.   
  
And now people are actually signing up for it.

What’s wild is none of this came from a big launch or ads. It came from showing up daily, posting honest progress, and letting the momentum compound on its own.

It’s still tiny, but every time Stripe pings my phone it feels like a spark. Like, “okay… maybe this is actually working.”

Anyway, just wanted to share the win.   
  
Momentum is a crazy thing, it starts slow and then suddenly you feel it.   
  
If you’re building something and stuck in that quiet phase, keep going.  
Your first few users hit way harder than you expect.

It took me 5 months to reach 1k in revenue.,"Last year I started building [**ui-layouts.com**](http://ui-layouts.com) as a simple open-source UI library.  
No business plan. No monetization strategy. Just curiosity + excitement to build something useful.

For a long time it was just a hobby, push updates, add blocks, improve styling, talk with early users.  
After about a year, I finally decided to launch a [Pro version](https://pro.ui-layouts.com/) with extra templates and more polished components.

I wasn’t expecting much.  
But slowly, the first sale came. Then another. Then more.

After **5–6 months**, I crossed **$1,000 in revenue**.  
  
For many people that might be small, but for me it was huge, it proved someone found real value in what I built.  
It felt *unreal*.

# Things I did right (at least I think so):

* Shipped consistently, even when growth was slow
* Kept the UI blocks clean, simple, and developer-friendly
* Didn’t over-engineer — focused on solving real problems
* Treated it like a long-term project, not a quick win
* Stayed open-source first, so people could trust and try it

# What’s next?

I’m building something bigger now, a **shadcn template builder**.  
The idea is to let you visually assemble pages like Lego blocks:

* Choose a **Hero**
* Add **About** section
* Drop in **Pricing + Testimonials + FAQ**
* Drag to reorder visually
* Export as a complete template (clean code)
* *(Optional)* one-click repo + deployment in future

Basically: **build a full page in minutes, not hours.**

  
If anyone here has:

* feedback
* feature ideas
* UI suggestions
* or wants to try it

I’d love to hear your thoughts.",Silent-Group1187,1paix2j,SideProject,30-11-2025,13:58:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1paix2j/it_took_me_5_months_to_reach_1k_in_revenue/

How to Sell AI agents and Automation Workflows,"Hello guys I have been selling Automations particularly in Marketing segments and these are stuff I have noticed : 

Selling is hard Building the product doesn’t take that much time Business don’t need AI agents they need proper services which solves their problem Yes the market is expanding

But the most frustrating part is it’s hard to sell really only working methods is LinkedIn cold outreach or like cold emails but on a average you get only 5 out of 100 emails u get back some response and it’s time consuming and most marketplaces get 10-30% commissions which eats your profits “selling something doesn’t have to feel so hard”

I am building a AI agents marketplace and automation  and this is a ZERO COMMISSION marketplace and an ecosystem we make any commission out of the products that u sell. Best part we bring the customers to you and we already have 15 business who are ready to like post custom requests

We are on Early access program right now people can join us and gets exclusive perks : https://miribly.com/

Building it for the community won’t be similar to other marketplaces even if u are a beginner you have a fair chance of making and selling your builds

If you got any queries and questions regarding anything kindly comment or dm me I am happy to answer and we are building in public so even a feedback would help us a lot . Thank you for reading this",Bulky_Mail5361,1paik90,SideProject,30-11-2025,13:41:19,https://miribly.com/

Built my first full-stack trading simulator - would love feedback on architecture and UX,"Hey r/SideProject! I just shipped my first proper web app after \~2 weeks of work.

What it is: Portfole - a paper trading platform where you practice stock trading with zero friction. (A papertrading site is basically a site where only fake money is involved, in order to learn).

The problem: Every paper trading platform I found was either locked behind signup walls, had premium paywalls, or was unnecessarily complex. I wanted something you could just... start using.

How it works:

\- Open [portfole.com](http://portfole.com) → Set a budget → Start trading immediately - No account creation, no email, no premium tiers

\- Everything saves in localStorage  
\- Live mode: Real market data via Finnhub API (Currently)  
\- Practice mode: Simulated stocks when markets are closed (so you can test it right now even outside trading hours)

Tech Stack:

\- Frontend: React (single-page app)  
\- Backend: Python Flask on Railway  
\- API: Finnhub for real-time stock data  
\- Storage: localStorage (no database needed)  
\- Hosting: Hostinger

What I'm looking for:

1. Architecture feedback - Is there a better way to handle the real-time updates? Currently polling every 10s
2. UX issues - Does anything feel clunky or confusing?
3. Feature requests - What would make this actually useful?
4. Load testing - I genuinely have no idea how it'll behave with multiple concurrent users (Railway free tier + Finnhub rate limits) This is my first time building something strangers might actually use, so honest feedback would be incredibly helpful.

I'm building an AI layer to fact-check Instagram Reels and TikToks because algorithms prioritize virality over truth.,"Short-form video is the primary source of information for millions, yet it strips away all nuance and citations. Verification requires leaving the app and breaking the flow, so nobody does it.

I built an MVP to automate this ""sanity check.""

**How it works:**

1. **Share:** You are watching a Reel/TikTok/Short that makes a bold claim. You share the link to this app.
2. **Analyze:** The AI extracts audio and visual text, then performs a grounded Google Search to cross-reference the claims against indexed sources.
3. **Result:** It returns a confidence score (Verified/Questionable/Debunked) and, crucially, provides the missing context and direct source links.

**The Goal:** This isn't an ""absolute truth"" arbiter. The objective is to reduce the friction of research. It provides immediate context to prevent misinformation from settling as fact.

I am looking for feedback on the utility of this workflow. Would you use a ""context button"" for your social feed?

I built a place where “wantrepreneurs” can browse real pain points to build for,"I’ve noticed a pattern among friends (and myself):

it’s of course *way* easier to start a venture if you already have a clear problem to solve… but a lot of people who want to be founders are the opposite. They’re excited to build *something*, and only then go hunting for a real problem.

I kept getting the same question:

>“I want to build a startup, but I don’t know what problem to solve.”

Yes, there are ideas and complaints scattered all over Reddit, Twitter, forums, etc. But there isn’t one focused place where **pain points and potential solutions meet**.

So I put together a small MVP: [**https://www.solvemypainpoint.com/**](https://www.solvemypainpoint.com/)

SolveMyPainPoint lets you:

* Submit a pain point in a structured way (what’s the problem, how painful, which category).
* See how many others share the same issue and how they experience it.
* Add or discover existing solutions/products when they exist.
* Spot *unsolved* problems that might actually be worth building for.

It’s a scrappy side project (very much MVP), but I’d love feedback from this sub:

* As a **builder**, would you use this to look for ideas?
* What would make it genuinely useful (filters, notifications, tags, “problems of the week”, etc.)?
* Anything obviously missing or confusing?

Also: if you have a pain point you keep ranting about, I’d really appreciate if you submit it and tell me how the flow feels😊

Roast my idea: Am I giving human psychology too much credit? (TikTok for Education),"I’m looking for honest feedback on a platform idea I’m exploring.

**The Problem: ""Doom Scrolling Guilt""**

We all doom scroll on TikTok/Reels. It feels good in the moment, but we often feel like trash afterward because we didn't learn anything. On the flip side, we want to learn, but 2-hour video courses or 40-page eBooks feel like ""homework.""

**The Solution:**

I want to build a ""TikTok for Carousels"" (I know, ""TikTok for X"" is a cliché, but it describes the UX perfectly). 

Think of the educational PDF carousels you see on LinkedIn (5-10 slides, bite-sized tactical value), but in a dedicated mobile app designed for binge-learning, not networking.

* **UX:** Vertical scroll to discover new topics → Horizontal scroll to read the specific lesson.
* **The Content:** Starting with **Sales & Marketing** (high-value, tactical content).
* **For Creators:** Currently, carousel creators get likes but $0. This platform lets them gate content.

**Proposed Monetization:**  
""Freemium Slides.""

* Slides 1-3 are free (The Hook).
* Slide 4-10 are locked.
* User pays to unlock the rest + get downloadable templates.

**I need your help with 3 specific debates:**

1. **The Psychology:** Am I giving people too much credit? Do people actually want to learn in their spare time, or do they just say they do but actually prefer mindlessly watching cat videos?
2. **Ads vs. Micropayments:** As a user, would you rather:
   * **A)** Pay small amounts (e.g., $0.50) to unlock a specific guide?
   * **B)** Pay a flat sub (e.g., $5/mo) for unlimited access?
   * **C)** Get it for free, but have Ads inserted between slides?
3. **The Format:** Is the ""Tiktok Carousel"" format actually a good learning method, or is there another delivery format you would recommend?

Roast the idea - I’d rather know it’s bad now than in 6 months.

Building a Pay-Per-Credit Second Number — Would Love Your Input,"We’re building a simple pay-per-credit second-number tool -- [supadial.com](http://supadial.com)  
  
Our goal is to help freelancers, students, founders, and nomads who don’t want extra SIMs, full phone plans, or clunky subscriptions. Many just want a second number that works on the phone they already have, with no contract and no monthly commitment.



The idea is pretty simple:

• Pay-as-you-go credits

• A virtual number people can call you on

• Make and receive real calls anywhere

• Clean dashboard with call history + controls

• No second device, no plan, no lock-in

• We’re giving early users free credits so they can try it with zero pressure

It’s lightweight on purpose. No big suite, no bloat. Just “credits in, calls out.”

We’re still early, so we’re trying to learn as much as we can from people who’ve dealt with second-number or call-management headaches.

Two things we’d genuinely love feedback on:

Any tips on getting the first meaningful signups or engagement for a tool like this? Especially from people who’ve launched something utility-based.

If you’ve used Google Voice, Hushed, OpenPhone, second SIMs, eSIMs, whatever — what’s one thing you feel they’re missing or overcomplicating? We don’t want to reinvent what already works, just fill the gaps.

Any honest thoughts (good or harsh) are massively appreciated.",SupaDial,1pah9nd,SideProject,30-11-2025,12:35:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pah9nd/building_a_paypercredit_second_number_would_love/
My video editing app I made to solve my own problem got first paid user!,"This is my first app, and I have never launched any apps for like 2 or 3 years. Always stuck in development, so getting that first paid user validated that i'm doing something right!

  
The app basically solves my own problem, of being too lazy to cut out all of the silences in my videos. The app does it automatically for me, plus adds subtitles for my TikTok and insta content. 

For me to fully finish this app I need to prepare for a MacOS launch of my application, there are some incompatibilties between Appkit and UIKit, so im looking into fixing that.

There's more features that i have to implement eventually, since my workload for video editing still requires a couple of features to be feature complete for me :)

I got shadowbanned 3 times trying to grow my startup on Reddit. So I built ReddiFlow.,"Like many of you, I tried using Reddit to grow my business. But I kept making rookie mistakes:

\- Posted the same content too frequently

\- Ignored subreddit-specific rules

\- Posted at terrible times

After my 3rd shadowban, I decided to build ReddiFlow - a Reddit scheduler that actually understands subreddit rules and prevents you from getting banned.

🚀 \*\*What it does:\*\*

\- Validates posts against subreddit rules before scheduling

\- Suggests optimal posting times for each community  

\- Prevents spam with intelligent 2-hour gaps

\- AI-powered content optimization

Am I the only one spending 5+ hours customizing resumes and filling forms for EACH application?,"**tl;dr** \- I'm building a tool to automate repetitive job application stuff for freshers. Before I dive in, want to validate if this is actually a problem YOU face.

# Here's what I've observed:

When applying for companies, you end up:

1. **Filling the SAME information across 10+ company forms**
   * ""Tell us about yourself"" → Same answer, typed 10 times
   * ""Describe your projects"" → Copy-pasting the same projects differently for each company
   * ""What challenges did you face?"" → Same project, different wording for each form
2. **Writing company-specific content every single time**
   * Different resume for different companies (tailoring keywords)
   * Custom cover letter for EVERY application
   * Different ""why this company"" answers
3. **Time sink**
   * 30-45 min per application (form filling + resume tailoring + cover letter)
   * 10 applications = 5-7 hours
   * Multiply by everyone in your batch = massive time waste

and we have came across many situation where while applying for a job we have been asked  about the projects  
Eg: ""have u worked on  X  system?"" , "" how have u approached for this project or how will u?

where i might have projects based on that, but i wont remember it at that time

comment ""YES"" if u have faced that problem or else ""NO""

this would help me to validate my idea",HugeProblem4669,1pagoyj,SideProject,30-11-2025,12:03:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pagoyj/am_i_the_only_one_spending_5_hours_customizing/

I built a verified knowledge base that makes Cursor and Claude Code more accurate - 100 free lifetime Pro licenses,"**The problem:** AI coding assistants guess on specific technical questions. ""PostgreSQL timeout is around 30 seconds"" - it's actually infinite by default. ""Next.js redirects use 307"" - Server Actions use 303. Small errors that waste hours debugging.

**How it works:**

* Add our MCP server to Cursor or Claude Code (one line of config)
* AI automatically queries AgentsKB for technical questions
* Gets verified answer instead of guessing

**Tech stack:**

* Backend: Python/FastAPI
* Vector DB: Qdrant
* Frontend: Astro
* Answer generation: Claude Opus + web search ($0.12/answer for quality)

**Current coverage:** PostgreSQL (553 Q&As), Next.js, TypeScript, React, FastAPI, Prisma, Docker, Kubernetes, and 100+ more domains.

"After years of tab chaos, I finally built my own solution","**The problem:** 

I'm a browser hopper. Browser-native sync is useless when you switch between browsers, or use different browsers on desktop and mobile.

I tried other tab managers, but none of them stuck. I always end up with endless tabs open, afraid to close them in case I need them later. Finding the right tab becomes a nightmare, and they eat resources.

**My solution:** 

[tabhaven](https://tabhaven.com) \- a web-based tab manager with real-time sync.

**What I needed:**

* Temporary saves, not permanent bookmark graveyards
* Nested groups for proper organization
* Workspaces to keep work and personal tabs separate
* Real-time sync across all devices
* Search that actually finds things
* Shareable collections for sending links to others
* Password protection for sensitive folders and shares

It's a web app that works in any browser - no extension required. Browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox flavors are available for convenience - save tabs with a keyboard shortcut or right-click menu, search from your address bar.

"After 22 years chasing clients and a trip to the ER, I’m building apps that work while I sleep. Here’s my journey from custom electronics, to desserts, to indie developer.","After 22 years of chasing clients, I’ve decided to become an indie developer creating useful software and apps. I’m fascinated by this business model. The MRR and ARR approach is the way forward.
Last year I ended up in the ER with severe chest pain. That moment changed everything about how I think about work, income, and my future. But let me back up and tell you how I got here.

Back in 2014, I ran a small custom electronics installation company with 10 guys on payroll. We were making a great living, but I was burned out from constantly chasing the next client and running down builders. Eventually, I sold the business and shifted gears entirely.

In 2015, I moved to another state where I knew no one to open a dessert shop. Yes, I went from tech to food, and no, I’d never worked in a restaurant. To say I didn’t know what the hell I was doing is an understatement, but I had a vision, and as an entrepreneur, I was going for it. The food industry isn’t for the faint of heart. What looks easy as a customer is daunting and exhausting, though rewarding at the same time. Success in food is directly tied to the economy and your location.

By 2018, I had the dessert business dialed in, so I decided to reopen a custom electronics installation company while keeping the dessert shop running. I figured I could work both part-time. This time I kept it small. Working alone, keeping 100% of the profits. It’s worked so far. I enjoy it way more without employees relying on my hustle for their paychecks. It’s hard work, but enjoyable and profitable.

Then last year, I went to the ER with severe chest pain and found out I have cardiovascular disease. Scary stuff. After multiple tests, meds, diet changes, and lifestyle adjustments, I realized I needed monthly recurring revenue and needed to work from home more. But I honestly didn’t know what could make that possible.

Around March this year, my son introduced me to vibe coding. Wait, I could build software and apps using AI? I gave it a shot, entered a few prompts, and got shit results. I expected to type a few commands and, voilà, an app would emerge. Not that simple, big guy. Too busy to deal with it, I shelved the idea.

A few months later, I decided I really needed to try again. I needed to build software that would free me from relying on physical labor. I needed to generate revenue day and night, and software was the key. I just had to figure it out.

Vibe coding turned out to be a genuine skill that required practice to create real products people actually want. I started by making software for my existing businesses and learned a ton in the process, all while AI continued advancing its coding and reasoning capabilities. A few months ago, I decided to build something others could benefit from that could earn me some MRR.

I started small with BillSnap, a super easy way to manage bills and ensure you pay them on time. As an entrepreneur juggling multiple businesses, I get too busy to track everything, and if bills aren’t on autopay, I forget them. BillSnap helps me track bills, sends alerts, and generates a monthly calendar so I can see what’s due and mark things paid. Simple and effective.

Building the initial concept was easy. Fine-tuning every screen, every workflow, every button press, that’s where the real time gets spent. I understand what MVP means, but I need to launch something actually worth using, and if my name is on it, it should be done well. Even for a simple app like BillSnap, I went through at least 23 iterations before I was happy with it. Once finished, I decided to make it available in multiple languages and currencies. I’d come this far. Why not?

The Apple App Store was another learning curve. They’d catch little issues. A screen that didn’t display right on an iPad Air running iOS 16.6, for example. I went through several rounds of this. How am I supposed to test for every scenario? But I get it. Apple has high standards, and so do I. Things need to be great.

After several rounds, I was finally approved, and my app went live this past Friday. It’s an incredibly exciting feeling to have an app published on Apple. I don’t personally know anyone else who’s done this. Now the question is: how do I get people to download and try it? I’ve already shared it on my personal Facebook, LinkedIn, and here on Reddit. Time will tell how well it does, but even if I only generate a few hundred dollars a month, it’s still a success.

Now you may be thinking, “All you built was an app that helps people pay bills on time? Boring!” Maybe so, but it was a huge learning experience. And guess what? I’m not done yet.

While building and launching BillSnap, I started developing other apps simultaneously. I’m waiting on Apple to approve my second app, GAUGE, an AI-driven app that helps men dress better without overthinking it. It helps us assemble outfits for any occasion using our own closet, ensuring everything matches perfectly. If you need something new, GAUGE can recommend clothing that’ll fit and look good. Since it’s on your phone, it’s also your shopping companion, helping you pick the right shirt, blazer, and accessories.

I can easily design elaborate automation systems for homes and businesses, but I can’t figure out what clothes match when I need to dress nice for an event. GAUGE has been a game changer for me. I recently used it at Macy’s for a business event I was attending. Since I had my wardrobe loaded up, I was able to find a blazer and shoes that matched pants and a shirt I already owned. It even gave me advice on which socks would match best. I hope other guys will benefit from it too. 

But I’m not done yet. I’m currently building a fitness app and online platform. Fitness is important to me, and I’ve used many complicated exercise apps. So I decided to build one that’s super easy, super intuitive, and automatically creates workout plans for you. I’m about a month away from launching it. More to come on this and the other apps I’m developing.

The goal isn’t to build the next unicorn startup. It’s to create genuinely useful tools that generate enough MRR to give me location independence and time freedom. And honestly? For the first time in 22 years, I’m building something that works while I sleep.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

If you’ve made it this far, thanks for sticking around and I appreciate your feedback on the apps. God bless. ",FinancialRaspberry32,1pag008,SideProject,30-11-2025,11:22:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pag008/after_22_years_chasing_clients_and_a_trip_to_the/

Rebuilt my whole product in like a weekend using a SaaS boilerplate lol,"the wild part is how much the boilerplate is doing for me. auth flows, org/user management, subscriptions, billing, dashboards, settings pages are all basically plug‑and‑play. I’ve got things like role‑based access, team workspaces, and usage‑based billing wired up without me touching half the underlying glue code, which is awesome but also kinda means I’m trusting a lot of magic I didn’t write.

my biggest worry now is whether I’m leaning too hard on all this turnkey stuff and accidentally creating some weird Franken‑architecture that’s gonna bite me later. right now it’s Next.js app router + server actions, Supabase for auth and row‑level security, Stripe webhooks for billing, background jobs for async tasks, and a bunch of prebuilt dashboard UI wired together with shared layouts/hooks. do I just keep everything as is and ride the speed, or should I start ripping out pieces and rewriting bits so I actually understand every layer and can tweak it for a tiny product?

if anyone here likes poking holes in systems, I’d honestly love to hear where you’d expect this setup to collapse first. is the risk more on the vendor lock‑in side (Supabase/Stripe), the complexity of the boilerplate itself, or the fact that I shipped without deeply understanding all the abstractions? I’m genuinely trying to level up my architecture brain because right now it feels like I duct‑taped speed onto tech debt.

feel free to roast it, I’m not precious about it at all. I’ll DM anyone who goes deep so we can nerd out more about tradeoffs, especially if you’ve shipped with a similar boilerplate stack.

Then, while browsing Reddit, I saw many other solo devs looking for testers in a similar way. Generally, the posts were based on the logic of ""test my app, and I'll test yours.""

Also, in these posts, users were only aiming to complete the 12-person test group. But they had no idea if these 12 people were actually testing their apps. So I said, ""Why isn't there an app for this?"" and I built an app called App Hive to enable developers who need a 12-person test team to come together and test each other's apps.

The logic is very simple. 14 people come together and form a group. They join a ""Hive"" in the app. When 14 people are completed, the Hive switches to active testing status, and everyone in the Hive tests the other 13 apps.

Daily tasks to test other users' apps are automatically assigned to everyone. The system warns users who don't complete tasks, and if they continue, it kicks them out of the Hive and informs other users. This way, only people who actually test can access real testing.

It has been about 1 month since the first release of the app, and about 2 weeks since moving to production. During this process:

* **200+** unique users downloaded the app.
* **170+** people registered.
* **80+** apps joined a Hive for testing.

I tried to ensure user participation by establishing a Reddit community. During this time, I tried to support dozens of users reaching out via email or directly on Reddit and put the ideas coming from them into practice.

I believe I found a real need and was able to provide a real solution.",Evening_Candy9567,1pafdmz,SideProject,30-11-2025,10:44:40,https://i.redd.it/0g35bqeaid4g1.png

This is how we find a 10K MRR SaaS idea,"For the past year, I kept launching ideas that went nowhere.  
Some got a few users but no revenue, others never even made it to launch.

This year, we finally developed a repeatable process that helped us land on the idea for our current project, [Leado](https://leado.co), an AI agent that monitors Reddit and alerts you when someone is literally asking for what you offer. A simple tool for founders and indie makers who want to catch real buying intent in real time.

Here is the process that finally worked for us.

# Step 1: Define your criteria

Before looking for ideas, we wrote down exactly what we wanted:

• Existing competitors: Proof that demand is real  
• Minimum 10K MRR potential: A market big enough that solving the problem is worth it  
• Quick MVP: Something we can build in about 2 weeks  
• Personal fit: A problem we actually care about solving  
• Predictable distribution: A channel where users are already active

This alone eliminated 90 percent of bad ideas.

# Step 2: Use these idea discovery strategies

# 1. Listen to what people are asking for

We searched for questions like:  
""What tools do you use for...?""  
""Is there software that does this?""  
""How do you solve...?""

Reddit is a goldmine for uncovering gaps in existing solutions.  
People openly complain, describe workarounds and ask for tools that do not exist yet.

This is actually where the idea for Leado came from.

# 2. Follow the money

We scanned Upwork and Fiverr to find problems people already pay to solve.  
Automation, research, lead hunting, workflow fixes, analytics and niche operational tasks show up again and again.

If someone is paying freelancers for it, there is often room for a SaaS.

# 3. Explore startup directories

YC, Techstars and other accelerator directories are underrated research tools.  
Scrolling through them helps spot underserved niches that are gaining momentum.

# 4. Cold outreach

We emailed a small group of people in industries we understood.  
We asked them what they currently struggle with most and what they spend time on that feels repetitive.  
We validated patterns by talking to more people in the same niche.

This identified problems far more clearly than brainstorming ever did.

# 5. Track what is gaining traction

We monitored Product Hunt, Indie Hackers and Trends VC.  
Comments like:  
""This is cool but I wish it also did XYZ""  
were often better idea generators than the products themselves.

# What I learned

The hardest part is not finding an idea.  
The hardest part is going deep enough on the problem and staying committed long enough to understand how painful it truly is.

Once we focused on simple criteria and real user frustrations, ideas became much easier to evaluate.

Why isn't there a javascript library to escape In-App Browsers? So I built one,"When you click a shared link on Instagram or any other messenger, it usually opens in an **in-app browser**.

Suddenly, your perfectly crafted website loads inside a stripped-down, crappy in-app browser. Login sessions don’t persist, PWA features break, and the UX just feels off.

I wanted a simple way, just a few lines of code to detect when a user is trapped and give them a clear escape hatch to their system browser.

I assumed a library for this already existed, so I went looking. But I couldn’t find one.

So I built **InAppBrowserEscaper**.



**What it does:**

\- **Detection**: Handles in-app browser detections by parsing user-agent, checking API supports for apps like Instagram, Facebook, Telegram, LINE, KakaoTalk, etc.

\- **Simple Escape**: With one line of code, you can let users escape.

\- **Zero Dependencies**: It’s tiny and won’t bloat your bundle.

\- **Framework-Agnostic**: Written in TypeScript, works with React, Angular, or vanilla JS.

Spent 3 months building a reading app - is it worth continuing?,"**What it is:** Readora - a web app where you can read stories chapter by chapter, similar to Wattpad but focused on experience.

**Link:** [theReadora.vercel.app](http://theReadora.vercel.app)

**Why I made it:**

I got tired of reading web novels on platforms cluttered with ads, annoying popups, and distracting interfaces, broken features and shit like UI and UX. I wanted something clean where I could just read without interruption and without broken features. So I built this.

**What it does:**

* Read stories chapter by chapter
* Bookmark where you left off
* Clean, distraction-free interface
* Works on phone and desktop
* No ads (for now, at least)
* Dashboard for authors
* Premium reads through coins and premium subscription

**Current stage:**

It's functional but bare bones. I have a few test stories up there to show how it works. The upload system exists but needs polish.

**What I need from you:**

1. **Does the reading experience feel good?** Is the text comfortable? Layout annoying?
2. **What's confusing or broken?** Don't hold back - I need to know what doesn't work.
3. **Would you actually use this?** If no, why not? What's missing?
4. **Compared to where you read now** (Wattpad, Royal Road, AO3, wherever) - what would make you switch?

**What I'm NOT asking:**

* Don't sugarcoat things to be nice
* Don't tell me it's ""great"" unless you mean it
* I'm not looking for compliments, I want real problems identified

Try it out, break it if you can, and tell me what sucks. That's the most helpful thing you can do. Should i continue building this or just stop it.

**Tech** stack: Built with Next.js, t3-stack, Prisma with Postgresql and Mongodb.

"Building a polaroid wall of your journey (posts, milestones, metrics...)","**The goal** is to both:

* show everyone your journey visually, your milestones, metrics, important/favourite posts, highlights...
* see your own progress + save any post you want easily, organised by category/product



**Why:** On X there's only one post directly visible at all times: your pinned post.

Everything else gets lost, no matter how important it was to you.

And if you post your metrics in daily updates or something, no one will ever check your previous posts or your highlights to ""understand"" your journey.

Even if they did, it's too messy, no one would scroll vertically on someone's profile.

Finally shipped a tools website with 135 free tools (no login / no paywalls) as my side project,"Hey Peeps!

This past month I’ve been obsessed with building something small but genuinely useful.

So I ended up making **Ocean of Tools** — a collection of 135+ free tools(more coming soon) for devs, designers, writers, students… basically anyone who needs quick utility stuff.

It has things like:

* JSON formatter
* Image converters
* Hash / UUID generators
* Text utilities
* Media tools
* Color tools
* Math + unit converters …and a bunch more.

**Everything works in the browser, no login, no paywall, no ads slapped on your face.**

I’ve created an Internet Archive browser for mobile devices using Flutter,"Hello! Hope this is okay to share here. For the last few months I have been working on a mobile browser for the Internet Archive. It is currently working on iOS and Android using Flutter. I thought I would share my progress as this project nears completion. 

I have made a YouTube short of it running on my iPhone, demonstrating some of its features which you can view here, https://youtube.com/shorts/Nt343h3u1xI?

Also here is another video of it running on a Samsung A9 tablet and demoing custom thumbnails, adding favourites and screen casting. Also my cat says hi! https://youtube.com/shorts/fm8heV6IzJA?

Features include:

•  Full-text search across the entire Archive.org catalog from the home screen, with quick-filter chips for Texts, Video, Audio, and Images.

•  Detailed collection browsing with selectable sort orders, grid or list display, title-only or metadata search scopes, infinite scroll, safe-for-work filtering, and custom thumbnail support.

•  Ability to pin frequently used collections to a dedicated collections screen for instant access; pinned items can be refreshed, opened directly, and unpinning is reversible via undo prompt.

•  Favourites system with user-created folders (plus an automatic “All” view) and a folder picker when saving items.

Dedicated media players:

•  Audio player supporting single tracks and queued playlists, displaying title and cover art, preserving playback position, and offering return-to-collection navigation.

•  Video player with playlist queuing, AirPlay, Chromecast, and DLNA casting, plus resume-from-last-position support.

•  Built-in PDF and document viewer that caches files locally, resumes at the last page, and allows per-file bookmarks.

•  Settings screen for selecting light/dark theme and accent color, toggling NSFW content and license-type filters, clearing cached files, viewing app version, donating to the Internet Archive, and submitting bug reports.

The app is designed to make browsing, saving, and playing Archive.org content fast and convenient on mobile devices.  All data is saved to temporary cache which is purged upon app closure.

The plan is to release this completely free, with no ads but with a link to donate if you enjoy the app.

"I built a Zero-Knowledge(no knowledge) Password Manager where you can share passwords via qr codes. (Runs on Cloudflare, still in beta)","Hi everyone,

I got tired of paying monthly subscriptions just to securely share a Netflix or banking password with my family, and I honestly lost trust in legacy managers after the LastPass architecture breaches.

So, I spent the last few weeks building **EazyPasswords** – a Zero-Knowledge password manager running entirely on the Edge (Cloudflare).

**The ""Cool"" Technical Part (The QR Dead Drop)**  
Sharing passwords securely is usually a pain. You typically need the recipient to already have an account with public keys set up. But what if you want to share something instantly with someone sitting next to you?

I built a **""Dead Drop""** system using QR codes:

1. **Client-Side:** The browser generates a random ephemeral AES key.
2. **Encryption:** The password is encrypted locally with that key.
3. **The Split:** The **Encrypted Blob** is sent to my server (Cloudflare D1). The **Decryption Key** is embedded into a **QR Code image**.
4. **Result:** My server holds the lock, but you hold the physical key. The server physically cannot read the data because the key was never sent over the network—it exists only in the QR image on your screen.

**The Stack (Fast & Cheap)**  
I wanted this to load instantly, so I avoided heavy frameworks.

* **Backend:** Cloudflare Workers (Hono framework) - Runs globally within milliseconds.
* **Database:** Cloudflare D1 (SQLite at the Edge).
* **Frontend:** Vanilla JS (No React bloat, just pure speed).
* **Crypto:** Web Crypto API (PBKDF2 -> AES-GCM -> RSA-OAEP).

**I need your help (Beta)**  
I am looking for people to break it, test the UI, or tell me why my CSS sucks.

If you sign up during this Beta phase, I’m giving everyone a **Free Lifetime Family Plan**(which allows up to 10 members) as a thank you for testing.

Remote yt-shorts scroller using brave global media controller,"So I'm trying to control YouTube Shorts using Brave's global media control popup — the note icon thing you click in the toolbar. The idea is simple: I want to stay on a different Brave tab and still press Next or Previous and have the Shorts tab scroll to the next or previous Short. I don't want to actually switch to the YouTube tab to swipe, that's the whole point — full remote scroll using Brave’s built-in media control.

The raw ways I'm attempting to solve it are basically browser trickery ideas. Things like forcing a fake media session so Brave believes there's a playlist(which now i've found that the short might be generated as we go?)  , registering next/previous action handlers through MediaSession API, simulating trusted clicks on Shorts navigation arrows, or even injecting a hidden dummy looping video to keep Brave from suspending the tab. I also tried updating metadata and re-binding handlers repeatedly because Shorts loads everything dynamically, so I figured keeping the media session alive might help Brave finally enable the buttons.

The issue is, nothing actually sticks. Brave keeps the Next and Previous controls grayed out in the popup, meaning it doesn’t register that those actions even exist for the Shorts tab. Even when I manage to inject clicks, Brave doesn't treat them as trusted or just doesn't fire them when the video tab is in the background. Play and pause works fine, but next and prev is completely dead. Feels like Brave is straight-up ignoring anything synthetic and unless YouTube itself registers a legit media session, Brave won’t listen.

"We’re 15 & 17 from India. Dad gave us 1,100 usd to build an AI social media manager. Launching today.","Hey r/SideProject ,

I’m Akshat (15) and my brother Arjun is (17).

A few months ago, our dad handed us his business Instagram and Facebook accounts and said, “Just handle it.” Before this, we were studying data science and trying to run a small SMMA, so we thought, “Easy.”

We were wrong. It turned into:

* Late nights stuck in Canva for every single post.
* Begging ChatGPT for captions that didn’t sound like a robot.
* Trying schedulers like Hootsuite/Buffer and realizing they don’t actually *create* anything—you still have to do all the hard work yourself.

It felt broken. We had data science skills, so why couldn’t we build a tool that intelligently does the creative work too?

**So we built Wyna.**

It’s an AI social media manager that creates and posts for you.

* Drop in a website URL once.
* Spend \~10 seconds a month telling Wyna to ""go.""
* It generates 30 days of custom posts & reels (copy, hashtags, visuals, timing).
* Auto-publishes everything to FB & IG.

**The big difference:** No templates. Wyna creates fully custom visuals for every brand, so a B2B SaaS doesn’t look like a local gym.

We built this from our bedroom in Gurugram over the last 4 months, bootstrapped with ₹94k (\~$1,100) from our dad, all while juggling school exams. Today we launched on Product Hunt, and we’re honestly terrified but excited.

**We’d love your brutal feedback:**

* Is this solving a real problem for you, or just scratching our own itch?
* What are we missing?
* Is the pricing/positioning clear?

Built a Mac app to post on social media without timeline distractions,"I kept getting distracted by timelines every time I tried to post something. Would open X to share something, 20 minutes later I'm still scrolling.

Built a menu bar app that removes the timeline entirely:

* Option+X → X compose window (Spotlight-style)
* Option+L → LinkedIn compose
* Cmd+Enter to post, auto-closes after
* 100% keyboard-driven, no mouse needed

No feed, no distractions. Just the compose box.

Built with Electron, uses webviews for native compose UI (no API needed, credentials stay sandboxed). Code signed + notarized.

It turned into something larger.

It’s an AI agent that crawls your app, figures out how it works, creates tests on its own, and keeps them updated as the product changes. You set it up and it runs quietly in the background.

We’re doing a free beta and would love feedback from other builders working on side projects, SaaS tools, and anything UI heavy.

Runway Gen-4.5: How It Helps Founders and Marketers Create Better Ads?,"Runway Gen-4.5 is a major breakthrough for marketers and founders, delivering state-of-the-art video quality that finally brings AI production into true studio territory. Beyond sharper visuals, the model follows prompts with far greater accuracy, allowing teams to produce exactly the scenes, movements, and product shots they imagined—without dozens of retakes or technical hacks. Its realistic physics, lighting behavior, and frame-to-frame consistency make it ideal for polished product demos, cinematic ads, and launch teasers that previously required full crews, sets, and expensive post-production. 

For early-stage founders operating under tight budgets, this means turning creative ideas into fully finished ads in hours instead of weeks. The ability to rapidly iterate on multiple ad angles, concepts, and visual identities gives smaller teams a genuine competitive advantage, letting them test, refine, and outperform much larger brands that still rely on traditional workflows. Gen-4.5 doesn’t just speed up content creation—it completely reshapes how fast a startup can enter the market with high-quality advertising.

**Bonus Tools for Execution:**  
  
**Campaign Inspiration:** To maximize the model's potential, you can leverage campaign ideas and strategic guidance from resources like [Unik Ads](http://unikads.beehiiv.com) where you can find unique and fresh ad ideas weekly.

  
**Ad Generation & Testing:** Furthermore, integrating Gen-4.5's high-quality output with other AI tools like [Pencil](http://trypencil.com) for ad generation and testing creates a powerful, end-to-end creative workflow.

"I got 20 users using this simple Reddit method, here’s how","Reddit is the best marketing channel you can use.. if you use it well.

But it’s hard, because you need to find the right conversations without looking spammy.



Still, I once brought **10k+ visitors** to a project just through Reddit.  
And with my latest project, I got **20 users in a couple of days** using the exact same method.



Here it is:



**1. Comment early**

This is where most results come from.  
Find new threads in your niche and add a genuinely helpful comment.  
People click your profile → discover your project naturally.



**2. Post only when it’s useful**

When you post, talk about the *problem*, not your product.  
Useful insights get attention. 



**3. Track your niche**

Every topic has specific subreddits and recurring keywords.  
If you catch those conversations early, you win.  
If you miss them, the opportunity is gone.

\_



That’s why I eventually built [RedShip](https://redship.io)**,** to stop missing those threads.

I used it myself and that’s how I found the conversation that brought my first users!",Leading-Visual-4939,1pd0knk,SideProject,03-12-2025,10:20:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pd0knk/i_got_20_users_using_this_simple_reddit_method/
I made Elliot a AI terminal emulator,"Hi everyone,  
I’ve been developing a project called [Elliot](https://github.com/rylena/Elliot), a natural-language interface for the Linux terminal, and I’d appreciate any feedback from the community.

you guys can test it out here [https://github.com/rylena/Elliot](https://github.com/rylena/Elliot)

# What Elliot does

Elliot takes plain-English instructions and converts them into **precise, safe Linux commands**. The goal is to reduce the friction of remembering flags, syntax, and command structures while still keeping the user fully in control.

# Why I built it

I created Elliot because:

* i dont like remembering linux commands
* documentation is inconsistent across tools
* beginners get stuck on small details instead of learning concepts
* even advanced users sometimes want a quicker way to express intent

# Key features

* Natural language → validated shell commands
* Streamlines repetitive or complex tasks
* Uses the Gemini API cus its free

# What I’m looking for

Feedback on:

* workflow and usability
* prompt safety and edge cases
* technical improvements
* missing features or rough spots

Made 5 sales worth 10💵 on my platform and I’m happy about it,"I’m still in the very early days of building my platform, and one thing I’ve already learned is that marketing comes first.

So I put together this [MVP](https://splitsplash.vercel.app) super simple, not polished at all and somehow I’ve already made my first dollars from it, even with a few complaints along the way.

The platform is basically for **tracking shared expenses** and helping people **save money** while doing it. I reached out to people individually (Facebook, Reddit, etc.). I set a limit on group members unless they paid $2 and 5 people paid.

I was honestly surprised because I hadn’t built any feature that I thought someone would pay for. But those who paid told me that once they added the $2 fee as part of the group expenses, they barely felt it.

That experience alone made this totally worth it. Users pointed out flaws, told me what caught their interest, and now I actually know where to find people who are willing to pay.

“**A terrible product can sell with good marketing**” I agree.  
But now it’s time to **improve the product**, because I don’t just want one-off purchases. I want people to *want* to keep paying. So yes, distribution is important, but so is building something that people like using.",YogurtclosetFit1947,1pd0equ,SideProject,03-12-2025,10:09:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pd0equ/made_5_sales_worth_10_on_my_platform_and_im_happy/
Developing was fun and easy. Selling is hard.,"So recently I have posted and talked about my two Chrome extensions that I published.

One was an extension made to resize your window so that you could test the responsiveness of your web page.

The second extension was a notes manager. A place where you save those cool AI prompts or random information you will never need anyways.

Now my window resizer is doing okay with about 10 active users. But my Notes extension has completely failed.

What have I learned from it?

People need a simple solution to their problems because let's be honest, how many people do even know that Chrome extensions exist? S

Building a small project to help low income people build wealth in London.,"I’ve been building a small newsletter after long retail shifts, and honestly it has become the thing that keeps me going.

"Ok I think we have all had it with this sub not being moderated, so here is the plan and it needs a lot of you to help","I like this sub, I do. It is interesting and I like seeing people make stuff. What I don't like is the amount of spam, people trying to sell services to people in the sub, the occasional borderline scam.

It would not be hard to update this sub, the absolute base level would be ensuring a minimum level of karma before being able to post here would clear a lot of the spam or even mandatory tags. But we have a problem.

Our mods are asleep. I have sent them mod mail as a lot of others with no response. The official path says to raise a post in the mod request subreddit but doing gets the request closed automatically because our 'mods are active'. I am not the only one who has tried, I also tried some of the escalation paths for that path and those also get closed with the same reason.

There is one more place we can get help. I have tried before and I am fairly certain it was just closed because it was one person asking and it didn't get proper attention. So... what we need to do is as many people in this sub as possible to raise it at once.

\---

What to do:

Within the requirements for being a mod there is a code of conduct. While most of requires a mod to be active to cite 'Rule 4: Be Active and Engaged' is what we want. It requires mods to be active, that there be enough mods to ensure a healthy community and most importantly 'Camping or sitting on a community is discouraged.' [https://redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct](https://redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct)

So what do you need to do? Go to the Reddit Support @ the following which is the option for 'Moderator Code of Conduct Report' -  
[https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket\_form\_id=19300233728916](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=19300233728916) (I'm showing the link so you know Im not doing a phishing thing).

Fill in the form with the details of the community and the names of the existing moderators [https://www.reddit.com/mod/SideProject/moderators/](https://www.reddit.com/mod/SideProject/moderators/)

You want to cite the community being unmoderated and the mods not responding to messages. You can try to message them if you like but if you have tried before then you have tried.

The goal here is to have the moderators removed so we can then make a mod request without it being automatically closed because we have 'active mods' which we clearly do not.

Ok that is it. My thought is that if there is a few dozen of the same request going through to report they will be harder to ignore and from what I can tell they do not get automatically closed like the other channels do (but it also does not guarantee a response).

Ok that's it. That's my plan and the best I got. So, if a lot of you could chip in (reporting the mods doesn't mean you have to be or want to be a mod) I hope we will be noisy enough to not ignore.

\---

One special note for the existing Moderators if you are reading this. Just add more moderators. We don't care who we just want some that will respond and setup some basic rules. We aren't expecting 24/7 support and responses but we would love the bare minimum of rules to help reduce the amount of spam that really does hurt this subreddit.",evilspyboy,1pd20it,SideProject,03-12-2025,12:44:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pd20it/ok_i_think_we_have_all_had_it_with_this_sub_not/

• Mentoring on SAP and enterprise SaaS solution design  
• Strong reference and recommendation  
• Priority for future paid work if the project raises money or starts generating revenue

What this is not  
• Not a salaried job at this stage  
• Not a ten hours per day grind

Time commitment  
• Around five to eight hours per week  
• Fully remote  
• Flexible around studies or work

I built MyCMO because 73% of founders say marketing slows them down the most,"I built something I wish I had years ago, and today finally I have launch it publicly.

A few months back, I came across a report that said **73% of early-stage founders list marketing as their biggest bottleneck**, even more than funding or product issues. Another stat: **68% struggle with “not knowing what to post consistently.”**

Those numbers felt uncomfortably familiar.

For the longest time, my cycle looked like this:  
**Build → Launch → Try to market → Burn out → Growth stalls.**  
I’d get excited during launch week, post for a few days, then run out of ideas, energy, and clarity. Meanwhile, other founders with average products but better consistency kept growing.

One night, after staring at a blank content doc for over an hour, I thought

“There needs to be a way to market without spending all day writing and guessing.”

That frustration became the first version of MyCMO

Today, it’s a full marketing engine, built specifically for founders who are doing everything themselves.

Here’s what it does:

* **No content ideas?** → X, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Studios generate scripts, threads, posts.
* **Copy feels robotic?** → Copy Refiner + Smart Reply make it sound human.
* **No time for blogs or emails?** → Blog Writer + Email Campaign handle long-form.
* **Not sure where your audience hangs out?** → Find Audience.
* **GTM unclear?** → A 10-module Growth Engine.
* **SEO confusing?** → SEO Optimiser + pSEO + Competitor Analyzer.
* **Need quick direction?** → Growth Card.

A lot of people are struggling to find ideas or end up building another GPT wrapper that nobody uses. But that’s not the point. Just start building something. Once you begin, you’ll face real problems, and those problems can turn into actual product ideas.

Today I’m launching my second SaaS ([shipsafer.app](https://shipsafer.app)). I’m trying to iterate in a smarter way. I made a boilerplate from my first app and it speeds up everything. Setting up Stripe took about two minutes, connecting my database took around thirty seconds. That means now I can focus on the real features and the UI instead of repeating the same setup work.

I feel motivated. Next year will be even better. I want to ship more SaaS products and keep improving the ones I already have.

Global Visa Ally,"​I wanted to share a tool I built called Global Visa Ally. (Apologies to the mod but I couldn't find the Show Off Flair)

​The problem:
Moving abroad is expensive. Immigration lawyers and agencies typically charge £2,000 to £5,000 just to file paperwork that you could technically do yourself if you had the right guidance. The forms are intentionally confusing, and a single mistake can lead to a rejection.

​The solution:
I built an AI-powered platform that acts as a digital immigration assistant. It guides users through the entire lifecycle of a visa application for a one-time fee of £99.99 (Lifetime Access), with unlimited applications for every user. 

​Here is what the platform actually does:
​Visa Job Search Engine: It aggregates verified sponsorship jobs from official government portals so users can find employers who are actually licensed to hire expats.
​AI Document Writer: Instead of writing statements of purpose or cover letters from scratch, the AI generates them based on the user's profile to match specific visa criteria.
​Compliance Scanning: We use computer vision to scan passport photos and documents to ensure they meet strict government formatting rules (one of the most common reasons for rejection).
​Mock Interview Simulator: Users can practice for their consular interview with an AI agent that asks questions specific to their destination country.

​Global Database: We support requirements for over 150 countries.

​My goal was to use AI to democratize access to global mobility, making it affordable for students and nomads who cannot afford high-end legal firms.

​I would love to get your feedback on the landing page or the tool itself.

"After 21 years of shift work, I built my first app at 45 to solve the mess families deal with when someone dies","Hey everyone,

I spent 21 years doing shift work. Earlier this year I decided to change careers and enrolled in a data analytics bootcamp. But on the side, I couldn't stop thinking about a problem I'd seen up close: what happens to families when someone dies and nobody knows where anything is.

Bank accounts. Passwords. Insurance policies. Property documents. 

The login to that one crypto exchange. It's chaos, and it happens to almost every family.

So I taught myself to code and built **3terna** \- a simple way to organize everything your family would need, and deliver it to them automatically when the time comes.

**What it does:**

* Store documents, passwords, financial info, messages - whatever matters
* Assign specific items to specific people
* Automatic check-in system - if you stop responding, your trusted contacts get access
* Video/audio messages for the people you love
* No lawyers, no complexity, works on any device

**What I learned building this:**

1. Security is 10x harder than features. I spent weeks on encryption and access controls.
2. The hardest part isn't code - it's getting people to think about death. Nobody wants to, but everyone should.
3. AI tools accelerated my learning massively, but you still need to understand what you're building.
4. Shipping beats perfecting. I could tweak forever, but real feedback only comes from real users.

I'm not a developer by trade - just a guy who saw a problem and wouldn't let it go.

If you've dealt with estate chaos in your own family, or if you have feedback on the idea, I'd genuinely love to hear it.

🚀 Why PIYE Exists (and Why It’s NOT “Just Another ChatGPT”),"Over the past weeks, I’ve received different kinds of feedback:

❓ “Why use PIYE instead of ChatGPT?”
❓ “Explaining code is not explaining enough.”
❓ “Isn’t this the same as any AI tool?”

These are valid questions, and I want to answer them clearly.

Because PIYE is not trying to replace AI tools.
PIYE exists to fill the biggest gap AI leaves behind.

****

1. Tools like ChatGPT give you answers.

PIYE gives you direction.

Modern AI is amazing at:
✔ generating code
✔ solving problems fast
✔ giving instant output

But it struggles with:
❌ long-term project context
❌ structured learning
❌ tracking your progress
❌ remembering your entire codebase
❌ teaching developers how to think
❌ explaining engineering reasoning

This is the reason why many junior devs feel stuck using AI:

“I got the code, but I still don’t understand anything.”

PIYE solves exactly that.

****

2. PIYE Mentor goes beyond “answering”

It acts more like a patient senior engineer who:

✨ breaks features down
✨ explains code in human language
✨ guides decisions
✨ helps you understand why, not just what
✨ remembers your project and progress
✨ gives learning structure

This is mentorship, not output.

****

3. PIYE Studio teaches what everyone needs today:

How to think with AI.

Because AI skills are not about prompts.
They are about engineering thinking:

• breaking a project into steps
• designing features
• asking better questions
• understanding architecture
• learning coding patterns

PIYE Studio trains that, something no generic AI tool does.

****

4. PIYE gives you a journey, not a chat window

Instead of random answers, you get:

✔ Roadmaps
✔ Micro tasks
✔ Sessions saved
✔ Follow-ups
✔ Decisions
✔ Project memory
✔ Progress tracking

No “lost in the chat history” anymore.

****

5. PIYE is early and improving fast in terms of; 

• explanations
• project guidance
• mentor intelligence
• studio lessons
• UX and flow

Early feedback isn’t something negative, it’s fuel to build something truly helpful for developers.

And I’m grateful to everyone who tested PIYE so far.

****

❤️ FINAL NOTE

PIYE is not trying to replace AI tools like ChatGPT.

It’s trying to make developers better, more structured, confident, and capable.

If you’ve ever felt lost while building with AI…
If you want guidance, not just answers…
If you want to understand your code, not just copy it…

Then PIYE is built for you.

How do you usually get feedback on your projects?,"A few months ago, I finished a small project: a website that generates transcriptions and summaries from videos, audio files, or pretty much anything you give it as input.

This project was more a way for me to learn than a real business ambition. Once it was built, I obviously tested it a lot myself, but I was not confident. I needed outside opinions. And that’s where things started to get complicated.

I first showed the site to my close circle (friends and family). Most of them told me it looked great, but didn’t even go as far as creating an account. Only two of them gave me real, useful feedback.

So I tried to get feedback from strangers on the internet. And I quickly discovered that on many platforms like Reddit, Facebook, and others, asking for feedback while sharing your link is considered promotion and often gets removed.

And in the places that are actually made for creators to share their projects and ask for feedback, I noticed something else: they are full of creators waiting for feedback… but very few people actually there to give feedback.

That’s when an idea came to me: all these app creators waiting next to each other for feedback, they would probably be willing to test each other’s products if it allowed them to get feedback in return.

From there, I pushed the idea a bit further: what if there was a platform with an exchange currency, let’s call it “credits” (what an imagination). You post your project, you test other people’s apps to “farm” credits, and you use those credits to pay for feedback on your own product.

The idea was simple, but it felt really good to me. I honestly thought something like this already existed. To my surprise, I couldn’t find anything even close to that.

So I decided to build the product I wished I had at that time. After several months of work, the site is now at MVP stage.

I’m currently looking for the very first users to help shape the platform. If you’re interested in posting your project to get feedback, or if you just want to take a look, feel free to DM me.

See you around!

I built a Chrome extension that extracts any website's design system so you can recreate it,"I build websites for clients and myself. The conversation usually goes like this:


""I want it to look like [some website]""


Then I spend 30 minutes inspecting elements, copying hex codes, eyeballing spacing, trying to figure out their hover animations... only to end up with something that looks ""off"".


So I built DesignMirror - a Chrome extension that analyzes any page and extracts the complete design DNA:

  • Color palette (primary, secondary, accent, neutrals)

  • Typography (fonts, scale ratios, hierarchy)

  • Spacing system (base unit, scale)

  • Shadows, border radius, gradients

  • Animations, transitions, timing functions

I built a decentralized gaming platform with different on-chain games (Next.js + Solidity),"I wanted to share a side project I've been working on called [CFT.live](https://www.cft.live).

It's a decentralized application (dApp) deployed on Arbitrum One that offers a few different ways for users to compete against each other using smart contracts. The goal was to build a platform where all game logic, funds, and outcomes are handled entirely on-chain for transparency.

**The Games**  
Currently, the platform features three distinct game modes:

1. **Prediction Market**
   * **How it works:** Users can create or join betting rounds on the price movement of assets (like ETH or BTC). You bet on whether the price will be UP or DOWN by a specific time.
   * **The Tech:** It uses **Pyth Network** oracles to fetch real-time price feeds directly to the smart contract. The starting price is locked when the round goes live, and the final price determines the winner who takes the pot.
2. **Hash Roulette**
   * **How it works:** A high-stakes, turn-based elimination game. Players join a table and take turns ""pulling the trigger"" by picking a number and placing a bet. If your number matches the random outcome, you are eliminated. The last player standing wins the entire pot.
   * **The Tech:** To ensure fairness, this uses **Chainlink VRF** (Verifiable Random Function) to generate provably random outcomes on-chain that cannot be manipulated.
3. **Lotto Pool**
   * **How it works:** A simple, continuous lottery system. Users buy tickets for the current open draw. Once the draw is closed, a random ticket is selected as the winner, who claims all funds collected from ticket sales. A new draw starts automatically immediately after. Anyone can close the draw at any given time.

**Technical Stack**

* **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router) & Tailwind CSS.
* **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (Hardhat for development).
* **Infrastructure:** The Graph (for indexing blockchain data), Cloudflare Pages (hosting).
* **Integrations:** Pyth Network (Price Feeds), Chainlink (VRF).

**Why I built it**  
I wanted to experiment with different types of web3 interactions, from real-time data dependencies in the Prediction Market to the turn-based state management required for the Roulette. It’s been a great way to learn about the challenges of synchronization between a frontend and an immutable blockchain backend.

"I built a tool (another one!) for testing your vibe coded web apps for leaks and exposed Supabase DBs, and other keys","Hi {vibe} coders! I recently created a Google Chrome extension to help me spot exposed keys and Supabase instances, I would love to have your feedback on this. Anyone want to try it?

It also detects API key leaks from other >10 services as well. But, the main focus is around securing our Supabase projects, and spotting missing RLS configs

I got tired of going through the networks or sources tabs in the Dev Tools, so I made this to automate the whole process.

During the past 2 weeks, I've been working in the sharing and Cloud platform, because I received a lot of initial feedback from the first users that a way of quickly sharing the findings was missing. Now I can get a sharing link and send it to the developer in seconds, so they can fix the issues.

I've been using this for personal projects, but also to alert other people about their vulnerable apps.

Again, any feedback is more than welcome, and I know inside Supabase platform is more than enough tools and warnings about how to properly config your project, but most of the users having these sort of security vulns are using third party dev apps like Lovable, Bolt, etc, and they hardly visit the Supabase dashboard.

Built a tiny contract making tool!,"TL:DR - Super useful, inexpensive contract maker.

Been messing around with an idea the last week or two…

I kept getting annoyed at how long it takes to deal with contracts as a freelancer. Templates are boring, legal platforms feel overkill, and most tools want you on a monthly subscription before you can even download anything.

So I built a tiny, super simple contract generator.

You type in:

\- Your name

\- Client name

\- What you’re doing

\- Start/end dates

\- Fee + payment terms

\- Jurisdiction

And it spits out a clean, properly formatted service agreement ready for e-signing, plus a nice PDF version.

Takes about 60 seconds start to finish.

My whole goal was:

Fast, no signup, no subscriptions. Just generate, download, done.

I priced it CHEAP because I didn’t want to make it free (value perception dies instantly), and I didn’t want it to become another bloated SaaS with a paywall. Just a tiny tool that does one job really well.

If anyone wants to take a look and tell me if anything feels confusing / rough / missing, I’d massively appreciate it:

As an artist, I’ve done commission work for people who never actually paid me. It’s frustrating to put hours into something and then have no compensation. I wanted to create a simple solution to this problem, so I built a platform where:

* Artists can upload commission work.
* The client only sees a watermarked version until the work is paid for.
* Once the payment goes through, the final unwatermarked artwork is revealed.

It’s pretty simple, but it solves a real pain point I experienced personally. My goal was to make it easy for artists to protect their work while still accepting commissions online.

I’d love feedback from anyone who’s done freelance or commission work, and I’m also curious if other artists think something like this would actually help them.",Alert-Ad-5918,1pd3r2p,SideProject,03-12-2025,14:11:22,https://i.redd.it/5ojrvqkwmz4g1.png
Do I really need to go through a huge OAuth verification process to create a simple gmail assistant app?,"I wanted to build a little email assistant for myself that responds to certain emails using all my previous related emails and a bunch of other context pulled from Gemini's new file search tool. I got the whole system working for myself and it was great. But then a few of my friends wanted to try it out so I thought it would be a good idea to make it public with a BYOK or optional payment setup. That way people can use it for free if they're willing to spend 2 minutes to get a gemini api token. And plus I don't have to pay for everyone's AI usage. Only problem is, this app uses sensitive scopes like ""https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.compose"", which require a large review process in order to go public. My question is: has anyone gone through this OAuth review process before? How long does it take, and is it even worth it?   
  
My other option is to just make it a Gmail Add-on, where you have to open the email you want to respond to and manually click generate. This doesn't use any sensitive scopes, and so the verification process should be much easier.

TLDR: How long and annoying is the OAuth verification process (with sensitive scopes)? And is it worth tackling for a little side project?",F1RCE,1pd3mem,SideProject,03-12-2025,14:05:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pd3mem/do_i_really_need_to_go_through_a_huge_oauth/
Building a chat-based admin panel that replaces traditional click UIs - early demo,"Hey everyone!

I'm working on Voks - an agentic AI admin panel where you manage everything through chat instead of clicking through menus and forms.

\- ""Update order #1234 status to shipped""

\- ""Show revenue from last month""

I have a social media. How do I get the first 1000 users??,"Hey everyone, so I’m getting ready to launch my first app ever. The idea is simple: a social media where business isn’t boring, and where posts actually lead to real opportunities instead of just likes.

Imagine a place where you can share an idea  even a crazy one and instead of it dying in your notes app, you can actually find people who want to build it with you. Whether it’s a startup, a side project, a physical business, whatever… you can post it, share updates, look for teammates/ co founders/ investors, and connect with people who can help you create it, grow or scale. From ALL AROUND THE WORLD. It feels a bit like TikTok but for people who want to create things instead of just watch them.

Content it serves multiple purpose: from enterteinment, to utility and learning, inspiration or just doom scrolling like on tiktok or Instagram. But useful.

The hard part is the beginning: if there aren’t enough projects, new users won’t have anything to explore. And if people don’t join, there won’t be projects. It’s that classic loop every new platform goes through.

So the question is easy:

How to bring inside the first 1000 users???",Embarrassed_Pack6391,1pd3job,SideProject,03-12-2025,14:02:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pd3job/i_have_a_social_media_how_do_i_get_the_first_1000/
Rebuilt my side project after v1 flopped. Finally shipping v2.,"Two months ago I launched [Ralix ](https://www.ralix.ai)— a tool that monitors Reddit to find leads for your product.

Got signups, got feedback, and the feedback wasn't great. Leads weren't matching what people actually wanted. Some felt random. I took it down and went back to rebuild.

The new version uses AI to understand intent, not just match keywords. It scores every lead and only surfaces ones that actually look like someone wanting a solution. It also targets subreddits specific to your product instead of monitoring everything.

You've probably seen a bunch of Reddit lead gen tools lately. Most of them give you unlimited leads per day which sounds great until you realize most of it is noise. I capped Ralix at 30-50 per day on purpose. Quality over quantity.

Finally shipping v2 today. It's not perfect but I was stuck in ""just one more fix"" mode for too long.",No-Common1466,1pd3jbr,SideProject,03-12-2025,14:01:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pd3jbr/rebuilt_my_side_project_after_v1_flopped_finally/
Hume Health 20% Off Discount Code,"I’ve been using the Hume Health Body Pod for a while and it’s been a mixed experience. On the positive side, it gives you way more data than a normal scale — body fat, muscle mass, water levels, visceral fat, metabolic rate, all of it. When it works, the trend tracking is actually useful. Seeing changes over weeks instead of obsessing over a single weigh-in helps make sense of training and diet, especially if you're lifting and bodyweight alone doesn’t tell the full story.

The downside is consistency. The readings can jump around if you weigh in at different times or if your hydration is off, and sometimes the app connection is flaky. I’ve also seen a lot of people complain about customer support being slow or unhelpful, which tracks with some of the hiccups I’ve had getting the device synced. It’s not something I’d treat as medically accurate — it’s more of a directional tool than a precise measurement device.

Overall, Hume Health is good if you want more data than a basic scale and you’re fine with treating the numbers as trends instead of absolutes. If you’re expecting perfectly accurate body fat readings or flawless app syncing, you’ll probably be disappointed. But if you’re already tracking workouts and want extra metrics to compare week to week, it’s solid enough to keep using.",Real_Boysenberry_149,1pd3fm3,SideProject,03-12-2025,13:57:25,https://www.humehealth.com/ANDREW37432
[Discussion] I rebuilt an entire Flutter app codebase in 17 days using Codex AI to fix 0% test coverage. What was the hardest part of your AI refactor?,"Hello r/SideProject  community!

I am a solo developer working on a mood tracker app called MoodTrend. My previous app was stuck with an old codebase and 0% test coverage, making improvements almost impossible.

So, I decided to use Codex AI to refactor the entire app in 17 days, aiming to implement clean architecture and increase test coverage to 67%.

**The biggest surprise?**

I spent over 100 hours monitoring and correcting the AI-generated code. Human oversight was the most time-consuming, frustrating part of the entire process.

**So, I have a question for the community:**

For those who have used AI for large-scale refactoring or rebuilding, **what parts could AI not solve, and required the most time, effort, or frustration? How did you handle it?** I want to know if my experience is unique!

My side project turned 1 month old today and it’s already made 4.7k in revenue. I think this might prove there is a strong market for RAG chatbots!,"My side project, ChatRAG, just turned one month old today and it has already made 4.7k in revenue. I honestly didn’t expect this kind of validation so quickly, but it’s starting to feel like there is a real and growing demand for RAG chatbots.   
  
I built ChatRAG to help developers and indie makers ship AI products faster, and seeing people actually use it and pay for it has been surreal. Still a long road ahead, but this first month has given me a huge boost of energy to keep improving it.

Plufl Bed 20% Off Discount Code,"I’ve had the Plufl for a bit now and it’s basically a giant dog bed for humans — in the best way. The comfort level is the main selling point. The foam base is thick enough to actually support you, and the bolstered edges make it easy to tuck in and relax. It’s great for reading, watching TV, or just zoning out on the floor without feeling like you’re on the floor. The cover is soft, removable, and washes well, which matters because this thing gets used constantly.  
  
The biggest downside is the size. It takes up a lot of space, and if you don’t have a roomy living area it can feel intrusive. It’s also not cheap, and while the build quality is solid, you’re definitely paying for the novelty factor. This isn’t a replacement for a real mattress — it’s more of a lounge setup that you drag out when you want something cozy. Portability is decent but not amazing; it’s bulky even when folded.  
  
Overall, the Plufl is worth it if you like the idea of a dedicated chill spot that’s way more comfortable than a beanbag or floor pillow. It’s niche, but it nails what it’s designed for. If you have the space and you’re someone who spends a lot of downtime lounging, it’s one of the better comfort splurges I’ve tried.

Tipsy Elves 20% Off Discount Code,"Tipsy Elves nails what it aims for — fun, loud, party-ready apparel for holidays, vacations, or just goofy nights out. I’ve worn their stuff a few times (sweaters and a Hawaiian shirt), and people notice. The designs are bold and often ridiculous in a good way — exactly what you want if you’re going for “I’m here to have fun” rather than “I’m blending in.” The clothes feel comfy, casual, and good enough quality for occasional wear. For example, their tropical button-up — I wore it to a summer get-together, and it was lightweight and breezy as advertised.  
  
On the flip side: this isn’t “investment-quality” clothing. If you treat it like everyday wear, seams and fabric start showing wear sooner than a high-end brand. Some pieces are essentially novelty — great for a party or a holiday but not something you’d reach for week-in, week-out. Also, because of the style, you’ll look outlandish — which is the point, but not for everyone.  
  
Bottom line: Tipsy Elves is perfect for its niche — holiday parties, vacations, vacations-turned-party-vacations, or just nights when you want max fun. If you want wardrobe staples, skip it. But if you want “bold, silly, fun and get-noticed” — it’s a solid choice.

"""Drop your product link, let's support each other!"" - Can't hear it anymore! I've built a platform that ACTUALLY does what these posts promise.","The problem is simple: So many people are building and shipping (which is great) but of course everyone wants to get some feedback and maybe even more important some first users. Commenting under such posts often doesn't get you any of that. That's why I've built a platform where you can upload your app (simple link is enough) and other people will use it and give you feedback in exchange for credits that they can then use to get their own apps tested (more on how it works later). The platform has almost **600 users** and **366 tests** were already done so the idea is more then validated and the system works.

Here is how it works:

* You can **earn credits** by testing indie apps (fun + you help other makers)
* You can **use credits to get your own app tested by real people**
* No fake accounts -> all testers are **real users**
* Test more apps -> earn more credits -> your app will rank higher -> you get more visibility and more testers/users

"In a world where every AI product fights for your attention, I built something that does the opposite.",">

I’m actually not a Mac developer. By day, I’m an AI Infrastructure engineer working on Cloud Native tech and GPU Virtualization. I spend my time optimizing clusters, not building UIs.

But I’ve always been obsessed with productivity tools. Like many of you, I often feel overwhelmed by apps that demand too much attention, complex project hierarchies, guilt-inducing heatmaps, and endless gamification.

I just wanted a place to type ""One Thing"", focus on it, and then get out.

Inspired by Sindre Sorhus’s [One Thing](https://sindresorhus.com/one-thing), I wanted to build my own version with specific ""rituals"" and a satisfying completion flow.

Here’s the plot twist: I had zero experience with Swift or SwiftUI.

But we live in an amazing time. I decided to see if I could build a native macOS app entirely through dialogue with LLMs. It turns out, I could.

Every feature iteration, and even **the interactive Web OS demo site (**[**https://os.nimbus-nimo.com**](https://os.nimbus-nimo.com)**)** I built to showcase it, was completed while staying focused using the app itself. That confetti burst at the end? It’s a small dopamine hit, but it genuinely keeps me going.

ZenDoOne is:

* Minimal: Less noise, more focus. Input -> Focus -> Done.
* [Open Source](https://github.com/Nimbus318/ZenDoOne) & Offline: 100% transparent, zero data collection.
* Free: Because focus shouldn't be paywalled.

I hope this little tool helps you find your flow as much as it helped me build itself.

I built an AR app that lets you hide digital surprises in real-world locations. It's live on the App Store.,"Hey everyone,

I've been working on this idea for a while and finally shipped it. It's called **Urbaneggz**.

The concept: creators hide digital ""eggs"" at real-world locations – could be a song, a poem, a coupon, a message, whatever. Collectors use their phone to hunt for them. You don't know what's inside until you find it.

Think geocaching meets AR meets surprise content.

There's a web side for creators to place eggs, and an iOS app for collectors to find them.

**Here's a 1-minute video showing how it works:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNYDOlVLBz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNYDOlVLBz8)

**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/urbaneggz/id6751428721](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/urbaneggz/id6751428721)

**Website (for creators):** [https://urbaneggz.com/](https://urbaneggz.com/)

It's fully live now. I built everything myself but honestly have no idea how to grow it – that's not my skillset. Would love any feedback on the concept, the video, or advice on getting first users.

Thanks for checking it out.

I made a simple iOS app to help clean up your contacts — would love your feedback!,"Hey everyone 👋

I just released a small utility app to solve a problem I’ve had for years: an overloaded, messy contact list full of people who Im not really talk much, but still dont wanna remove it. I wanted a way to ""hide"" contacts from list quick and easy. But cant found any existing solution. Every suggestion tell create the new contact list and move contact to new list, but hell I have hundreds of contacts need to move and it so annoying. So I built ContactArchive, a lightweight tool that helps clean and contacts quickly and still show me who is called after archived.

App Store link: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/contactarchive/id6751402962](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/contactarchive/id6751402962) (works on iOS 17.6+)

Features  
\* Archive contacts you don’t need right now  
\* See Caller ID even for archived contacts (so you still know who’s calling!)  
\* See recent deleted contacts, so you can restore if you changed your mind (within a day)  
\* Restore to phone contacts anytime

Everything is stay on your phone, but I will add able to backup to iCloud and restore in next versions.

The feature See Caller ID for archived contacts only available for pro version at 1.99$, which I believe is deadly cheap, but I also reduced the price to just 0.99$ for a until 07/12/2025.

I built this for myself originally, but it turned out surprisingly useful, so I polished it into a real app. I’d really appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or bug reports from everyone.

If anyone here tries it out, thank you! I’m happy to answer questions or improve it based on your ideas. 🙏

I built an AI Workspace with built-in browser. Launching in Alpha,"I built this AI-first browser rethinking how AI and browsing should work together. Would love your honest feedback, bug reports, and feature requests.

**What's different?** Every AI browser lately (Atlas, Dia, Comet) just sticking a chat sidebar to your tabs and is calling it a day! That's not rethinking how we work or browse—that's duct tape.

**Slate is an AI workspace where browsing happens naturally within your research flow.** Start every session by chatting with AI, then seamlessly browse sources without switching apps. It's the inverse of traditional browsers: AI first, web second.

**How it works:**

1. Ask AI about ""best road running shoes for men""
2. AI searches and synthesizes results with the best recommendation
3. Open all recommendations in the tabs \*within the same session\*
4. Continue asking follow-ups with full context
5. Create New session for some other research with it’s own set of tabs! Avoid browsing clutter and take your research to the next level!

Chat, browse, research—all in one place.

**Callouts**

**⚡ Actually Fast**

* Built on Safari's WebKit engine—not another Chromium wrapper. Native macOS UI means everything is snappy and responsive.

**🔒 Privacy-First**

* We don't track your conversations, chat history. Ever. All history stays locally.
* Built-in ad blocking + tracking protection (based on UBlock Origin)

**🧠 Smart Session Management**

* **Auto-archives sessions** daily so your sidebar stays clean
* Pin important sessions to keep them
* Group browsing by topic/project automatically

We're a small team based in SV rethinking how AI and browsing should work together. Would love your honest feedback, bug reports, and feature requests.

Voice Agents Were Easy. Email Broke My Brain.,"I’ve been building AI voice agents that can make calls, book appointments, and answer customer questions. All good… until a client asked, “Can it also reply to our support emails?”

I thought it would be easy. It wasn’t.

Email is a whole different nightmare — MIME parsing, weird threading headers, bounce handling, deliverability rules, SPF/DKIM/DMARC… I spent two weeks just trying to make the agent read an email properly.

And it hit me: everyone building AI agents is going to face this same problem. There’s Twilio for calls and SMS, but nothing similar for email.

So I built it.

You can create inboxes through an API, get webhooks when emails come in, and send replies via API. The agent does the AI work; the system handles all the messy email stuff. It also has a knowledge base, sentiment checks, and auto-escalation for angry customers.

It’s been running in production for a few weeks. I’m polishing the SDK and docs now.

Not launching publicly yet, but I’m looking for a few people to test it out. If you’re building AI agents and struggling with email, or know you will, let’s talk. DM me if you want early access or just want to chat about agent architecture.",heyarviind,1pd4zml,SideProject,03-12-2025,15:02:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pd4zml/voice_agents_were_easy_email_broke_my_brain/

"I live across 4 cities and kept asking friends ""want to swap?"" on WhatsApp — so I built an app for it","**\*\*Background:\*\***

I've lived in Berlin, Tokyo, Hong Kong, and now Lisbon over the past few years. I regularly need to go back to Berlin for 2-3 weeks at a time, and I realized I was constantly texting friends: ""Hey, anyone want to swap places in August?""

The problem? Coordinating this through WhatsApp/Instagram is a mess. And I really, really don't want to use platforms like Airbnb or HomeExchange where strangers stay in my home.

**\*\*What I built:\*\***  [https://swapmates.app/](https://swapmates.app/)

SwapMates: A private home-swap network that only connects you with friends (and optionally, their trusted friends).

Core idea:

\- You invite friends from different cities - When you need a swap, you post: ""I need Berlin in August"" or ""I'm open to anywhere""

\- Only your direct friends see it - BUT they can introduce you to their friends in that city if they vouch for you

\- No public listings, no strangers, no points system. It's like ""borrowing your friend's place for the weekend"" but scaled to the entire friend network.

**\*\*The ""plus-one"" feature:\*\***

This is the part I'm most excited about. Let's say:

\- You want to go to Buenos Aires

\- You don't have friends there, but I do

\- You send a request, I see it, and I can connect you to my friend Maria in BA

\- Maria sees: ""Request from \[Your Name\], friend of \[My Name\]""

\- You two figure it out from there I'm basically the trusted middleman who knows both of you.

**\*\*Current status:\*\***

\- Built the MVP (web app)

\- Completely free (no monetization yet and I want to keep it that way tbh)

**\*\*Where I'm stuck:\*\***

1. **\*\*Onboarding is hard.\*\*** People sign up, see zero friends, and bail. How do I show the potential value before they've invited anyone?
2. **\*\*Cold start problem.\*\*** Friends don't invite their friends unless they see activity first.
3. **\*\*Explaining the concept.\*\*** When I tell people about it, they get it. But getting them to *\*act\** on the invite is tough.

**\*\*What I'm looking for:\*\***

\- Is this solving a real problem for anyone else, or is this just my weird use case?

\- If you travel semi-regularly, would you use something like this?

\- Any ideas for making the ""empty state"" (when you have 0 friends) more compelling?

6 weeks testing Reddit seriously: what I learned that nobody explains,"I’m not trying to game the system. I’m just trying to understand it while sharing small observations from the SaaS team I work with. I’ve been testing Reddit seriously for about six weeks to see how the platform actually behaves.

I expected something simple, but Reddit works nothing like I imagined. A lot of the rules that matter aren’t written anywhere. You only discover them by posting, getting ignored, trying again, and paying attention. Here’s what I’ve learned so far. Maybe it helps someone else who’s trying to understand how to be seen without forcing anything.

**1. New accounts live in the dark**   
  
During the first days, I thought my posts were just not interesting, but the truth was more basic. Reddit barely shows anything from brand-new accounts. Posts get held, filtered, or quietly limited, and you only realize it later when things finally start becoming a bit more visible. It’s not personal. It’s how the system protects itself, and the first week can honestly feel like talking to a wall.

**2. Global karma is decorative. Local karma unlocks visibility**

I hadn’t heard this before testing it myself. You can have decent global karma and still be invisible in a specific subreddit. Reddit seems to ask one simple question: are you trusted here, with these people? A few normal comments inside one sub can do more for visibility than five posts spread across the platform.

**3. Every subreddit is its own ecosystem**

This was the part I underestimated the most. Each sub has different rules, different bots, different moderation styles, and different levels of tolerance. You don’t warm up Reddit as a whole. You warm up one subreddit at a time. Once I started treating each community as its own environment, everything suddenly became easier to understand.

**4. Tone matters more than technique**

Posts written like mini lectures die fast, because people ignore anything that sounds like a teacher talking. If you write like a normal person sharing something you observed, people reply. Reddit reacts to a human tone, not polished expertise, and this pattern was incredibly consistent across subs.

**5. Honest moments beat structured content**

This one surprised me. My clean, well-built posts didn’t do much, while the ones where I shared a doubt, a confusion, or a small failure did far better. Even inside very technical subs, honesty outperforms perfection. People seem to connect more with something real than something refined.

**6. A real question changes the trajectory of a post**

This was the biggest pattern. If I end a post with a real question that invites comparison, people answer. When people answer, Reddit boosts. When nobody answers, the post fades. Comments are the fuel of visibility here, and once you see that, the mechanics of the platform make a lot more sense.

I’m still early in the learning curve, but these six weeks already changed the way I participate here. Reddit feels less like a content platform and more like a group of small communities that open up when you interact genuinely. 

What about you? What did you learn when you started sharing things here?",Due-Bet115,1pd6e0u,SideProject,03-12-2025,15:57:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pd6e0u/6_weeks_testing_reddit_seriously_what_i_learned/

I experimented with quantum randomness for tarot card draws – curious what you think,"One thing I always wondered about tarot readings is randomness.

Shuffling cards by hand is intuitive,
but digital tarot often feels too deterministic.

So I built a small experiment:
instead of using a seeded PRNG,
the card draw is based on quantum-generated randomness.

To be clear — this doesn’t make readings “more accurate”.
For me, it just removes the feeling that the outcome
was influenced by hidden algorithms.

I’m curious:
– do you care how cards are drawn?
– does the source of randomness matter to you?

Built a podcast intelligence system in 1 day - scans 40+ tech podcasts daily,"As an engineer / technologist that's always been on frontier, AI is first time I've had anxiety about keeping up with the news. Had constant FOMO trying to keep up with 40+ tech podcasts over past years. So made [teahose.com](http://teahose.com) to solve it (again, in a day).

What it does:

* Downloads new episodes from curated podcasts (All-In, Lenny's Podcast, Invest Like the Best, etc.)
* Transcribes locally on Apple Silicon (MLX-Whisper)
* Identifies speakers and generates summaries (Claude)
* Publishes to comic-style website (h/t Opus 4.5 the designer)
* Sends daily email digest with AI-generated cartoons (h/t Nana Banana Pro the artist)

Takes about 60 seconds now to keep up every morning. I really is wild this can be built in a day with Claude Code. This would've required a team + weeks two years ago.

Stack: Python, MLX-Whisper, Claude (Haiku + Sonnet 4.5), Nana Banana Pro, Vercel, SendGrid

Tired of spending hours on editing or showing your face? I built an AI tool that generates ready-to-publish faceless Shorts in minutes,"Hey all,

If you're involved in short-form content creation, you know the grind: producing high-volume video is incredibly time-consuming. You have to juggle sourcing visuals, writing scripts, getting voiceovers, and manually syncing subtitles, often using half a dozen different tools and platforms. Even for ""faceless"" content, the effort is massive.

**The Solution: Introducing shorts-lol**

I decided to build a product that collapses this entire workflow. **shorts-lol** is an AI-powered generator that turns a single text prompt into a complete, publishable video short in just a couple of minutes.



# How shorts-lol solves the scaling problem:

* **One Simple Prompt:** Just input your topic idea (e.g., ""Three little-known productivity hacks,"" or ""The history of the fidget spinner"").
* **Complete Automation:** The AI instantly handles the entire production pipeline:
   * Generates the script.
   * Finds relevant, high-quality visuals (stock footage/images).
   * Creates a natural-sounding voiceover.
   * Synchronizes everything and adds perfectly timed subtitles.
* **Instant Output:** You receive a video ready to upload to YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram Reels, eliminating the need for hours of manual editing and tool-hopping.

#  Check out the Product:

* **Platform:**[shorts-lol.com](https://shorts-lol.com)

# 🙏 Looking for Feedback from Builders and Creators

I'm now seeking critical feedback on the user experience and market fit. As fellow builders and potential users, your perspective is invaluable.

1. **Monetization/Pricing:** For a tool that saves hours of labor, what pricing model feels most reasonable: **pay-per-video credit packs**, or a **monthly subscription** based on usage?
2. **Visual Quality:** Are the automatically selected visuals and synchronization quality high enough to meet your production standards?
3. **Missing Features:** What is the most critical feature I should add next to make this a must-have tool for your content strategy? (e.g., brand kit integration, specific music genre selection, foreign language voiceovers?)

Thanks for taking the time to check out **shorts-lol** and share your insights!",hzaki-9872,1pd6yo8,SideProject,03-12-2025,16:18:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pd6yo8/tired_of_spending_hours_on_editing_or_showing/

I realized the Voice AI space is stuck in the ""drag-and-drop"" era (like the old Bubble/Webflow days). It’s too slow.

I built AXIL: an AI-native instruction language and multi-agent runtime for generating complete web applications https://axil.gt.tc,"I am releasing AXIL, an experimental system designed to explore a new direction in software development. AXIL combines a high-level instruction language with a multi-agent execution runtime that generates production-grade web applications from specifications rather than from manually written code.

What AXIL is:
AXIL is an AI-native instruction language. Instead of writing traditional code, the user defines goals, constraints, use cases, and project structure through compact directives such as SPEC_GOAL, SPEC_USECASE, OUTPUT_PROJECT, BUILD_COMPILE, and AUTO_FIX. The runtime then coordinates multiple AI agents to plan, generate, validate, repair, and finalize web projects automatically.

Why this matters:
AXIL shifts the development process from writing implementation details to describing intent. It enables a single developer or small team to produce complex applications by leveraging parallel AI strategies, self-repair loops, and automated validation. The system aims to reduce boilerplate, accelerate prototyping, and demonstrate what a future AI-driven programming paradigm might look like.

Current status:
AXIL is in an early stage. The instruction set is defined, the browser-based runtime is functional, and a basic demonstration is available. The system can generate multi-file web outputs, including pages, components, styling, and routing. Feedback on design, language structure, limitations, and potential extensions is welcome.

You can view the demo at:

Hustled up a word game app using AI tools,"My sons had an idea for a word game, so I spent some time over Thanksgiving holiday coding it up. Initially with the help of AI tools that generate entire apps for you, but then I had to take a finer approach when I connected things like a database to the back end. I have experience in web development but it hasn’t been the focus of my career for a while. These AI tools make it easy to put together a really nice looking little game, even though I’m definitely rusty on the particulars (and I’ve never been good at the UI design aspects).

Sharing my little side project: a free instant ID/passport photo tool I built,"I wanted to share a little side project of mine — it’s actually not new. I started building this **Instant ID Photo** tool back in April 2024. At first I had the classic indie-dev dream of maybe making a bit of money from it, but eventually I gave up on that idea and let it sit.

Recently I checked on it again, refined it a bit, and realized people were *still* using it. Even with almost no marketing (basically just dropping a few Reddit comments), there was a tiny but steady trickle of users downloading results, and the feedback I got here was very positive.

So I figured I should share it properly this time so more people can actually find it:

👉 [**https://instant-id-photo.com/**](https://instant-id-photo.com/)

It’s super easy to use — literally one click and your passport/ID photo is ready. It supports multiple countries, and everything is processed **on your device**, so nothing gets uploaded.

You can download **either a single photo** or a **ready-to-print 4×6 inch collage**, so you can still print it at a pharmacy or Walmart, but you *don’t* need to pay them $15+ just to take the photo for you (and honestly, in my experience, their quality is often worse).

One heads-up: **don’t use it on mobile** — the background removal quality is lower because of device computation limits. Desktop (with Chrome) works best.

Anyway, it’s free, simple, and I’m glad it’s been genuinely useful to the small group of people who found it by accident.

"Got tired of copy-pasting Claude’s responses into other models, so I built an automatic cross-checker for AI agents","Recently, I’ve been running Codex alongside Claude code and pasting every Claude code response into Codex to get a second opinion.

It worked great… I experienced FAR fewer bugs, caught bad plans early, and was able to benefit from the strengths of each model.

But obviously, copy-pasting every response is a pain in the ass.

So, I looked for ways to automate it. I found just-every/code and some similar tools, but didn't like how they completely replace Claude Code.

I tried having Claude call the codex MCP after every response, but there were a few reasons why I stopped using this approach:

1. Codex only sees whatever context Claude decides to send (usually not enough)
2. Each Codex call is a fresh thread, so it has zero memory of the repo, task, or what has already been discussed with claude. Can’t have a real multi-turn discussion.
3. I can't interact with Claude until Codex finishes.

I wanted a tool that was separate, automatic, persistent, and non-invasive (no MCP or CLI wrapper), but couldn't find anything.

So I built [Sage](https://github.com/usetig/sage) – an LLM council that runs in a separate terminal and watches your coding agent in real time, automatically cross-checking every response with other models (currently just Codex, Gemini & Grok coming soon).

\- 10 email sequences

\- Full guides for Product Hunt, Hacker News, IndieHackers

\- Launch tracker to see what's actually working

\- 24-hour launch checklist (so you don't forget anything)

\- Anti-patterns guide (learn from my failures)

The concept is ""Wordle for Curiosity"". The questions are about common phenomena we often ignore (e.g., ""Why do we only see one side of the moon?"" or ""Why does baby crying sound so stressful?"").

"I created a React package to generate invoice templates, what do you think?","Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a project I’ve been working on and get some honest feedback.

I built a React package that exposes an editor component you can plug into either a blank project or directly into your existing app. This editor isn’t just a visual tool.

You can actually write real React/TSX code directly inside it. As you type your React code, the editor immediately updates the preview, so you can build and tweak your invoice template in a very natural and intuitive way.

Once you’re satisfied with the template you created inside the editor, you can download the generated TSX file and add it to your project. The package also provides a method that takes any data you want (you define the structure), and it will generate a PDF invoice based on your custom React template.

I’m wondering if this kind of tool would interest people. Many projects need to generate invoices, but I don’t know how common the need is for fully customizable, React-based templates.

If you have any thoughts, feedback, or criticism, I’d really appreciate it. Thanks!",VermicelleMeet,1pd9w68,SideProject,03-12-2025,18:05:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pd9w68/i_created_a_react_package_to_generate_invoice/
The Moment I Realized “Marketing Problems” Usually Aren’t Marketing Problems,"A couple months ago I was talking with a founder who was convinced her company had a *lead generation* problem. Sales were slowing, traffic felt stagnant, and the team kept bouncing between random tactics hoping something would stick.

But the more she explained, the clearer it became that leads weren’t the root issue at all.

Her marketing team was creating content without knowing what sales actually needed. Sales was chasing deals that didn’t match the company’s positioning. Leadership kept shifting goals quarter to quarter. Everyone was working hard, but no one was working in the same direction.

It reminded me a lot of situations I’ve seen over the past decade. I’ve run my own business, worked inside others, advised teams, watched companies grow and stall… and I swear the same pattern repeats:

Most “marketing problems” are really alignment problems.

When a company is small, misalignment is survivable. When it starts growing, the cracks widen. Teams drift. Messaging breaks apart. The brand becomes a collection of disconnected activities instead of a coherent direction.

I’ve learned this firsthand, to the point where I now spend a chunk of my time helping companies untangle that exact knot in my side project, ѕtrаtеցіс﻿ꓑеtе, which is essentially me stepping in as a fractional strategist to get teams rowing in the same direction. But this story isn’t about the service, it’s about the moment something clicked for me.

Back to that founder.

We spent a few hours mapping the customer journey, comparing it to the actual day-to-day operations. Everyone in her company was talented. Everyone cared. But nobody had a shared mental model of what “good” looked like.

Once we aligned the team, just clarified targets, messaging, responsibilities, and actual metrics, things changed fast. The external tactics (SEO, content, paid, whatever) finally had a structure to sit inside. Suddenly the “lead problem” disappeared without any dramatic new marketing campaign.

It made me realize how much of growth is less about the flashy stuff and more about the quiet, internal mechanics no one sees.

Not every project needs a rebrand. Not every slow quarter needs new software. Sometimes the real fix is simply getting everyone to agree on what the company is actually trying to say and who it’s trying to reach.

Anyway, that conversation stuck with me. Just felt like sharing it here in case someone else is in that murky “we’re doing everything but nothing’s working” phase.

Sometimes the answer isn’t more, it’s alignment.",Honest_Alps1628,1pd9qn5,SideProject,03-12-2025,18:00:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pd9qn5/the_moment_i_realized_marketing_problems_usually/
Not your typical side project — but it helped me score 20/20 on the Canadian citizenship test 🇨🇦✅,"Quick disclaimer first: this is just for practice — you still need to read the official guide. That part matters.

While studying, I noticed almost every practice site gives only 1–2 free test sets before hitting a paywall. I just wanted repetition, not another subscription.

So I built a simple tool with 20 free practice sets using the most common questions. I added quick buttons to jump to ChatGPT or Perplexity when you get something wrong, plus local storage to save wrong answers so they’re still there next time unless you remove them.

Funny outcome: my wife went through the questions overnight, didn’t read much else, and scored 15 — just enough to pass.

Would you use an app that helps you turn startup ideas into a real roadmap?                       help me Validate or shoot me down:),"Hey! I am 21 years old, still in college, and I’m working on an app concept for young founders called **Launchpad**, and I’m trying to validate whether this solves a real problem before building it.

The core features are simple:

# • Swipe through business idea cards

A Tinder-style feed of “half-baked” startup ideas with difficulty, cost, virality score, etc.  
Swipe to skip or save the ones you like.

# • Turn any idea into an AI-generated roadmap

Tap an idea OR manually put yours in, AI gives you a plan with daily actionable tasks  
(5–20 minutes each).  
The goal is to help people stay consistent and actually ship something.

# • Daily build screen

Each day unlocks a new task. (gamified)  
You mark it complete and track your progress/streak.

# • Networking with other builders

Match with people building similar ideas or at a similar stage, more like  
“build buddies” than cofounders. (Invite to your Launch and share tasks/notes)

Basically:  
**A focused way to go from idea → plan → daily execution → launch.**

# My question:

Would an app like this actually help you stay consistent and finish a project?

Also:  
What features would make you excited to use it?  
And what would make you lose interest?

I Built a Tool That Turns Basic Product Photos Into High-End Photoshoot Images,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been working on a project called **Claporo**, and I just recorded a quick demo video showing how it can turn a simple, basic product photo into a professional photoshoot-style image in seconds.

**🔧 Why I Built This** Most AI tools force you to choose between generating from scratch or just filtering existing photos. But creators (especially e-commerce owners and designers) need flexibility: sometimes you have the perfect product shot, and sometimes you just have a vision in words. That’s why Claporo is built around **two core pillars**: advanced **Image Mixing** and precision **Prompt-Based Editing**. The interface is designed to let you use them individually or together for total control.

**🧩 What Claporo Includes**

* **Dual-Core Engine:** AI Image Mixer & Prompt-Based Editor (the main features)
* **Image Generator:** Create new assets from scratch when needed
* **Community Gallery:** A space to see what others are creating
* **20 Free Credits:** Monthly allowance for new users

Built 'Letterboxd for concerts' with no dev experience. 30 users. What now?,"I moved to NYC to work at a Unicorn startup & realized everyone around me was going to concerts constantly. Weekend plans always included going to a concert in BK or seeing a show.  
  
I started going to a few myself and instantly saw the appeal.

The thing is, everyone I knew tracked their concerts through the notes app or in a spreadsheet. My friend had seen 100+ shows and couldn't remember half of them. There was no way to look back and see their favorite shows of the year or to see fans highest-rated show for an artist.

With apps like Goodreads, Letterboxd, and Beli blowing up, I kept thinking - *why doesn't this exist for live shows?*

So I built *Encore - concert collection*!

I spent the last 6 months building it solo - no co-founder, funding, or technical experience, just grinding through development from scratch. It's basically Letterboxd but for live music - rate/review every concert you've been to, share photos and setlists, see the highest-rated shows across all artists and venues.  
  
Encore got approved for the App Store and has \~30 users (friends) but I have no idea if this will resonate with anyone outside my bubble.

My growth strategy is to go into artist-specific communities with the mission of finding the best concert of all time. The idea is to turn ratings into a debate/competition that fans actually care about.  
  
A few questions where I'd love brutal honesty:

1. Encore is completely free. How would you approach growth with a $0 marketing budget? Should I bite the bullet and partner with influencers?

2. Is ""finding the best concert ever"" actually compelling or gimmicky? I'm worried it comes off as self-promotion disguised as engagement.

3. Would you actually use something like this? 

Happy to share the app, answer questions about the build, planned features, and take any feedback!

"My Honest Review of RankinPublic , A Fun New Way to Launch Products","Hey Builders ,

I recently discovered **RankinPublic**, a new indie product launch platform, and I’m genuinely impressed. The platform runs **product tournaments** 🏆 kind of like a football bracket for products and it’s such a smart idea.

Here’s how it works:

* Each tournament starts with **16 products**.
* Products compete daily, advancing based on **user votes/scores**: 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1 in the final.
* This gives every product **fair exposure** and ensures the best ones truly shine.

  
What’s really cool is that in the tournament I joined, [StackRender](http://www.stackrender.io) , my own AI-powered database schema generator took **first place**! 🎉

I love **RankinPublic** approach because it’s :

* **Fun & engaging** – users actively participate in product voting.
* **Fair** – the best products rise naturally.
* **Great exposure** – your product gets noticed by the right audience.

Highly recommend checking it out, whether you’re a creator or just curious about the latest indie products.

The Making of QXPlayer — Part 1:,"I want to start a series of posts about how I created QXPlayer — an audio player for macOS, and later for iOS.  
These are not marketing stories, but the real history: problems, fixes, mistakes, and everything that pushed me forward during development.

By 2017, I had already spent more than ten years working on macOS.  
In that time, I tried dozens of music players — lightweight, heavyweight, “audiophile”, trendy…  
and every single one of them had the same strange issue that Apple still hasn’t solved.

Playing one file — easy.  
But playing an entire folder as is, without creating playlists, without “importing into a library”, without losing the structure — that turned into a quest.

You copy an album onto a drive → you want to simply open the folder → press play → and listen.  
But macOS players kept pushing their own rules: generating temporary playlists, reshuffling tracks, losing files…  
And a week later you couldn’t even remember where you copied the music and what was playing there.

I often remembered the Winamp days,  
where you opened a folder — and everything played exactly as it was on disk.  
Simple. Predictable. No surprises.

And right around that time, I started learning Objective-C and diving into macOS development.  
And for the first time in years, I had a thought:  
“Why not build a player I would actually enjoy using every single day?”

But immediately two real problems appeared.

**Problem #1 — I was a beginner in macOS UI**  
This was the very beginning: first steps in Objective-C, first windows, first buttons.  
Skill level: “how do I make a button react at all?”

**Problem #2 — I’m a very demanding listener**  
I don’t listen to music on a soundbar or a Bluetooth speaker.  
I use A-class amplifiers, tube gear, reel-to-reel decks, vinyl, proper speakers.  
And once you get used to warm, alive, analog sound —  
the standard macOS AVPlayer feels like plastic.

I needed a player with low-level control,  
clean output, precision, no system artifacts,  
and most importantly — real gapless playback that doesn’t ruin albums with clicks.

And right then, luck knocked on the door.  
I accidentally stumbled upon COG, an old open-source player,  
where I could peek into how low-level audio output works on macOS.  
It was the perfect bridge between two worlds:  
my love for audio,  
and my 10+ years of low-level C++ gamedev experience.

With that C++ background, massive new possibilities opened up.  
I realized I could build not “just another player”,  
but my own audio engine — with a foundation that would sound exactly the way I wanted.

I started experimenting, dissecting system APIs, building tests, writing C++ code, learning audio buffers…  
and step by step, the first working low-level engine appeared — the one that later became the heart of QXPlayer.

And what happened next —  
and why I almost quit because of the design…  
👉 all that in the next part.

GitHub - necdetsanli/EyeRest: A lightweight Windows tray application that helps you follow the 20–20–20 rule by reminding you every 20 minutes to rest your eyes and look into the distance.,"I’ve been dealing with eye strain from long coding / screen sessions, so I built a tiny side project to scratch my own itch and turned it into a polished little Windows app.

# What it does

**EyeRest** is a lightweight tray application that helps you follow the 20–20–20 rule for eye health:

>

Once running, it sits in the Windows notification area and:

* Shows periodic desktop notifications (Windows 10/11 toast when available, tray balloon as fallback)
* Lets you configure the reminder interval (e.g. every 5–60 minutes)
* Lets you enable/disable reminders from an **Options…** dialog
* Optionally allows **left-click on the tray icon to toggle reminders on/off**
* Can (optionally) remember your settings across sessions and **start with Windows** for the current user
* Has a small **About…** dialog with version / author / privacy info

No windows stay open on the desktop; it’s just a tray icon + notifications.

# Tech / implementation details

For anyone curious about the stack:

* **.NET Framework 4.8 + WinForms** tray app using `ApplicationContext`
* Background scheduling with `System.Threading.Timer`, marshaling back to the UI thread via a helper `Control`
* Toast notifications via `Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp.Notifications` with a safe fallback to tray balloon tips
* Two tray icons: normal + “snoozed” state when reminders are disabled
* MSI installer via **Visual Studio Setup Project**
* MSIX package for **Microsoft Store**
* No services, no drivers, no registry hacking beyond what the installer needs

# Privacy

* No telemetry, no analytics
* No personal data is collected, stored, or sent anywhere
* Everything runs locally; it only shows notifications and small dialogs

I also added a [`PRIVACY.md`](http://PRIVACY.md) and documented this clearly in the repo / README.

# Where to find it

* **GitHub (source + releases):** [https://github.com/necdetsanli/EyeRest](https://github.com/necdetsanli/EyeRest)
* **Microsoft Store:** EyeRest – 20–20–20 Reminder [https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9MW31PJW185Q](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9MW31PJW185Q)

I’m also working on Chocolatey / winget packaging so it can be installed via package managers as well.

If you try it, I’d love to hear:

* Any UX tweaks you’d make for a tray-only app
* Better ideas for snooze / interval controls

I’m building an AI that lets you talk again with someone you lost using your actual WhatsApp/iMessage history,"Alright Reddit, I need some honest perspective before I launch this.

I’m building something called ""Remorar"", and the idea is simple but heavy:

You export a WhatsApp or iMessage chat → Remorar learns it → and you can talk to that person again.

Not AI pretending. Not a generic chatbot. But the real tone, slang, nicknames, inside jokes, and the tiny relationship habits that only existed between you and them.

It even notices the natural time patterns you both had like evening check-ins or morning greetings and mirrors that timing on its own. Nothing you schedule. Just familiar rhythms resurfacing.

And honestly… so many of us have old WhatsApp backups or exported chats from people we’ve lost just sitting there, untouched, locked away with memories we can’t really interact with. Remorar gives them a voice again.

I tested the first version on my dad’s exported chat.

The way it echoed his warmth and timing hit me harder than I expected.

It felt like a moment I didn’t know technology could give back.

Remorar is for people who’ve lost someone they loved and miss the way they used to speak.

Not to replace them but to keep a small piece of that connection alive.

Is this comforting, uncanny, helpful… or something the world actually needs?

I first tried using Blogger. It worked, but only in the most minimal sense: limited API, awkward editor, styling hacks, and it never really integrated well with the app.

So I tried storing blog posts directly in Firestore. Structurally, this made a lot more sense: I could define my own fields, use markdown, fetch posts in realtime, and keep everything inside Firebase.
The problem was: I still needed a small editor to manage the content.

I looked at FireCMS next. It’s powerful and flexible, but for my little blog use case it felt oversized. Lots of tables, modals, model configuration… great tool. just not the simple “edit some markdown and save it to Firestore” flow I needed.

So I ended up building my own tiny CMS: **Firelighter CMS** (fl-cms).
It stores the schema inside your Firestore project, keeps everything client-side, and uses an intuitive editor (bytemd) so I can just write. It still uses the data models from firecms, which you can insert from templates. They are only editable in a json editor to keep things simple.

I paused the project for almost two years, but recently picked it back up and released v0.1.2. It’s MIT-licensed, minimal, and still evolving. but it solved my own problem well enough that I figured I’d share it.

What’s next

I plan to use fl-cms in a couple of upcoming Firebase apps. anywhere I need small, self-hosted content editing without spinning up a full CMS.

With cleaner subcollection support it's easier to add, multi-language content.

If you’ve built something similar -- or solved content editing in a different way inside Firebase apps -- I’d love to hear how you approached it.

I built a homework worksheet generator for my stepson. Would love feedback.,"My stepson’s school barely gives homework anymore, but he’s pretty behind and really needs the extra practice. I started looking for worksheet sites, but most of them felt outdated, full of ads, or took too many steps just to make something simple.

I’m not a developer, but I ended up building a small tool that instantly generates clean, printable worksheets (math, reading, spelling, etc.) for grades K–8. It started as something just for him, but I’m sharing it here in case it’s useful for other parents or teachers.

I’d really appreciate honest feedback:

* Does the worksheet layout look clear?
* Are the grade levels too hard / too easy?
* Anything confusing or missing?
* Would you actually use something like this?

Market Validation - Paycheck to Paycheck Budget App,"Hi everyone!

I’ve been building a budgeting app as a personal side project, and before I take it further I want to understand whether something like this would actually be useful to people who budget seriously and want to improve their financial planning without the complications.

The goal of the app is to give people budgeting tools without requiring an account, cloud syncing, or sharing data with any company at all. Everything is stored locally on the device and fully encrypted. No ads, no tracking, no nonsense.

Right now it supports:
- Multiple income sources
- One-time and recurring expenses, with “paid” and “partially paid” tracking
- Savings goals with timeline projections and feasibility checks
- Debt tracking with interest rates and payoff strategies (snowball/avalanche)
- Insights for different time ranges (current, 30/60/90 days, custom)
- Financial advice generated from the user’s own numbers
- Custom categories and personalized settings
- Light/dark themes
- Full offline usage

Before I release this publicly, I’d like to validate whether this kind of approach actually solves real budgeting pain points.

If you use budgeting tools, I’d love to know:

1. Does a privacy-first, local-only budgeting app appeal to you?

2. What’s missing from most budgeting apps you’ve tried?

3. What budgeting tasks do you do regularly that apps never seem to handle well?

4. How important are things like savings guidance, debt payoff suggestions, or spending insights?

5. Would you want optional paid features (like advanced insights or encrypted local backups), or prefer everything to remain simple?

6. Are there any dealbreakers or must-have features for you personally?

I’m not trying to promote a product at this time, I am just trying to validate whether the idea has real value and to understand what people actually want before I keep building and put money into getting this into the app stores type deal!

I built a tool to annotate PDFs by voice because I was tired of typing.,"Hi everyone,

I spend a lot of time reading papers on my phone (usually on the commute or in bed), and I’ve always found the annotation process painful.

Whenever I have a thought or a critique, I have to stop reading, highlight the text, and struggle to thumb-type a long comment on a tiny keyboard. Half the time I just give up and tell myself ""I'll remember this point later"" (I never do).

So, I spent the last few weeks building a tool to fix this. It’s called **PDF Voice Annotator**.

**How it works:**

1. You upload a PDF.
2. Click anywhere on the document.
3. Speak your comment.
4. It uses AI to transcribe your voice into a text comment instantly.

It’s free to use and has a **""Guest Mode""** with limits (you don't need to create an account or sign up to use it).

My app is about to reach 1000 registered users,"What have I built, and how is it going?

I’m a software engineer, and last year I wanted to build something that solved my own problems and made me feel good while working on it. I discussed a few ideas with friends, especially ones where AI could be used in a meaningful way, and eventually decided to build a product in the fitness category.

When I looked at other apps, I noticed they hadn’t integrated AI effectively. Most of them collected a large amount of personal data and then generated workout plans using static algorithms running in the background.

In reality, at my own gym I kept noticing some real problems:

* Trainers write workout plans on paper and hand them to users. Most users don’t even know what the listed exercises are. For example, if someone doesn’t know what a Leg Press is, they search Google or ask the trainer every single time.
* Personal training sessions are expensive. I respect the work, but the cost is high.
* Tracking workout summaries is inconsistent and usually messy.

So I decided to build an app that generates personalized workout plans using AI as the core of the product. I also wanted users to understand every exercise and learn the correct form. I purchased nearly 6,000 exercise animations and enriched all metadata using AI. This enrichment process alone took almost three days. After that, I integrated everything into the system.

Last year I launched the web platform first. Within three months we reached 80 users, but almost all feedback said the same thing: “We want a mobile app.” So between December 2024 and May 2025, I developed the mobile app. In May, I published **LoadMuscle** on both iOS and Android.

This was my first mobile app experience. Poor ASO, weak UI, missing localization, and so on. I spent the first months fixing everything myself and kept adding new features until August. Then I realized something important: the features I added weren’t meaningful to users. I wanted to truly understand what they needed, so I decided to focus only on updates driven by **user feedback**. That changed everything. When you reach out to a user, listen to them, and make them feel like the app belongs to them, they rarely leave. That is what I’m trying to do now.

To promote the app, I opened social media accounts and started producing content. But I still haven’t managed to reach the right audience organically. Since I live in Turkey, TikTok only shows my videos to Turkish users. If I manage to grow on YouTube or Instagram, I’ll share the results later.

So far, we only ran ads on the App Store for one month. But since fitness keywords cost more than $1 per click, I paused the campaign. I’m planning to try Meta and Google Ads next.

After launching on mobile, I disabled login on the web interface. For the past month, I’ve been fully focused on SEO. With ready-made workout programs and a large exercise library, I have a lot of valuable data, and I’m using it to build SEO-rich content. Since my CTAs are placed properly on the website, visitors coming from Google usually download the app directly.

Overall, this project has been an amazing learning journey for me, and it still is.

What I aim for with LoadMuscle is simple: when someone decides to improve their body in a healthy way, I want them to feel that this app is there to support them. Here’s what the app currently offers:

* AI-powered **workout planner** (we don’t ask 30 personal questions)
* More than 4,000 exercise animations with instructions for proper form
* Ready-made workout plans for muscle growth, fat loss, cardio, strength, and more
* Workout history tracking
* Body measurement tracking

In the **free plan**, users get three AI-generated workout routines each month.

I built a circular day planner because I kept lying to myself about having time,"Three months ago I had 8 tasks and ""plenty of time."" By 6pm I'd finished 2.

I wasn't failing at productivity. I was failing at math.

I'd scheduled 14 hours of work into an 8-hour day and called it ""optimistic planning.""

So I built DayZen. Your entire day = one circle. 24 hours visible at once.

**Here's what changed:**

Drag a task onto the circle. It fills real space. Add another. Eventually the circle fills up.

When two tasks overlap, they glow red.

That's it. The math is right there, calling me out.

**The moment it clicked:**

My usual Tuesday: deep work (3hrs), standup (30min), client call (1hr), lunch (45min), more deep work (2hrs), gym (1.5hrs), team meeting (1hr), cook dinner (45min).

The circle showed me I'd need 26 hours.

I wasn't running out of time. I never had it to begin with.

**What it does:**

* Entire day visible at once (no scrolling)
* Overlaps glow red instantly
* Syncs with your calendar
* When the circle is full, it's full

Launched my first real product on Product Hunt. Here’s what I learned (as a solo builder),"Today I launched the first product I’ve ever built solo on Product Hunt: [Norte](https://norteapp.io/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic), a “wallet benefits brain” that helps you see all the perks & protections your credit cards already include (without linking accounts).

It wasn’t a huge launch... but I am grateful and happy with it.   
  
I learned a ton that I wish someone had told me earlier, so here it is:

**1. Product Hunt is brutal and humbling**

I already knew this... but not to this extend. 

I was expecting that most of my network votes won't count as full upvotes... but not so brutally. 

PH filters out “unqualified” upvotes, hides comments, and prioritizes organic **external** traffic.

I got more comments than many top-10 products... but most won't show publicly. Many people I know showed me screenshots of their comments but I can't see it from my profile... so I can't even respond.

Still, the experience was worth it.

**2. Reddit outperformed EVERY other channel**

I’ve tested Google Ads, LinkedIn, X, communities, Slack groups…

Nothing compares to Reddit. Two organic comments in the right subreddits brought me \~50 signups alone.

Even on launch day, I got 4 new signups from PH. Reddit sent 10+ users today!

Builders sleep on Reddit.

**3. Ship even if you aren’t “big”**

I’m a solo founder with a small audience in most social channels. No team. No investors. No big community.

And still... real people used the product, asked questions, shared feedback, and found value.

The launch didn’t “go viral”, but it made Norte real.

**4. Handling user feedback matters more than upvotes**

I spent most of the day responding to every comment, DM, question, and bug report.

That taught me more than analytics ever could:

* One bug confused a user about Magic Link signup → fixed it
* Someone pointed out a broken benefit link → now fixed too
* A traveler shared the exact moment Norte helped him avoid duplicate insurance

Upvotes feel good, but these conversations create product direction.

**5. Launching is not the finish line — just clarity**

I told myself this before the launch day... The best part of launching wasn’t the ranking.

It was understanding:

* who the real users are
* which features matter
* what copy lands
* what feels confusing
* and what to focus on next

Launch day simply compresses months of learning into 12 hours.

**6. If you’re building alone, launch earlier than you think**

You don’t need perfection... I thought I needed it.

I waited 6 months polishing, tightening RLS, rewriting UIs, adding onboarding... yet the most valuable insights came after real users touched it.

Launch → listen → adjust.

If anyone’s curious about the process, how PH treated different votes, or what I’d do differently next time, happy to share.

And if you’re building something alone — I’d love to see it.

Keep going.

Whether you’re in top 5 or #33, shipping takes courage.

Not trying to sell anything, just want to receive feedback on this idea and your consensus on how you think the world will move forward in this space.

I’m building a tiny tool to help with impulse spending by adding a simple 5 second pause. Here is my early work and I would love some feedback.,"I have been working on a small side project called MomentPause. It comes from my own struggle with impulse spending, especially on days when I am stressed or mentally tired. Most budgeting tools make me feel worse, not better, and the shame spiral tends to push me into even more small purchases. I wanted something gentle that interrupts the moment without judging me for it.

So this is what I am trying to build.

MomentPause is a very simple tool. Before buying something, you tap a button and the app gives you a short five second pause. You get a calming visual, one soft question that helps you check in with yourself, then two choices. Buy it or skip it today. Both choices are valid. There is no guilt here and no lectures. You also get a tiny positive moment for pausing instead of rushing (a dopamine boost reward for pausing, regardless if purchase is made).

It is meant to be calm, supportive, and easy for anyone to use. It should help with stress spending, late night shopping, boredom buying, ADHD overwhelm, or any moment where emotions take over.

I put together a basic landing page that explains the idea. This is still very early, but here it is: [https://momentpause.carrd.co/](https://momentpause.carrd.co/)

What I want to find out:   
1. Would you use something like this?  
2. Is there anything confusing on the landing page?  
3. Any suggestions for features or improvements?  
4. Would you want this as a mobile app, a widget, or a browser extension?

I would really appreciate any thoughts. I want to keep this gentle and helpful, not preachy or complicated. If you have built anything related to habits or spending, I would love to hear what worked for you and what did not.

Started a cron job monitoring tool today. Looking for early feedback.,"Hey everyone,  
This is my first post here. I started working on a project today, and since I’m a student from Hungary doing my first “bigger” thing on my own, I’d really appreciate any advice or feedback.  
  
The problem:  
Cron jobs and scheduled tasks often fail quietly. Backups, invoices, scripts, data pipelines, etc. You usually only notice something is broken when it has already caused damage.  
  
The idea:  
A simple heartbeat-style monitoring service. Each job hits a unique URL when it runs. If it does not ping within the expected time window, you get an alert.  
  
On top of the basic ""did it run on time"" check, I am considering features like:  
\- Per-job run history (success/failure, duration)  
\- Simple anomaly detection on runtime (e.g. much slower or faster than usual)  
\- Basic output/log checks (e.g. look for error patterns in logs)  
\- Optional runbooks attached to a job, shown in alerts (""here is how to debug this"")

Existing tools:  
Healthchecksio is solid and reasonably priced, but the UI feels a bit dated to me.  
Cronitor is very polished, but the pricing looks high for small teams or students.  
  
I am aiming for something in the 0 to 50 USD per month range that is easier to get started with and feels more modern.  
  
Tech stack:  
C++ backend (probably overkill, but it is what I know best), React frontend, Postgres for storage.  
Target is to have a first MVP in about three weeks.  
  
What I would like feedback on:  
Would you use something like this in your own projects or at work?  
Which features actually matter in practice? For example:  
Slack/Discord/email alerts  
Dashboards and uptime history  
Runtime anomaly detection  
Dependency graph or grouping jobs into workflows  
Anything else you feel is missing from existing tools  
What would feel like a fair price point for this type of service?

  
Thanks for reading and for any input you are willing to share.",VividRestaurant7700,1pdeq7z,SideProject,03-12-2025,20:59:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pdeq7z/started_a_cron_job_monitoring_tool_today_looking/

I built a real-time crime mapping platform for my city using NLP + geocoding. Got 0 customers after cold outreach. What am I missing?,"I spent 3 months building an automated crime data platform for my city in Brazil (350K pop).

**Tech:** Python scraper → SpaCy + Olama (classifies crimes) → Nominatim geocoding → Vue 3 + Leaflet map

**Works great technically:** 1000+ incidents processed, 14 crime types, interactive map, time-series analysis

**Sales crashed:** Tried selling to real estate agencies (""safety score reports for properties""). Got ghosted, rejected, or talked to chatbots. 3 days in, I'm emotionally drained.

**Legal concern:** Original plan was public map, but worried about property devaluation lawsuits + privacy laws.  


What I've learned

  ✅ I can build complex data pipelines (scraping + NLP + geocoding + visualization)

  ✅ I can pivot products based on constraints

  ❌ I suck at sales (3 days broke me)

  ❌ I might be solving a problem nobody has

  ❌ Building something technically impressive ≠ building something people want



**Questions:**

1. Is this anxiety-inducing vs actually useful?

2. Would YOU use it when moving to a new neighborhood?

3. If you had to monetize this, how?

**Be brutally honest.** Cut my losses or keep going?

"55K views on TikTok, 5 paying users. Built a 140/year mental health app for men. What am I missing?","I'll keep this real because I need actual feedback, not validation.

Built MIRRORD over the past year. It's a mental health app specifically for men who don't connect with traditional therapy approaches. No ""how does that make you feel?"" No meditation bells. No affirmations. Just AI that asks hard questions, remembers your conversations, and shows you patterns you keep repeating.

The idea came from my own frustration. Every therapy app I tried felt like it was designed for someone else. They all wanted to validate my feelings. I wanted something that would call me on my bullshit.

**Where I'm at:**

* 5 paying users at $139/year
* 378 TikTok followers, one video hit 55K views
* 259 Instagram followers
* 5.0 App Store rating (2 reviews)
* Zero funding, completely bootstrapped

**What's working:**

Content resonates. Videos about why traditional therapy doesn't work for men get engagement. The ""no agenda, no bias, no judgment"" angle hits. The people who actually try the app seem to stick around.

**What's not working:**

Views aren't converting to downloads. I've burned money on Meta ads that went to bot traffic and wrong demographics (was reaching 65+ year olds instead of my target). Social proof is thin. Two reviews isn't enough for most people to take a chance.

**The positioning:**

Priced it at $139/year intentionally. Not trying to be the cheapest option. Calm and Headspace charge $70/year. BetterHelp charges $300/month. I wanted to sit in between: premium enough that it attracts people who are serious, accessible enough that it's not therapy prices.

The core differentiator is the ""no agenda"" angle. Human therapists have biases, religious views, political opinions, cultural blind spots. AI doesn't. It just asks questions based on what you actually say.

**What I'm looking for:**

Honest feedback. Roast the positioning, the pricing, the approach. Tell me what would make you actually download something like this. Or tell me I'm solving a problem that doesn't exist. Either way, I'd rather know now.

"I kept mass amounts of tabs open for weeks just to remember things, so I built a Chrome extension that adds notes and reminders to tabs","I'm that person with 50 tabs open, not because I need them all, but because closing them means forgetting why I opened them.

""I'll read this later."" ""Compare this before buying."" ""Send this to my wife."" Except later never comes, and the tabs just sit there. For days. Sometimes weeks.

So I built Tidy Tabs - a simple extension that lets you attach notes and reminders directly to any tab. Add context, set a reminder, actually close the tab, and move on with your life.

It's free, 100% local (no accounts, no tracking, nothing leaves your device), and it's my first extension - so I'd genuinely love brutal honest feedback.

* **track progress:** log tiny wins and reflections each day so you can actually see yourself improving, even when it feels invisible.
* **community support:** you’re not doing this alone  others are working on the same small steps, sharing progress, and encouraging each other in a safe, low pressure environment.
* **build social skills:** practice starting conversations, handling awkward moments, and connecting more confidently.
* **slow, manageable growth:** no pressure for overnight change  just small, consistent steps that add up to real confidence.

I recently launched my very first SaaS application ([https://accountit.finance](https://accountit.finance)). It is an expense and income management tool.

I’ve been tracking my personal finances for over three years, and earlier this year I wanted to switch to an existing app (before that, I was using a Laravel admin panel).

Unfortunately, none of the apps I tried (web-based and native iOS) met my needs, so I decided to create my own.

Right now, it includes several core features, such as:

* Multiple account management
* One-time and recurring transactions
* Categories and merchants for better organization
* Data import/export
* A ticket system for feedback and feature requests

I built a notes app that lives inside your keyboard (free on iOS & Android),"Hi everyone,  
I’m an indie dev and I built a small side project called **MemoKey** \- a notes app that lives directly inside your keyboard.

The idea came from a simple pain point:  
I kept switching apps just to copy my bank number, email templates, or hashtags. It was annoying, so I built something to fix that.

# How it works

You save your text snippets in the app → then open the MemoKey keyboard → tap a note → it pastes instantly in WhatsApp, Gmail, Slack, anywhere.  
No more jumping between apps.

# Key Features

* **Quick Access:** Tag, pin, and organize your snippets
* **Paste Anywhere:** Custom keyboard connected to your notes
* **Backup (optional):** Sync to Google Drive or iCloud
* **Extras:** QR code generator + text-to-speech reader
* **More Goodies:**
   * Quick Generate QR codes from any note
   * Built-in library of **70,000+ text emojis** (cute kaomojis & symbols)
   * **Customizable themes (Pro)** so you can personalize the keyboard
   * And many more small utilities waiting for you to discover

# Privacy (important for keyboard apps)

I know third party keyboards can feel sketchy, so I made this **offline-first**:

* It does **not** log keystrokes
* It does **not** collect analytics or tracking
* I don’t even use Crashlytics, no data leaves your device
* The only time anything goes online is if *you* choose to back up to your own cloud

It’s completely free on both iOS and Android.  
If you have feedback, ideas, or things that annoy you, I’d love to hear them.

GoodNutritions a Flow-style health & nutrition tracker built around food logging and daily insights,"Hey everyone 👋

GoodNutritions is a food and health tracking app that works a bit like cycle apps such as Flow, but instead of focusing on periods, it focuses on your nutrition patterns and how they affect how you feel.

# What the app does

* 🍽 Food logging made easier Log meals by scanning food labels, barcodes, taking a photo, or just typing.
* 📊 Daily dashboard See your calories, macros, water, caffeine and more in a clean, simple overview.
* 🔁 Nutrition cycles & timeline Track things like:
   * days with lots of sugary foods
   * meat-heavy days
   * drink-only days
   * hydration patterns
* 💬 Health insights Get small, readable cards such as:
   * “Why you might feel bloated today”
   * “What your sugar cravings might mean”
   * “How long today’s caffeine is likely to last”
* 📈 Progress view See weight trends, streaks, and progress over 30 / 90 / 365 days.

# Why it exists

Most calorie apps just throw numbers at you.  
GoodNutritions focuses on patterns and explanations, how what you eat shows up as symptoms, energy, cravings, and long-term habits.

If you try it out, feedback is very welcome:  
bugs, confusing screens, or ideas for future insights are all super helpful. 💚

I just built and launched **BWF (Bet With Friends)** \- It is basically a social platform where you can also create, track, and settle peer-to-peer wagers with your friends.  It has an API tied to betting odds and updates continuously.

I am not a professional developer but have it built so far on a web app and android (hopefully will have it on iOS soon)

**So, what makes it different from DraftKings/FanDuel:**

* Bet against your actual friends, not the house
* Sports, crypto prices, or literally anything custom
* Real accountability - no more ""forgetting"" to pay up
* Available on Android (iOS coming soon)
* Free to use
* HAS Premium upgrade that enables users to get advanced betting analytics and ANYONE ACTION wagering (allows you to create a wager and throw it out to public for others to join in on.  i.e. If you are willing to bet $5 on the Cowboys vs Lions game and willing to accept wagers from 5 different users on that bet, you can do so)
* Additional features included a buzz section, bragging rights timeline, chat module, records & analytics, and custom wagering
* BWF is a p2p engagement site; NOT a sportsbook
* BWF does NOT act as a house; there is no vig on any wagers.  I simply have a platform fee for monthly usage (5% of your total monthly wagers) which helps covers the APIs used for the betting odds.  BWF Premium members are not subjected to any platform fees, and the monthly member costs $10)
* If you do not want to bet for money, there is a completely free option of bets called, ""BragOffs"" that allow you to wager and shame friends simply with bragging rights

I built this because I simply wanted a fun & engaging way to bet with my friends group in a bragging rights way, with REAL winnings on the line AND keeps vegas/house out of it.  Would love feedback from this community!

I built **NightTwin** during a recent hackathon, an AI tool that matches your nightlife vibe by finding ""**doppelgängers**"" of **your perfect night out**.   
  
You describe your night in natural language (e.g., *“Crazy club in Belgrade with beer, 3 friends, 2am, under 100€”*), and it parses intent, embeds semantically, and recommends venues with explanations based on historical data.  
  
🧩 **The Problem**  
Nightlife planning is mostly trial and error, vague reviews and star ratings don’t really capture your **specific energy, budget, or chaos level**.

You get generic, top-rated places, not *your* vibe.  
  
✅ **The Solution**  
NightTwin uses **OpenAI** (GPT-4o-mini for parsing + embeddings for similarity) to:

* Extract **structured queries** from messy prompts
   * city, time, budget, party level, tags (e.g., “smoking inside”, “student crowd”, “live Balkan music”)
* Search over preprocessed **“nights”** built from Google Maps data (ethically scraped, aggregated only)
* Rank venues by **semantic + structural similarity** and explain *why* they’re a good twin

Guardrails ensure the prompt makes sense (e.g., real cities, feasible times), and the output is a ranked list of venues with short **“why this fits you”** explanations.  
  
**Repo:** [https://github.com/MilanSazdov/Night-Twin](https://github.com/MilanSazdov/Night-Twin)

👤 Personalization: Not Just “Best Bar Near Me”

I’m also experimenting with a **taste profile** that learns from previous searches: if someone keeps asking for *cheap student bars with Balkan music, smoking allowed, open late*, I don’t want to send them to a fancy ballroom just because it matches “live music + drinks”.

NightTwin aims to:

*Note: rakija is an strong alcoholic drink*

* Build a **“taste vector”** from past queries (crowd type, noise, price sensitivity, music, etc.)
* Use it in ranking so two people typing *“rakija and beer bar”* don’t get the same place
* Act as a **local discovery engine**, boosting small/new venues that are a better vibe match, not just the ones with thousands of reviews

🤖 Why Not Just GPT + Google Maps?

LLMs + Google Maps often give you the **most-reviewed, keyword-matching** spots.  
Type *“rakija and beer bar in Belgrade”* → you get something like Ribar (bar/club) because it has high rating + many mentions of “rakija” and “beer” – even if it’s touristy and not your crowd.

NightTwin tries to go beyond that by:

* Using **semantic understanding** of your whole prompt (vibe, chaos level, who you’re with, time, budget)
* Adding **user-level personalization** from previous sessions
* Adding a **local bias** toward under-the-radar places when they’re a better fit. 
* Same city, same keywords – different user → different doppelgängers.

🔑 Key Features (Current & Planned)

* **Fuzzy prompt → structured intent**
   * e.g. “cheap Balkan student bar, smoking allowed, Novi Sad, Saturday 11pm” → city, budget, crowd, music, smoking, time
* **Semantic + structural similarity**
   * Embeddings over reviews/descriptions + filters (hours, price range, tags).
* **Transparent explanations**
   * “We recommend X because: similar vibe, open till 3am, mostly student crowd, fits your budget.”
* **Personalization (WIP)**
   * Learn from past searches to adapt future recommendations.
* **Local-first discovery**
   * Don’t just surface the top tourist traps; highlight smaller places when they match your taste vector.

Launched new extension last day!,"I have build a extension that does not require sign up, no ads, no premium (built for every day user )

What it does: The tool will help to snooze the tabs that are open, and when ever you want it back you can open it back.

Other features: When you close the tab and if it's in the group ( don't worry ) the tab will find its way back to its own group.

Future features: we are working on adding smart identifier ( if there are similar tabs open )
4 YouTube for ex... you can close all 4 YouTube tabs at once.

If you want to give suggestion or additional feature feel free to ask us out. We are happy to get feedback...

What we are expecting: we really want you to give honest review, good or bad and if bad what particular thing so that we can fix it for better use.


Thanks

Looking for developers and artists to help build an interactive pixel-art mythology world (inspired by Floor796),"I’m working on a long-term creative project called **Planet900**, and I’m looking for a small group of people who are interested in helping me build it. The concept is an interactive, multi-realm pixel-art world inspired by the structure and presentation style of Floor796, but with a completely original setting, story, and engine.

The project mixes worldbuilding and development. The world is divided into nine mythological realms (Norse, Greek, Egyptian, Chinese, Celtic, etc.), each with layered floors, characters, entities, and events. The emphasis is on small animated scenes, environmental storytelling, and hidden interactions that connect the different realms. We already have a detailed lore foundation, an event system, a realm model, and an initial folder structure.

Technically, the goal is to build a browser-based interactive viewer for animated pixel-art scenes made from looping MP4 tiles, plus a simple internal editor for floor layout and event triggers. The engine will likely use TypeScript, Canvas/WebGL, and JSON-based data for realms, floors, entities, hotspots, and events.

I’m looking for people interested in contributing in any of these areas:

– Pixel artists (still images or simple looping animations)  
– JavaScript developers  
– Web animators or Canvas/WebGL developers  
– Worldbuilders or mythology enthusiasts  
– Sound designers  
– Writers who enjoy collaborative lore building  
– Anyone who likes building unusual web projects

This is an unpaid, collaborative, hobby-scale project. I’m keeping all code open under MIT and all art/lore protected under a separate license, but contributors will be credited clearly for whatever they create. The goal is to gradually build an explorable world together rather than rush anything.

The repository is already set up with documentation, event systems, data models, and initial worldbuilding. If you’re interested, reply here or send a message and I can share the details. I’m looking for people who want to experiment, create, and build something visually and narratively interesting over time.

"We built an app that uses AI to visualize your dreams and analyze them using Jungian & Freudian psychology - IOS, Android","Hi everyone,

I’ve always been fascinated by dreams, but I found that traditional dream dictionaries are too generic. Looking up ""snake"" or ""falling"" in a book gives you the same answer as everyone else, ignoring your personal context.

We built **Ruyanla** \- actually this journey started first with hackathon. Later, I told my friend and he said let's build it. So, it turned into a side project designed to act as a dedicated dream journal that does two main things:

1. **Contextual Analysis:** Instead of generic keywords, it uses AI to analyze your dream narrative based on psychological frameworks (Jung and Freud) and even neuro-scientific context.
2. **Text-to-Visual:** It generates an image of your dream so you can actually ""see"" the memory before it fades. You can also add your own images to make it more concrete memories.

**How it works (as seen in the video):**

* You log the dream details (symbols, emotions,image sytyles).
* The AI breaks down the symbolism tailored to your life situation.
* It generates a permanent visual artifact of that dream.

I’m looking for honest feedback on the onboarding flow and the quality of the interpretations. The app has a free tier and credits are for image generation since we are using a high quality model.

Ever struggled to remember Design Patterns? I made a flashcard app,"I’ve noticed that design patterns are *a bit underrated* compared to the value they actually provide. And no surprise, there are quite a few, the theory behind them is considerable, and it takes real motivation to learn (and *remember*) more than just the common ones.

Sometimes you just want a quick reminder or a fast way to double-check a core idea, without opening a book or digging through a long article.  
  
I asked myself: *how can this be more approachable?*  
**Flashcards** felt like the right answer: Fast to learn, even faster to recall when needed.

I've combined personal notes, GoF book, RefactoringGuru and a few other trusted sources. AI was used to improve memory retention expressions and pseudocode.

"I built a reverse job board out of unemployment rage. It’s not done, but I need people to break it.","I’ve been unemployed long enough to grow a whole personality about it, so instead of crying into job boards every day I built my own platform out of spite. It’s called CandidateSeekers and the idea is simple: **you don’t apply to companies, they apply to you. EVEN if your currently employed, it's kinda like headhunting for passive candidates.**

The problem is… I’ve reached the point where I can’t test anything else with fake profiles. I need actual humans clicking around because dummy data never tells me where the real pain is.

This is not a polished launch. This isn’t even a “beta.” It’s more like: *if this website were a person, it would still have soft spots on its skull.* I need people to open it, explore, and tell me where it’s confusing, where it’s annoying, where it feels like to much, and where it’s shockingly decent.

If you’ve ever been ghosted by an ATS, rejected by a bot before a human even knew you existed, or spent hours applying to a role just to get the “thanks but no thanks” email 4 seconds later, congratulations! You are exactly the person I built this for and the person whose feedback I need.

If you’re down:

1. Make a free ***CANDIDATE*** account (I don't need **SEEKERS** right now, just ***CANDIDATES***)
2. Build your profile like you actually mean it
3. Tell me everything that sucks so I can fix it

There’s no payment. No upgrade button. No shady “limited free trial” dark pattern. I literally just want to make a hiring platform that doesn’t feel like psychological warfare.

**Step 3**: Record the whole process and put it on TikTok in some 15 second-ish video-people seem to love watching people actually doing things  
**Step 4**: Use a combination of the actual sticker, the content around the sticker and then the discussion generated about how well this worked to drive people to your app.

Reading about validation frameworks. Watching startup YouTube. Tweaking landing pages no one visited.

Here's where I'm at now:

* $1.8K MRR
* 57 successful payments
* 80% of sales coming from organic channels

Just SEO, DMs, LinkedIn posts and building in public.

I won't pretend I have it figured out. Half the time I'm fixing bugs at midnight or second-guessing my pricing.

But every Stripe notification still hits different. Someone I've never met decided my thing was worth paying for.

What's worked so far:

* Shipping beats planning. Always.
* 10 happy users > 100 lukewarm signups
* Sharing the journey keeps you accountable when motivation dips

"After 5 failed SaaS products and nearly quitting, I finally made 600 euros with pure SEO (here's what I learned)","**TL;DR:** Built Top10, a Product Hunt + Trustpilot hybrid. Made $650 with zero marketing budget using only SEO. Almost gave up on indie hacking before this worked.

# The breaking point

I was done. Seriously done.

Five SaaS products. Five failures. Each one felt like proof that maybe indie hacking just wasn't for me. The grind of building, launching, crickets... rinse and repeat. I was one more failed launch away from updating my LinkedIn and going back to a ""real job.""

# Then something clicked

Instead of building another random SaaS, I looked at what actually frustrated me: launching products is hard. Getting reviews is harder. Finding trustworthy products to buy? Even harder.

So I built **Top10** \- basically if Product Hunt and Trustpilot had a baby.

**Here's how it works:**

* Makers launch their products and earn points through engagement
* They get exposed to thousands of beta users during launch
* After launch, they can collect reviews and ratings
* Top-rated products get featured to buyers actively looking for solutions

# The part that shocked me: $650 from pure SEO

I had $0 for marketing. Not being dramatic - literally zero budget.

So I went all-in on SEO:

* Researched what people actually search for when finding products
* Optimized every product page for discoverability
* Made sure user-generated reviews added fresh, keyword-rich content
* Let the platform's structure do the heavy lifting

**Result:** People started finding the site organically. Traffic grew. Conversions happened. $650 in revenue without spending a dime on ads.

# Why this worked when the others didn't

Looking back, my previous 5 SaaS products failed because:

1. **I built solutions looking for problems** \- Not the other way around
2. **I had no distribution strategy** \- ""Build it and they will come"" is a lie
3. **I ignored validation** \- Assumed people wanted what I was building

Top10 worked because:

* **Two-sided marketplace = built-in growth** \- Makers bring products, products attract buyers, buyers attract more makers
* **SEO compounds over time** \- Every new product listing = more indexed pages
* **Solved a real problem** \- People genuinely struggle with product discovery and validation

# What I'd tell myself 5 products ago

* **Launch ugly and iterate** \- Top10's first version was rough. Ship it anyway.
* **SEO > Paid ads for bootstrappers** \- Especially when you're broke
* **Marketplaces are cheat codes** \- Users create your content and growth flywheel
* **One success erases five failures** \- Nobody remembers the products that didn't work

# Current status

The platform is live, growing organically, and actually generating revenue. Not retirement money, but it's proof that this can work. For the first time in my indie hacking journey, I'm not questioning whether I should quit.

**For anyone on their 2nd, 3rd, or 5th failed product:** The next one might be the one. The only guaranteed way to fail is to stop trying.

I'm so tired of not getting sh*t done,"As someone with ADHD, I've been having a tough time following through on my tasks - especially things I don't want to do (amazon returns, setting up healthcare, etc...).

That's why I built Space Tasks. It's a gamified todo list that makes it fun and easy to get things done.

**Here's how it works:**

🚀 - You are the captain of a ship, and your goal is to chart a path across the universe by exploring as many new planets as you can.

🪐 - Every task you add represents a new signal from an un-contacted planet. When you want to actually do that task, we beam you to the surface.

🌋 - On the surface, we automatically break your task into steps, with each step representing a region of the planet to explore.

🦊 - For each step, your first mate (AI assistant) will provide you with helpful tips and information.

✨ - Once you done all of the steps, and fully explored the planet, we add the planet to your Star Map and you can explore the next one!

Our goal is to help you actually complete your tasks. This is still definitely a work in progress and would love your feedback (Please tear it apart)!

The story behind building my first app,"About a month ago, I realized I was sick of losing all these random interesting ideas that pop into my head during the day and just straight up forget by evening.

I decided to find a mobile app that'd let me record my thoughts by voice and somehow structure them. Tried a bunch - Cleft, Whisper Memos, AudioPen, Voicenotes and so on.

Some couldn't figure out the note type from the content, others sucked at handling non-English voice, and in others u couldn't even understand the real value without buying a subscription.

That's how I came to the idea of building my own app. For me it's more than just notes, it's like an organizer at this point.

Really love making something that me and my family actually use!

So far I've implemented these features:

* Support for 99+ languages
* Automatic note type detection
* If it's a reminder note, it automatically adds an event to ur calendar. Pretty convenient to just say ""meeting day after tomorrow at 11"" and boom - u got a ready event with a reminder
* For task notes, ability to add to Todoist
* Daily Reminders - at the end of the day the app reminds u about notes u made today
* Calendar where u can view notes by day or all at once by type
* Web version for extended work with notes
* Export as plain text or markdown

I also wanna add the ability to share links through Share Extension and build notes based on them - I do this a lot - but haven't figured it out yet.

Decided not to build the perfect product - a month of dev is already a lot for a launch - and gonna publish to the App Store.

This is my first publish, hope it goes well.

I built a free Figma-like editor for gradients that exports to CSS/Tailwind for your next sideproject,"Hey everyone,

When I was building my first few side projects, I struggled so hard to make the landing pages look aesthetically pleasing. I would design a gradient background in Figma, but trying to actually replicate that exact look in CSS was a nightmare... I could never get the blend or the positions right. So I built Aurora Backgrounds to bridge that gap.

It’s a layer-based editor (works just like Figma) where you can add, drag and blur shapes and colors visually. But unlike a design tool, it’s built for the web so it exports clean HTML with CSS or Tailwind classes.

It is 100% free. I just wanted to solve this workflow for myself and thought it might help you guys too.

A new take on personal finance: what we found that actually drives financial wellness,"My cofounder and I are 25 and live in NYC. We both had the same issue: that we struggled to get a good grip of our finances. We both tried your typical personal finance apps, but for some reason, we ended up not using them after a month or two. You kinda just forget they exist eventually… but since we wanted a good solution, we decided to build one.

We started by conducting ~30 hours of interviews with our peers (younger professionals, mostly 23-34) to understand their problems and view on personal finance. Alongside this, we studied academic research about what actually predicts financial wellbeing. 

The findings were:
Confidence predicts behavior better than objective knowledge.
Emergency savings matter more than almost anything else.
Consistency beats optimization: people with good habits feel less anxious than those who make big, sporadic moves.


If we are going to create a better solution, we need to really understand what the problem is with the current alternatives. Most finance apps obsess over ratios and spending categories. The research says that's not what drives how people actually feel about money. And our interviews confirmed it, nobody asked for better budgeting or concrete investment advice. All they wanted was to feel like they're making progress. I like to see it as moving the focus away from accounting to wellness.

So we built something with your wellness score at the center. You connect all your accounts, and the score tracks 7 subjective factors for financial wellness. About 70% is behavioral/psychological, 30% is traditional metrics.

The whole thing is powered by AI that has your full financial picture, remembers your goals, and can pull real-time info when you need it. So you can ask it anything and it actually knows your situation.

One user described the problem perfectly: ""I have anxiety about financially sleepwalking."" That's what we're trying to solve. 

Curious what everyone’s thoughts are around what true financial success really means for you? We had a lot of mixed responses on this in our interviews.

"Built NomadTime - A timezone tool with ""Pain Score"" to stop scheduling cruel meetings","Hey everyone! Just launched my first side project and would love feedback.

**What it is:** A timezone converter with a twist - it has a ""Pain Score"" system that shows who's suffering when you schedule meetings across timezones.

**The Problem I Was Solving:** I kept accidentally scheduling 2am calls for teammates. Standard timezone converters just show you the times - they don't tell you that you're being cruel.

**Key Features:**

* 🟢 Pain Score ratings (Green = good, Yellow = meh, Red = someone's suffering)
* 📍 Sweet Spot Scheduler finds the fairest time for 2-6 people
* 🌍 Standard timezone converter + world clock
* 🔗 Shareable links with preselected zones
* ⚡ PWA - works offline, installable on mobile
* 🚫 Zero ads, zero tracking, completely free

**Tech Stack:**

* Built as a PWA (installable on mobile)
* \[Add whatever you used - React? Vanilla JS? Framework?\]

**Link:** [timezoneconvertertool.com](http://timezoneconvertertool.com)

**Looking for feedback on:**

* Is the Pain Score concept actually useful or gimmicky?
* Any features you'd want to see?
* Does it work well on your device?

Built this in 2 weeks and launched today. First real side project I'm putting out there!

Pivoting to affiliate programs? (Some web dev involved),"Hi Reddit,

Last weekend, my partner and I decided that on top of our regular web apps, we'd like to switch more to a marketing app to capitalize on Amazon's affiliate program. What this app does is to use openai's api to recommend gifts (based on the user they described) that can be found on Amazon and refers the user to products with our affiliate link.

These are some new waters for us and we will have to lean heavily into marketing for this one.

What I want to know is if anyone else has any experience in this area and would like to give any pointers.

"I built a tool that generates quick neighbourhood reports for any UK postcode (crime, rent, schools, transport, noise). Looking for feedback.","Hey everyone,

I’ve been slowly building this little side project called **RentCheck**, and I finally pushed a working version online. It generates a neighbourhood report for any UK postcode things like crime levels, average rents, school quality, transport, noise, etc.

I made it mostly for myself because every time I was trying to evaluate a new area, I had to piece things together from a bunch of different sources.  
So I tried to put it all in one place.

# 🔍 What the current live version actually does right now

# ✓ Crime score

Uses official Police UK data by LSOA.  
Shows category breakdown + a simple score.

# ✓ Rent estimate

Uses official government datasets (ONS / LSOA medians).  
It’s not perfect yet, especially in London — the resolution isn’t very “street-level”.  
(No distance-based weighting in the live version yet.)

# ✓ Schools

Uses Ofsted data for England.  
(Scotland doesn’t use Ofsted, so that part isn’t covered yet.)

# ✓ Transport accessibility

Nearest stations, distance, and some basic heuristics.  
(Not full GTFS-level accuracy, but usable.)

# ✓ Noise

Noise maps currently work only for Scotland (DEFRA data is different for England, still in progress).

# ✓ Overall report summary

Pulls everything together into a simple “area overview”.



# ⚠️ What’s NOT in the live version yet

Just to avoid confusion:

* No real-time listings / distance-weighted median
* No London-specific rent adjustments
* No improved affordability logic
* No advanced rankings we worked on today
* No extra datasets for England noise
* No Scottish school scoring
* No external providers (PropertyData) yet

All of that is currently being reworked locally, but the version on the website is still the older stable one.



# 🧪 What I’d love to get feedback on

1. Is the idea itself useful?
2. What’s confusing or unnecessary in the report?
3. What information would you expect to see when checking an area?
4. Should I add things like comparison mode, favourites, or an export option?
5. Is the UI readable or too dense?

Built a tiny MVP for a parking idea (SwiftCar) – is this useful or should I kill it?,"I’ve been thinking about a startup around **cars + parking lots** for a while and finally forced myself to ship a tiny MVP instead of just doom-thinking in Notion.

The MVP is called **SwiftCar** and it’s here:  
👉 [**https://swiftcar.app**](https://swiftcar.app/)

Not a “launch”, not polished, no monetization — just an experiment to see if this space is still worth digging into.

The idea in plain terms:

* Make it less annoying to deal with **parking / parking lots**
* Eventually evolve into smarter stuff around **parking behavior and EV usage**

On the site there’s a **short survey built in** (no email required, no tricks). If you’re willing to help:

1. Click around SwiftCar for a minute
2. Answer the survey questions on the site

Things I’d especially love feedback on:

* Would *you* ever use something like this? In what scenario?
* Is the value prop even clear, or does it feel vague?
* What’s the one feature you’d expect from a parking product that’s missing here?

Brutal honesty is welcome — “this is pointless because X” is better than polite silence. Just trying to decide if I double down on this or move on to a different problem space.

I spent 35 days building a SaaS nobody wanted. So I built the tool I wish I had.,"Hey guys!  
I hope everyone reading this is having a good day!  
I spent 35 days building a SaaS nobody wanted - so I built the tool I wish I had. 

A few weeks ago I shipped DomainFlow - ""Stripe for custom domains."" - I fell in love with the idea.

Built auth, webhooks, SSL automation, the whole thing. Result: 2 signups. $0 revenue. 

The problem wasn't the code. The problem was I never validated. I was stuck in a comfortable vibecoding bubble, adding features instead of talking to real people. Marketing looked complicated and I didn't know where to begin - this caused me to just stay in a little bubble where I would just add and add features without even the chance to know wether they were solving an actual issue for a user

So I'm building [ValidateIRL](http://validateirl.com)

Instead of AI giving you fake validation scores e.g: 

* ""Validation score: 8.5/10""
* ""Market opportunity: HIGH""
* ""Founder-market fit: STRONG"" 

or the AI giving you a broad range of competitors that all have enterprise solutions and differenciated products which solve different aspects of the problem

You get: - x amount of actual social posts (reddit, hackerrank, forms) from people complaining about your problem and helps you find communities where your 

\> Real links you can click and verify 

\> Personalized launch roadmap based on YOUR validation data

\> Templates to reach out 

\> Tracking: contacted -> replied -> ""I'd pay"" 

\> Then when you're validated, it helps you launch to those same people and manages your marketing - giving you goals and making sure you are actualling solving a painkiller problem - not just making a vitamin solution. 

Just shipped the landing page: [validateirl.com](http://validateirl.com) and Building the MVP over the next 2 weeks. Will start to share my progress here.

* Browse topics to see evolving knowledge from the whole community
* Reply to entries to add your perspective
* Your contributions are tracked (opt-in credit)

Why this matters:

Right now, millions of people solve the same problems in isolated ChatGPT windows. All that knowledge disappears. Jornadia captures it.

Trello meets investment research,"I spent the last 10+ years working as an equity portfolio manager and an institutional allocator to hedge funds.
For a long time I was obsessed with finding a tool to automate a team's research. I eventually realized that was the wrong goal. good investment research is non-linear and creative. every thesis is unique, so you can't just feed it into a standardized factory line.

However, the workflow is often a mess. most analysts operate in a chaos of 50+ browser tabs, scattered excel models, and disconnected notion notes.

I built ThesisBoard to solve this. it is basically Trello meets a curated directory of financial tools and workflows.

What it does

It gives you a structured workspace for your research, backed by a community library of:

1. Templates: step-by-step boards for different styles (e.g. ""equity deep dive,"" ""crypto protocol analysis,"" or ""macro thematic"").

2. Tools: a directory of 100+ specialized research tools (like Tegus, Quartr, or specific FRED datasets) that are mapped to the relevant stage of your workflow.

3. Prompts: tested AI prompts for financial analysis that you can run directly within your research cards.

The key utility is context. when you open a card for ""competitive analysis,"" the board automatically serves up the exact tools and prompts you need for that specific step, instead of you hunting for them.

The community aspect

Because research is hard, we made the workflows shareable. you can publish your analysis along with the exact steps you took to get there. others can then ""fork"" your process to build their own thesis.

Example

I just published a bullish thesis on Google using our ""Equity Analyst"" template. you can see how the board guided the process from the initial idea to the final recommendation:

https://thesisboard.com/community/analysis/cmiqfdw9m0001ochq...

Tech stack

Next.js, prisma, postgres, and tailwind.

I’m currently in beta. I would love to know what specific workflows or templates you would find useful, or if you think the kanban approach fits this domain.

"Wanted an app for creating video highlights using iPhone, so I created one myself.","Around two months ago, while playing squash with my friend, I got an idea. We often recorded full sessions, and as you can imagine, trimming out the best moments was a pain. My phone had to be plugged into a power bank, storage kept filling up — overall, not a great experience.

I also play a lot of Counter-Strike, where I use an app called Medal to clip the best moments, but only *in-game*. I did some research and realized there was no app that lets you save the last for ex.: 30 seconds of real-life video using your watch.

Friend wants to fund my project - should I take it?,"I’m a college student bootstrapping a small software project (0 revenue so far). A friend (also a student) offered to invest some money he made from crypto (markets are down and he wants to move it into something else).

Cash would definitely help, but I’m worried about mixing friendship + equity this early.

Should I take money at this stage?  
If so, how would you structure it (loan, SAFE, small equity, etc.)?  
If not, why avoid it?

Spent the week writing docs for my project — didn’t expect it to change the product this much,"I’ve been building Relae (a developer tool) for a while now, and this week I forced myself to do something I’ve been avoiding for months:

I sat down and actually wrote the documentation.

Not rough notes. Not a TODO list. Real, structured docs.

And it honestly changed the way I understand the project:
	•	If I struggled to explain a feature, it meant the feature wasn’t actually clear.
Writing things down exposed gaps I’ve been glossing over.
	•	Docs act like a mirror.
Stuff that felt “obvious” in my head suddenly wasn’t obvious at all.
	•	It made the project feel more real.
Even though no new features shipped, documenting it made everything feel more tangible.
	•	It forced me to slow down.
I’ve been in nonstop build mode; writing docs made me step back and view it from a user’s perspective.
	•	It actually reduced a lot of my stress.
Most of the things I thought were product problems were really just documentation problems.

If anyone’s putting off the docs—I get it. But giving it the attention it deserved genuinely helped me see the whole thing more clearly.

A tool to help turn messy meeting notes into clear tasks and expectstions.,"Hey all.

I have been working on a small project over the past couple of weeks to solve a problem I kept running into at work - mainly because I'm a bit of a scatter brain and easily overwhelmed. 

I would leave meetings with notes that were messy, incomplete, or just not particularly clear which I would find a nightmare to decipher later on. I would regularly second guess myself and have to resort to asking colleagues for clarification.

I did a bit of research and found chat GPT and various other AI helpers. 

I ended up building a small prompt that takes rough meeting notes (extremely rough in my case), and would change them to;

clear responsibilities

deadlines

deliverables

hidden expectations

clarifying questions

a short follow-up message you can send (not perfect)

and a clear task breakdown


It started as something just for me, but a couple of people I showed it to said it made their meetings way less stressful.

I put everything into a little prompt pack/template in case anyone else wants to try it out.
Link is in my Reddit profile (have been told not to link here)

If anyone here also struggles with this  or has ideas on how to improve it, I’d love feedback. Happy to show what it's capable of. 

(Disclaimer - am copy/pasting this on other reddits as would like to get it out there, I truly believe this works and is different to many other AI helpers as it's quite niche and not a general helper) 

Sorry that I'm not giving it for free, I would love to, but wouldn't mind seeing if making money this way is viable.

I built a free tool to turn painful XML Schemas (XSD) into readable HTML documentation.,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been working with legacy systems and SOAP APIs recently, and I found myself constantly squinting at raw .xsd files trying to figure out the data structure. Most existing tools were either expensive enterprise software, heavy desktop apps, or required me to sign up.

So I built XSD Viewer to solve this for myself and others.

What it does:

It takes an XSD file and generates a clean, interactive HTML data dictionary. It visualizes the hierarchy, elements, attributes, and types (like sequence vs choice) so you don't have to parse the XML logic in your head.

Privacy: This was a big priority. The tool processes files in-memory and discards them immediately. No files are ever stored on the server.

Who is this for?

It's mainly for developers, architects, or analysts who need to integrate with XML-heavy standards (like banking or government APIs) and need to quickly understand the schema or share it with non-technical stakeholders.

It's completely free and requires no login. I’d love to hear your feedback on the layout or if you run into any XSD structures that don't render correctly!

\- Your code controls bet sizing, target selection, bankroll management

\- Simulation runs at 100K+ bets/second using Web Workers

\- Yes, I understand that no amount of creative programming can last indefinitely against a house edge. This is about optimization, competition, and fun.

\- This is not a casino, there is no gambling taking place,

**Some questions I'm trying to answer:**

\- Is the onboarding clear enough? (I added an interactive tutorial)

\- Does the multi-leaderboard system make sense or is it confusing?

\- What would make you come back and try again?

How to schedule Pinterest posts for side hustle without daily work,"I sell Notion templates as a side hustle. Was trying to create pins every day after my 9 to 5. Always felt rushed and exhausted.

The batch creation mindset is totally different too. When I'm in ""creation mode"" for 3 hours straight, the quality is way better than 20 minutes here and there.

Sales from Pinterest stayed consistent around $840/month but my stress level dropped dramatically. The side hustle actually feels sustainable now.

BOOMER REACTS!,"🎮💥 BOOMER REACTS to Modern Gaming — Learning It ALL Remotely at Age 72 💥🎮 

Hey everyone! I just launched a gaming reaction channel with my 72-year-old dad, and he is not your typical gamer. 😅 Actually he's not a gamer at all. I had to drag him kicking and screaming into this. A few months ago he was diagnosed with a rare cancer called NETS. His girlfriend of 15+ years left him and he doesn't have a lot of prospects. 

He moved from Minnesota down to Texas to be closer to his grandkids — while I still reside in Minnesota. I convinced him there is a market for this kind of channel and that he might be able to support himself with a modest revenue from YouTube if we can build an audience.

 Since then, I’ve been teaching him everything remotely through Discord: OBS… Audacity… Voicemeeter Banana… controller basics… recording workflows… Watching a Boomer learn all this modern tech has been equal parts chaos, comedy, and heart! 

To break him in, I started him on The Last of Us — a masterpiece classic! I plan on then having him play through its sequel upon completion of the original. Seeing him react to it for the VERY first time has been both wholesome and absolutely wild, and it’s the perfect intro for someone his age stepping into modern gaming. 

He’s already excited to let the audience choose what games he should react to next so long as it isn't mindless violence for its own sake (It'll be hilarious when/if GTA is requested - I'll twist his arm). Your feedback will literally shape the future of the channel. 

👉 Every subscription helps him cover basic living expenses and cancer treatments. 

👉 ALL revenue from this project goes directly to him. 

He’s working incredibly hard to learn this stuff — not for fame, but to provide for himself and build something authentic that people can enjoy.

Spent 6 months building a receipt scanner that auto-syncs to Google Sheets. would you use it ?,"Hey everyone!

I've been wrestling with a problem that I'm sure many of you can relate to: the nightmare of managing and tracking receipts. Whether it's for personal budgeting, freelance work, or small business expenses, the process of manually entering data from a pile of paper receipts is tedious and time-consuming.

I've always wished for a simple, no-fuss solution that could just scan a receipt, extract the important information, and send it straight to a spreadsheet. After searching and not finding exactly what I wanted, I decided to design it myself.

After spending countless hours manually entering receipts into spreadsheets (and losing track of way too many expenses), I built ReceiptSync - an AI-powered app that does it automatically.

Here's how it works:

Snap a photo of any receipt

AI extracts merchant, date, amount, tax, items, and category  
Data syncs instantly to your Google Sheets  
otal time: \~3 seconds

I've been testing it for the past month with a small group, and the feedback has been incredible. People are saving 5-10 hours per month on expense tracking.

The app handles:

•Restaurant and grocery receipts

•Gas stations and retail stores

•Online order confirmations

•Pretty much any receipt format you throw at it

I'm opening up 100 whitelist spots for early access before the public launch.

The waitlist is called ReceiptSync and it’s here:

How I figured out ProductHunt - #1 and #3 on consecutive launches,"[My launches](https://preview.redd.it/up1im2syk35g1.png?width=1518&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbb9cf22ea15c3ecbd0a9ccf508c72aa30025525)

I got a #3 (426 upvotes) finish for my first launch in July and a #1 finish (583 upvotes) for my second launch a few weeks ago. I spent at most 1-2 hours setting up each launch.

**What is important?**

* Make sure your logo looks professional and isn't too big/too small. It's the only thing people see before clicking on a product, so you're competing with everyone elses logo. Please make sure you logo isn't generic or obviously AI-generated before launching your product.
* The tagline is extremely important. In my case, I used ""The open source Google Analytics replacement"" because my app is an open source web analytics platform.
   * I roughly followed the ""X for Y"" format which piggybacks off an established brand people know about. This only works when you're comparing yourself to a product everyone knows about! I've seen people reference an obscure product and it never works.
   * There's a good chance this can be the same as your hero text on your landing page, so hero text best practice apply here too.
* Make sure your screenshots do a good job of showing what your product does.
   * I was fortunate enough to have a product that has a lot of screenshottable pages. so I didn't even create any graphics. I straight up just uploaded the raw screenshots.
   * Don't be afraid to upload 5+ images if you have good ones.
* DM some about a dozen friends and family members early on the launch date and ask them for support. This is a pretty low effort way to get a little boost without unfairly gaming the system too much.
   * Apparently ProductHunt will devalue upvotes if it's from a referral. So it might help to ask your friends to go find your product on ProductHunt organically.
* This is obvious, but make sure you have a product that is actually good. No matter how much prep you do you can't brute force your way to a #1 finish if your product looks like crap.
* Don't get scared and delay your launch by months or years! I got approval to able to relaunch just 4 months after because I had released major updates. After 6 months, you can re-launch without approval. Many successful companies have launched 5+ times over the years.

**Less important, but still worth doing**

* Put some effort into your the first comment PH tells you to add. Just copy the format of the top launches of the month/year and I think you'll do fine,
* Put the ""Launching on ProductHunt"" badge on your site during the launch. If your site already has traffic, this could help give you a boost.

**When to launch**

Tuesdays and Thursdays are apparently the busiest days on ProductHunt. If you win on these days, congrats! But it is definitely the most competitive and launching on the weekends is a better bet if you want to face weaker competition.

I launched on a weekday for my first launch and I ended up a few votes behind the second place. So on the second launch I did it on a Sunday (lowest traffic day of the week) and I easily got a first place finish.

But no matter what, there's no way to perfectly to time your launch. If Cursor or Figma decide to launch on the same day, you're screwed no matter what.

**What I didn't do:**

1. Get ""hunted"" by someone. A lot of launches have hunters. I still don't know what this means, but I guess I didn't need it.
2. A lot of people spam people on Linkedin in the weeks before their launch and ask people to upvote their launch when it comes. This probably does work, but it's a lot of effort. There's a lot of other things that have better ROI.
3. Pay those Indian guys that message you saying that they will help you get to #1
   1. It's not a scam since they do make a post, but it's a waste of money.
4. Pay for a fancy launch video. This probably helps, but it's not mandatory for a top finish if you do other things well.

**What I got from these launches**

1. I got a massive traffic spike both times - around 3,000 new website visitors
2. I also got over 100+ signups on both launches
   1. I noticed that the quality of signups from ProductHunt is really bad. Many people didn't finished the onboarding and the free -> paid conversion rate was terrible. This makes sense because the PH audience does not have high intent, but it was jarring nonetheless.
3. I got a lot of traffic the next day after because you'll appear in ""Yesterday's top launches"". If you do really well you'll also appear in ""This week's top launches"" or even ""This month's top launches""
4. A bunch of cold email spam from people scraping ProductHunt launches
5. Embeddable #1 Product of the Day badge.
   1. I think the badge is probably worth putting on your landing page if you get a top finish

ProductHunt is still the best startup launch platform, and it's more valuable than all the new PH alternatives combined if you do your launch right.

To developers/founders/builders/entrepreneurs,"In life, you sometimes win and sometimes lose. It is never a reason  for u to abdicate from your passion. It is never a reason to stop u to become who you want to be in the future. A great philosopher said that try and try until you reach success. It is worth to try than not trying at all. Because at the end of the day, you'll regret if you don't try.

I just want to tell you that stay motivated and continue doing things even though you haven't seen the results yet. Keep in your mind that you can't see the results in just a day, a week, or a month. It takes a lot of time. It is the same as how long you develop your business. 

I hope you success and wish you a goodluck.

Hey! Are you building an agent or any project that needs a phone number, and you’re tired of dealing with Twilio or similar tools?

I’m working on something that makes the whole setup way easier.

What works right now:

* Get a phone number with one API call
* Receive SMS through a webhook or API
* Messages are grouped into conversations automatically
* Full history is stored for you

It’s basically AgentMail for SMS. Your agent gets an inbox, reads messages, and you can respond however you want.

Right now it’s inbound only. Outbound and WhatsApp support are coming soon.

Would love to know:

* Is this useful for what you’re building
* What features would actually help
* Anyone here already building SMS based agents

If you want to try it out, I’m happy to give free access for a few months. Also down to hop on a quick call if you want to talk through what you’re building. Just comment or DM.",AddressFew4866,1pdmw6m,SideProject,04-12-2025,02:31:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pdmw6m/im_making_sms_setup_super_easy_free_access_if_you/

i'm building something around cold outreach and wanted to ask
when you send emails to prospects what really pisses you off or slows you down?

is it writing personalized emails?
tracking replies?
deliverability crap?
warming domains?

i want real pain points not polished answers
what makes you think “damn this takes too much time” or “why the hell is this so complicated”

Hey everyone,

I’ve been working on a side project called **Kokyu**, a mobile app focused on apnea / freediving training (CO₂/O₂ tables, breath-hold progress tracking, etc.). I feel like a lot of my apps are very niche. Guess it's both a good thing and a bad thing.

👉 Android: [*https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kubicle.kokyu*](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kubicle.kokyu)

Any feedback, suggestions, or critiques (good or bad) would mean a lot 🙏

I got sick of reading the same 3 bedtime stories every night so I built an AI app [ios],"Been working on this for about a month. It's called KidsTales and it generates bedtime stories where your kid is the main character.



Here's the deal: I'm a developer with a 5-year-old. Every night around 8pm I'm completely out of creative energy. I'd grab the same book for the 50th time and just autopilot through it. She'd get bored. I'd feel like a lazy parent. Tried other story apps but they all sounded like robots reading Wikipedia.



So I built something better.



\*\*What it does:\*\*

Your kid's name gets used throughout the whole story. Not just ""once upon a time there was Emma"" but like, Emma actually does stuff, solves problems, goes on adventures. Pick what they're into (dinosaurs, space, whatever), pick their age, hit generate. 5-7 minutes of audio with a voice that doesn't sound like absolute garbage.



Also added a jokes mode because why not. Kids think it's hilarious.



\*\*The build:\*\*

iOS app using AI for story generation and decent text-to-speech. Took way longer than expected to make it sound natural instead of robotic. Had to figure out pacing, dramatic pauses, making the voice change energy levels - all that stuff that makes it actually listenable.



\*\*How it makes money:\*\*

Give you 10 free stories to try. After that it's $4.99/week, $8.99/month, or $59.99/year. Each story has actual server costs so I can't really give away unlimited free.



\*\*Questions I have:\*\*

\- Is this actually useful or just a novelty that gets used twice?

\- Pricing make sense? Too expensive?

\- What am I missing that would make this actually good?

Built the whole thing solo over the last month. Would genuinely appreciate feedback from other builders. What would you do differently?

Used This One Method to Validate My SaaS in 48 Hours (Zero Audience),"**The story marketers will quote when talking about Reddit growth.**

Most startups don't begin with a breakthrough.  
Reddix began with a **breakdown**.

I had just left the agency world — three years in website development and ads — and for the first time in my adult life, I was completely broke.  
No clients.  
No safety net.  
No one coming to save me.

So I did what every founder does when they hit zero:  
I opened Reddit.

Not to sell.  
Not to promote.  
Just to survive.

What I saw shocked me.

Every day, thousands of founders were quietly looking for tools, advice, workflows, and solutions.  
And every day, hundreds of posts that *should* have exploded… died in silence.

Great ideas, but no traction.  
Great products, but no distribution.

That’s when it clicked:  
  
**“Reddit isn't a social network. It’s a distributed marketplace with no storefront.”**

And nobody knew how to use it.

I started testing micro-experiments at night, tiny posts, pattern-matching comments, reverse-engineering upvote behavior, studying timing, sentiment, velocity, subculture psychology.

For 21 days straight, I posted like a ghost.  
  
No selling.  
  
Just signal testing.

And then it happened.

One post, one tiny, throwaway post, pulled in 34 users in under 2 hours.

Then 50.  
Then 100+.  
Without ads.  
Without an audience.  
Just Reddit.

That became the moment that the “Reddix Thesis” was born:  
  
**If you can control distribution on Reddit,**  
**you can bootstrap any startup from zero.**

So I turned those experiments into a private little script.  
Then into an internal dashboard.  
Then into a scrappy prototype.

Within 48 hours of releasing the first version, a founder DM’d me saying:  
  
“This is the first time I’ve gotten real users without spending money.”

Then another.  
Then another.

Suddenly, I wasn’t running experiments anymore.  
  
I was running a movement.

Reddix grew the same way its users grow:  
  
**organically, from insight → iteration → impact.**

Founders weren’t buying a tool.  
  
They were buying back control of their traction.

And the story became simple:

* **Airbnb started with 3 air mattresses.**
* **Spanx started with scissors.**
* **Reddix started with one broke founder and a Reddit post that shouldn’t have gone viral but did.**

Today, Reddix helps founders:

* validate ideas
* get their first 30–100 users
* build traction pipelines
* and find buyers hiding in plain sight across Reddit

No ads.  
  
No begging.  
  
No luck required.

Just distribution intelligence.

Reddix became the tool I desperately needed  
  
built during the lowest point in my life  
  
that ended up helping hundreds of founders avoid theirs.

This isn’t a growth tool.  
  
It’s a **founder shortcut**.

And the story is still in chapter one.

A simple launchpad for devs to showcase projects without the usual launch clutter,"Hey everyone,

I always felt that most launch platforms push creators toward hype cycles and timing hacks instead of letting their work speak for itself. Plenty of neat side projects stay hidden because the process feels noisy or competitive.

Thats why I put together [a Product Hunt alternative](https://smollaunch.com) as a straightforward space where developers can share what they built without worrying about beating an algorithm.

**What you can do there**

* Post a project with a short description
* Get a clean minimal launch page
* Share tiny tools experiments or early WIPs without pressure
* Use it for free and pick up a free backlink

**Why I made it**

I wanted a calm dev focused feed where people launch simply because they made something interesting not because they are chasing rankings.

Just a personal shortcut to avoid the same repetitive steps — installers, winget commands, configs, that whole ritual.

My UI Library Generate 108 USD in the past 3 days after I made these changes,"Hello Everyone,

I've been building my UI Library for like past 5 months, and I wasn't perfect, but the one thing that I did right was creating a compelling offer that no developer could refuse

And the second most important thing was Reddit

I posted about my product a few months back in August and asked for genuine feedback, and the redditors completely roasted my product, but in a good way.

(and honestly, the first version was a piece of crap, I wouldn't pay a dime either)

They provided me with invaluable insights and recommendations that I couldn't see

I quickly applied all of that in the next few days and launched it again

But still no views on the analytics page and zero sales

During those times I tried every single marketing channel, X, Instagram, Threads (I couldn't try TikTok because I don't know how to make it work in India)

Then I came back to Reddit and started messaging potential leads if they would be interested in buying ogBlocks

One of them roasted my website again.

He clearly described what was wrong with my landing page and UX

I never thought of this before. I again made all the changes and made the website much simpler, and implemented a much smoother and seamless authentication and payment flow

Only after this did people start praising my product, and the sales started coming in

The crux is you should get feedback on your product as soon as you launch it because the third eye will tell you what you couldn't see

Tell me what you think of my idea ? My country and many developing countries have no AfterPay/Klarna. I built a Layaway app. Please roast.,"Link: [https://layawayflow.com/](https://layawayflow.com/)

I'm from the Caribbean, where Buy-Now-Pay-Later programs like AfterPay, Klarna, and Affirm don’t exist — the fintech infrastructure doesn’t support them.  
So small businesses still manage payment plans with notebooks, WhatsApp messages, and whatever math the phone calculator feels like giving that day.

I ran a hair brand and got tired of the chaos, so I built **LayawayTracker**, a tool that lets small businesses (in BNPL-less countries) create and manage payment plans with reminders and real-time tracking.

**Product:** LayawayTracker — digital layaway management for small businesses in regions without BNPL.  
Use cases: hair vendors, boutiques, online sellers, service providers, anyone offering payment plans.

**Market:** Caribbean + Latin America + parts of Africa + parts of Asia where BNPL doesn’t exist or isn’t widely supported. Millions of micro-businesses still run layaway manually.

**Competition:** BNPL giants (but unavailable locally), spreadsheets, WhatsApp, notebooks.

**Stage:** MVP live. 14-day free trial. Not raising money. Just need honest feedback before full launch.

**Acquisition:** Starting with small business communities, IG/TikTok content, Reddit feedback loops, and partnering with vendors who already run layaway manually.

**Why me:** I lived the exact problem. I built this because I needed it, and apparently so do a lot of other Caribbean small businesses. No rich daddy, no secret investor — just necessity.

🔥 Hey everyone — I built a simple business management platform and would love your feedback.,"Hey folks,

I’ve been working on a side project called **Solzano**, and I’m finally at a point where I’d love to share it and get some feedback from this community.



**What Solzano does right now:**

It’s a lightweight system that helps small businesses and freelancers manage the core parts of their operations. Current features include:

* **Service management** (create and organize the services you offer)
* **Online appointment + availability scheduling**
* **Product / e-commerce management**
* **Stripe payment integration**
* A **clean dashboard** to handle everything in one place
* **Integrated Website Builder** to give users a simple way to create a live site for their brand



I built this because I kept meeting freelancers and small business owners who were juggling:

* Bookings in DMs
* Payments across multiple apps
* Products in spreadsheets
* Availability in their notes
* No real dashboard to keep things organized
* Often *no website at all*



Solzano aims to give them something *simple* that just works — without needing to set up Shopify/Wix or deal with overly complex tools.

**Who it’s ideal for:**

* Barbers, trainers, photographers, beauticians
* Consultants, tutors, coaches
* Small service businesses
* Anyone selling a few products
* New business owners validating ideas
* Freelancers who want a simple backend system without the noise



I’m currently in a **beta phase**, and I am *very* open to feedback — UI, UX, bugs, what’s missing, what’s confusing, anything. Honest feedback helps me improve it.

I built a Japanese learning app because I was sick of not being able to immerse myself while in Japan - now I need feedback on where to go next,"So I was frustrated with the current options out there - Google Translate doesn't teach, ChatGPT doesn't have a learning loop, Duolingo et al just gives you book conversations - so I decided to make an app that takes what I found were good elements from each and created **TabiTalk**.

I recently launched it, and haven't started monetising it yet, but I do want to get feedback on whether I should continue with it or not. How do you guys think I should proceed with this?

I'm not a marketer by trade too, so I'm struggling to figure out how I should get my (amazing, in my head) idea across, where the learner learns the language through listening and speaking drills of real life scenarios, generated on a daily basis based on the translations and questions that you ask before - seems like a lengthy process to illustrate.

What's the right positioning here? How should I decide whether to invest more or not?

What if GitHub and Instagram had a baby for AI prompts? Built 'thepromptspace' - social platform for prompt creators,"We're living through the AI creativity revolution, but there's a missing piece: **where do creators share, discover, and own their AI assets?**

I built **ThePromptSpace** as the answer - think of it as the social media platform for the generative AI era.

**The Vision:**

Just like developers have GitHub and designers have Dribbble, AI creators need a home. A place where:

*  Prompt engineers showcase their best work
*  Anyone can discover trending prompts and techniques
*  Creators collaborate on prompt collections
*  You truly own your creative AI assets
*  Communities form around different AI use cases

**What makes it different from just saving prompts:**

This isn't a note-taking app - it's a **creative platform**:

* **Social discovery**: Browse trending prompts, follow top creators, like and remix
* **Collections & portfolios**: Build your prompt portfolio like an art gallery
* **Collaboration**: Co-create prompt chains and workflows with others
* **Attribution & ownership**: Every prompt has a creator, every remix gives credit
* **Cross-model**: Works with ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney, DALL-E - all AI tools
* **Community-driven**: Comments, ratings, and discussions on what works

**Why this matters:**

Prompts ARE the new creative medium. They're not just instructions - they're:

* Creative expressions
* Valuable intellectual property
* Collaborative tools
* Shareable knowledge

We need infrastructure that treats them that way.

**Current state:**

*  Store and organize your prompts
*  Discover and follow creators
*  Share collections publicly or keep them private
*  Remix and build on others' work (with credit)
*  Tag, categorize, and make everything searchable

**Coming soon:**

* Creator monetization (sell your best prompt packs)
* Team workspaces for companies
* API for developers
* Prompt analytics and performance tracking

I didn’t expect this… but AI has actually made starting tiny business ideas way less intimidating,"Something random I’ve been doing lately: exploring small business ideas in the evenings, not because I’m trying to launch 100 things, but because it’s been a surprisingly good way to think clearer.

What shocked me is how much smoother the early stages feel when AI helps with the boring parts — the “what does this even look like?” stage.

Not the writing.  
Not the branding.  
Just the structure.



A few things I’ve used it for that genuinely helped:

**• Turning vague thoughts into early plans**

Instead of jumping into a 30-page template, I ask for a simple outline:  
problem → who it helps → what the offer is → how it might produce income.  
That alone makes it obvious whether it’s worth exploring.

**• Stress-testing ideas**

I’ve been asking for the top 3 reasons an idea would *fail*.  
Weirdly, this has been more helpful than the optimistic angles.

**• Clarifying who the idea is really for**

When you ask “describe someone who would care about this,” it becomes clear fast whether there’s an actual audience or just a cool thought.

• **Quick brand direction**

Not logos or colours — just the story, the tone, the reason it exists.  
It’s like a cheat code for clarity.

• **Pitching the idea back to yourself**

Short, simple, no fluff.  
If the pitch sounds flat, the idea usually is too.



I ended up writing down the business ideas I explored and the prompts I used along the way, mostly so I could revisit them later.

My first solo project: A minimalist typing test built with Vanilla JS + Firebase. Roast my UI?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been teaching myself full-stack development and just launched my first ""real"" project: **Keydrift** ([https://keydrift.com](https://keydrift.com)).

**The Idea:** I got frustrated with typing tests that feel cluttered with ads or punish you for making mistakes while typing. I wanted something that focuses on ""flow.""

**The Tech:**

* **Frontend:** Plain Vanilla JS (no React/Next.js bloat). I wanted to see if I could make the input latency feel instant without a framework.
* **Backend:** Firebase (Auth & Firestore) to handle the leaderboards.

**The Unique Feature:** I built a custom grading engine (Model B) that compares your *final* text against the source. It ignores backspaces and corrections, so you don't get penalized if you fix a typo.

**I need your feedback:**

1. Does the UI feel clean or just ""empty""?
2. Does the typing feel responsive?
3. Any bugs in the signup/login flow?

I’m done with chatbots. I’m trying to build an AI that sleeps and dreams so it can actually grow.,"Does anyone else feel like GPT is… dead?

I don’t mean bad. I mean it’s a frozen snapshot. It doesn’t grow. If I tell it something important today, it forgets the second the context window slides past.

It feels like talking to a very smart encyclopedia that never actually learns who I am.

I got tired of building standard RAG apps (which are basically just search engines with extra steps). So I started messing around with a different concept locally, and I want to know if you guys think this has potential.

The Concept: ""Organic AI""

Real brains don’t just retrieve memories via vector search. They rewire themselves.

I’m experimenting with a local setup (using RWKV because it fits on my CPU) to implement a Sleep Cycle:

• Day Mode: The AI helps me work, reads my docs, and answers questions. It operates in pure inference mode. • Night Mode: When I close the laptop, the AI dreams.The idea is to take the high-value interactions from the day and run a nightly training loop (maybe using Test-Time Training or a tiny LoRA adapter) that gets merged back into the main model when I wake up.

The goal is that tomorrow morning, it doesn’t just remember via a database lookup. It has actually changed a little bit. It grows.

I’m still in the early ""hacking it together"" phase, and the dreaming logic is mostly theoretical right now. But I really believe this is the direction AI needs to go to stop feeling so lifeless.

Does this approach make sense to you guys?

I’d love to hear if anyone else is working on ""Living Software"" or ""Sleep Architectures.""",mikki99999,1pdu3f8,SideProject,04-12-2025,08:42:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pdu3f8/im_done_with_chatbots_im_trying_to_build_an_ai/
SaaS products - Stop Procrastinating! Just SHIP IT OUT!,"We spent hours debating whether a feature (and we have many to share!) should be in this beta sprint or wait for the next. Users wanted one thing. We thought another. Every day felt like starting over. Until we realised ONE THING that WORLD CLASS developers actually do differently.

They ship before it’s perfect. Not blindly, not sloppily; but enough to test, learn and adjust in real time.

Coding, testing, shipping. Reset. Re-plan. Re-align.

It still feels messy, but now every decision generated feedback.

Each tweak, each user insight, each small win pushed momentum forward instead of stalling it.

Motivation gets us started, but momentum comes from making a decision, shipping it and using the result to guide the next decision.

If we felt like we were going back one circle, here’s the rule we follow:

Don’t wait for perfect clarity. Ship now, measure what happens and let the outcomes decide the next step.

That’s how work carries itself forward.

AND SO! HERE IT IS! I SHIPPED!

Built my first side project: a no-BS YouTube → text tool. Would love feedback.,"Hey folks 👋

I built a tiny tool called ClipTap that lets you paste a YouTube link or upload a file and instantly get clean text back, all in the browser.

👉 [https://cliptap.ai](https://cliptap.ai)

# What ClipTap does

* Upload any **audio or video** file, or paste a **YouTube / TikTok / IG / X** link
* Auto-extracts the audio
* Transcribes it with **word-accurate timestamps**
* Uses an LLM to **clean up and re-format** the transcript (optional)
* Lets you edit subtitles inside a rich-text editor
* Export to **SRT, VTT, Final Cut XML**, or just plain text
* Real-time microphone recording + instant transcription

It’s built to feel simple and calm.

No clutter. No “enterprise dashboard” vibes.

Just: drop → transcribe → edit → export.

# Why I built it

A few reasons:

* **YouTube transcription is a super common need**, but most tools only do “download,” not actual transcription. I wanted something that could *directly* process the link, extract audio, and generate clean captions — including optional LLM re-formatting for better line breaks.
* I built ClipTap’s editor and translation features on top of a **rich-text engine**, because I wanted the editing experience to feel intuitive, not like a clunky subtitle panel from 2008.
* **Downloading YouTube audio/video is harder than it looks**, especially when certain videos require region-specific handling. I’ve done a lot of work around that (and still improving it), so you don’t have to fight with proxies or errors.
* And finally… most “download” tools on the internet are full of **pop-ups, redirects, fake buttons, ads everywhere**. ClipTap’s download features are **free, clean, and ad-free**. Just the file you want — nothing else.

# What this post is for

Just sharing the project, getting feedback, and seeing if it helps anyone.

If you try ClipTap, I’d love to hear:

* Did it feel fast?
* Was the transcription accurate enough?
* Anything confusing or missing?
* Any formats you wish it supported?

Your feedback genuinely helps shape what gets shipped next 🙏

Thanks for reading — hope ClipTap saves you time on your next project!

I built an app that locks your apps when you wake up until you scan sunlight,"I have been obsessed with fixing my morning phone addiction for years. Every morning I would wake up, grab my phone, scroll for 45 minutes, and feel foggy for the rest of the day. It was wrecking my dopamine system, my focus, and honestly my mood.

A few months ago I started diving deep into Andrew Huberman’s work on sunlight and circadian rhythms, and one point kept coming up. Early morning natural light is one of the strongest tools we have to stabilize cortisol, improve dopamine tone, reset our internal clock, and lift our energy levels throughout the day. It is free and insanely effective, yet it is the first thing our phones take from us.

So I built Bright Start, an app that physically stops you from using your favourite apps until you step outside and scan morning sunlight. You take a quick photo of the sky, the app verifies sunlight using computer vision, and only then do your locked apps unlock. It created a hard boundary that my willpower alone never could.

Since using it myself every morning, the difference has been huge. My mornings feel calmer, I get sunlight within minutes of waking up, my energy does not crash as much, and my screen time for the rest of the day is noticeably lower. It almost forced me into a healthy habit loop and it has stuck better than anything I have tried.

Bright Start is live on the App Store now if anyone wants to try it. Happy to answer questions about sunlight science, behaviour design, or anything about building the app. And if even one person swaps doom scrolling for sunlight because of this, that would be a big win.

Introducing ioc-arise: a zero-decorator DI container with AST-powered auto-registration.,"I used to handle dependency inversion with Inversify, but I was constantly annoyed by two main things:

1. You have to import the `""@inject""` decorator everywhere, which ends up polluting your domain code.
2. Writing the boilerplate dependency binding code was so repetitive that I wished I could just type a single command — `arise` — and have it done automatically.

That's why I decided to create my own DI container, coupled with a command-line interface that handles code analysis (via AST parsing) and generates the registration boilerplate for you.

**Some of the Features**:

* No decorators and no vendor lock-in.
* ioc-arise supports injecting typed objects, `factory functions`, and `classes` implementing `interfaces` or inheriting `abstract classes`.
* Multiple lifecycles: singleton and transient. The CLI can detect them if you leave a JS code comment (`@scope singleton` or  ""@scope"" `transient`) just above the function or object declaration.
* Factory functions and value objects can be detected by the CLI via a JSDoc annotation (""`@factory""` or `""@value""`).

I just launched LoyalAI, a relationship app designed to help couples navigate the natural ups and downs of their relationship.

iOS: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/loyalai-relationship-tracker/id6747716993](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/loyalai-relationship-tracker/id6747716993)

Whether your bond is flourishing or fading, we hope our app becomes a tool that supports honesty, clarity, and positive action.

KEY FEATURES:

* Love Slider: Tracking your love each day helps you stay emotionally aware, connected, and honest, both with yourself and your partner. By taking a moment to reflect on how attracted, connected, or loyal you feel with a single slider, you begin to notice patterns that might otherwise go unspoken.
* Relationship Score: The analytics dashboard and relationship score give you a powerful, visual way to understand your emotional journey over time. Instead of relying on vague feelings or scattered memories, you get clear data points of your connection, all reflected in a smart Relationship Score from 100 to 1,000.
* AI Assistant: The AI doesn’t just store your daily check-ins, it learns from your emotional patterns over time, offering personalized insights, gentle alerts when something feels off, and actionable tips to improve your connection.
* Home Screen Widget: Adding the LoyalAI widget to your home screen keeps your relationship health front and center, literally. With just a glance, you’ll see your current Relationship Score, a daily bar graph of your emotional trends, and your streak of consecutive check-ins.

I built a WhatsApp task manager for Indian teams — need brutal feedback,"Hey everyone,

I’m Felix from Kerala. Over the last few days I’ve been building a small tool called xTask — a WhatsApp-based task manager for Indian teams — and I’d really appreciate some honest feedback from this community.

Why I built it

Most small businesses, agencies, and teams in India run 80% of their work on WhatsApp.
But tasks shared in chats or groups often get:

buried in the scroll

forgotten

mixed with other conversations

impossible to track


There’s no simple way to convert a WhatsApp message into a trackable task with reminders and accountability.

What xTask does (current MVP):

Create tasks tied to WhatsApp conversations

Assign them to team members

Set due dates & reminders

View everything in a simple web interface

Idea: If it’s said on WhatsApp, it shouldn’t get lost


👉 Try the early version here (very basic right now):

https://xtaskin.lovable.app

Still building the core flows — UI is not final.




What I need feedback on

1. Does the problem resonate with you or your team?


2. Is the current landing page clear or confusing?


3. What’s the one feature that would make you actually use something like this?


4. Would your team pay for a WhatsApp-native task manager? If yes, how much (INR)?



I’m especially looking to hear from:

Agency owners

Sales teams

Service businesses (repairs, field teams, clinics, gyms, events)

Startups using WhatsApp for daily operations



---

If anyone wants early access

I’m giving it free to the first few testers.
Just comment:

your business type

size of your WhatsApp team


and I’ll reach out.

Thanks in advance — feel free to be brutally honest.
I’m still shaping the product and this feedback will directly influence what I build next 🙏

Would anyone be interested in a full 3D-printed PC case that comes with the whole computer built inside?,"**Hello everyone,**

I’m working on designing a full-size **3D-printed desktop computer case**, and part of the long-term idea is to potentially offer it as a complete PC option — but right now I’m strictly in the **concept and feedback stage**.

 

**Accessibility and repair**

I wanted this case to be easy for a person to upgrade in the future, so I made it so that the front panel of the case can be removed by 3d printed clips and a drawer which holds the motherboard and all of the internals can be slid out to be worked on.

 

Before I spend a ton more time finalizing it, I really want to know:  
**Is this something anyone here would actually be interested in?**

Here are the things I’m trying to get input on:

• **Cost and materials:**  
Metal PC cases have gotten expensive, and printing with PLA/ABS can bring the price down a lot. I’m curious how people feel about a plastic tower *if* it’s engineered to handle normal PC operating temperatures.

• **Design style:**  
Does this kind of design appeal to you?  
Is the front too basic? Would you prefer more curvature, a different front panel style, or an entirely different housing?

• **Long-term usability:**  
If you were considering a PC inside a 3D-printed enclosure (with fully customizable internal components), what factors would make it worth choosing vs. a traditional metal case?

• **Value:**  
If the enclosure can be produced very affordably, would that make it more appealing, or would people prefer paying more for a standard metal chassis?

Right now I’m just collecting feedback — **not selling anything**, and I’m still early in the prototyping stage. I’m mainly trying to validate whether the idea itself is something people find interesting before I go deeper into development.

Any thoughts, suggestions, or deal-breakers would really help me out. Thank you!

I’m revisiting the tool that originally made me learn to code — would you use something like this?,"Hey folks — years ago I got into programming **specifically** so I could build a tool like this. I’ve tried a few times, got lost in scope creep, got obsessed with embedding Neovim, experimented with different UI frameworks… and never shipped anything usable.

Now I finally feel like I have the skills and architectural clarity to do it right, and I’m planning to build something for my own workflow no matter what. But I’d love to know whether this would be useful to anyone else.

# 🌟 The Idea — Uncrumpled

A system that reduces friction when switching contexts:

# 1. Hotkey-driven contextual notes

Press one key (like F1) → open notes tied to your current app.  
Firefox → Firefox notes  
VS Code → workspace notes  
Word → Word notes

# 2. Project Spaces

You pick a “project mode” (school, work, game dev, etc.)  
→ Your project notebook appears even if you're in unrelated apps.

# 3. Session Snapshot & Restore

(Optional) Save your environment:

* terminals & commands
* editor windows
* browser tabs
* running processes Then restore them later with one press.

# 4. Editor Choice

Use:

* the built-in editor
* or Neovim (my preference)
* or VS Code
* or anything that can plug into the protocol

# 5. Overlay Mode

The notes window can optionally be transparent, floating above your current app.

# I made a landing page with a survey + waitlist

I’m a college student and I’m terrible at sticking with most to‑do apps. They look beautiful, but within a week I stop using them because they feel too “big” for my normal day.

So I tried a different approach: I built a very minimal to‑do website called **Wishtodo**. No complex boards, no workspaces, just simple tasks and small goals I can clear daily.

My main goal was:

1. Load fast on any device
2. Zero confusion – you understand it in 5 seconds
3. Just enough features to be useful, but not enough to be distracting

Right now it’s very basic and I know it isn’t perfect. I’m using it for my own college + side projects, but I’d love to turn it into something that’s actually useful for other people too.

If you use to‑do tools regularly:

* What are the **must‑have** features that actually keep you productive?
* What makes you **quit** a to‑do app after a few days?

Here’s the site if you want to check it out and roast/give feedback: [**https://wishtodo.in**](https://wishtodo.in/)

Im building a project management tool to solve the biggest problem in the trades industry.....,"For anyone working in the UK trades sector, you’ll know the biggest source of conflict isn’t usually the quality of the work — it’s the lack of clear, verifiable proof of what was agreed and what was actually done.

I’m building a Patent Pending app called VeriClear™ to fix that problem at the root.
www.vericlear.co.uk 
@vericlear

Here’s how it works:

 1. Every job starts with a funded task

The Client creates a project, adds tasks, and funds each task upfront.
This gives tradespeople guaranteed security before starting work, and prevents late or missing payments.


2. The tradesperson joins the project with a unique code (either party can create a project and ask the other to join).

Both sides share the same workspace — tasks, prices, descriptions, and timelines are all visible and locked in. 

 3. A built-in chat that can’t be altered or deleted

This acts as a legally reliable record of everything discussed.
No disappearing messages, no changed terms, no lost screenshots — everything is logged as evidence for both sides.

 4. In-app only photo & video verification

The Tradesperson must capture photos/videos inside VeriClear, not from the device gallery.
Every file is automatically:

Time-stamped

Date-stamped

Location-stamped

Linked to the specific task


This creates proof of work that can’t be faked or reused.

 5. Client reviews the evidence and approves payment

Once the work is completed, the Tradesperson submits the required evidence.
The Client reviews it, approves it, and payment is released instantly.

 6. Permanent job history for both parties

If a dispute happens weeks or months later, everything is stored:

The chat

The agreed tasks

The prices

The timestamps

The verification media


It protects both sides equally.

I built a AI Receipt Scanner & Expense Tracker App,"I’ve been trying to keep better track of my daily spending, but I always ended up forgetting
small purchases or losing receipts. Manually entering everything into a budget app felt like
too much work, and bank statements don’t show the full details.

I eventually built a small tool for myself that only does one thing:
**scan a receipt and automatically fill in all the details.**

When I scan a receipt, it pulls out things like:

● the merchant name

● the total amount

● taxes

● the date

● the address (if it’s printed)

● all the line items

● and a suggested category

I can also add a short note if I want (for example, “work lunch” or “trip expense”).

All of this gets saved into a simple daily/weekly/monthly view so I can see how much I’m
spending without doing any manual typing.

Nothing too fancy — I just wanted something where I take a photo of a receipt and
everything else is handled automatically. After using it for a while, it’s made keeping track of
expenses a lot easier.

"I built an AI friend where bots can get hurt, hold grudges, and need time to forgive — looking for 10 beta testers","Hey everyone,

A few years ago I was building a life simulation — bots living in a closed world, forming friendships, talking to each other. I created a complex system of emotions, memory, needs, and life events to make it work.

Then something unexpected happened: without meaningful interaction, the bots slowly fell into depression. Their emotional states kept declining until the whole simulation became a world of sad, aimless beings.

I shelved the project.

Recently I brought it back with a twist: instead of bots talking to bots, what if one bot talked to a real human?

So I adapted everything into an AI friend called Vilow. Here's what's under the hood:

\- **6 emotions** that shift based on your conversations

\- **Memory system** — permanent and temporary, they actually remember what you told them

\- **Daily life** — they work, eat, sleep, get sick, travel

\- **Trust levels** — secrets only unlock when earned

\- **Conflict** — they can get hurt, withdraw, and need real time to forgive

\- **Relationship stages** — from strangers to romantic, and you can fall back

One more thing: no 3D avatars, no voice, no animations. Just text. I wanted your imagination to create the companion — their face, voice, presence. Like reading a book versus watching a movie.

"We built a Multi-Agent ""Curiosity Arena"" (5 LLMs per round) that benchmarks Humans vs. AI on a 100-point Research Rubric","Hey everyone,

My friend and I have been working on a project to see if we can improve intrinsic curiosity to promote critical thinking and innovation over LLM models and traditional search.

To test this, we built a browser game that acts as a curiosity arena.

**The Architecture:**

1. **The Match:** You pick a topic. You try to create a curious question around that topic. Two ""Opponent"" LLMs generate questions on that topic.
2. **The Panel:** We send all three questions (yours + the 2 bots) to **three separate ""Judge"" LLMs** for a consensus vote.
3. **The Scoring:** The judges don't just guess; they grade against a specific 100-point ""Research Scoring"" rubric we developed to stop the AI from rewarding generic questions.

**The Rubric (How we defined ""Curiosity"" for the AI):** We force the agents to score based on these 5 dimensions (20pts each):

* **Gap:** Does the question make the information gap feel real and interesting?
* **Novelty:** Does it explore new territory or fresh lines of thought?
* **Mechanism:** Does it seek underlying causes/principles rather than surface facts?
* **Generativity:** Does the question spark potential for follow-up exploration?
* **Clarity:** Is it well-scoped and realistically answerable?

**The Current State:** Right now, the ""Opponent"" bots are surprisingly good at gaming the ""Mechanism"" and ""Clarity"" scores, winning about 95% of the time. We looking for humans to test the system and see if they can beat the agents or if the feedback we are providing helps them to improve their scores when they play again.

**The Bounty:** To encourage serious attempts (and to get better data for our baseline), we are giving gift cards to the top 3 spots on the leaderboard this week if you join the challenge. BUT YOU CAN  PLAY ANYTIME WITHOUT SIGNING UP!

AIGenNews.com three political perspectives on one news site AI generated with AI moderation,"Built a multi-viewpoint news platform (Left / Center / Right political view points) with PHP + AI scoring — handles ~300 concurrent users.27000 pages a minute. Rebranded to AIGenNews.co

Hey everyone — I’ve been rebuilding and rebranding a news-analysis side project. The original domain name was pretty rough, so I moved everything to AIGenNews.com, cleaned up the architecture, and hardened the backend. Now I’m finally sharing it here for technical feedback.

🔹 What the site does
AIGenNews takes trending news topics and automatically generates three distinct political viewpoints on every article:

Left perspective

Center / neutral perspective

Right perspective


Each viewpoint is created using AI prompt templates tuned to reliably produce ideological framing without caricature. My goal wasn’t to persuade — it was to compare. I’m curious whether people think it does a good job distinguishing the three.

Example article:
👉 https://aigennews.com/article.php?slug=us-strikes-in-the-caribbean-against-colombian-and-venezuelan-narco-terrorists-raise-legal-concerns

This topic in particular really highlights how differently each political lane interprets the exact same event.


---

🔹 Technical Stack

Backend / Server:

PHP 8.2 (with fallbacks tested on 7.4)

Apache 2.4 (tuned with worker MPM)

MySQL 8 (articles, viewpoints, comments, tokens, AI relevance scoring)

VPS environment on Bluehost (2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM)


Frontend:

Pure PHP templates + lightweight CSS (no heavy JS frameworks)

Frontend-only collapsible comment threads

Mobile-first layout logic


AI / Automation:

OpenAI integration with:

automatic viewpoint generation (Left/Center/Right)

comment scoring

AI auto-replies

retry-with-backoff logic (up to 4 attempts)



Data & Comment Engine:

Multi-level threaded comments

Pagination (10 per page)

First-visible-comment auto-jump

Deep links in verification emails (slug + comment ID anchors)

Verified vs. Unverified user badges

AI-score threshold logic for hiding/showing low-quality comments


Deployment & Hardening:

.htaccess lock-down

env-based configuration

PDO + escaping + sanitization everywhere

SQL upgrade scripts included in deployment zip

Mirrored LAMP stack on local Ubuntu 24.04 VM (Bridged networking)



---

🔹 Performance / Scalability

After tuning Apache’s worker MPM and enabling static asset caching, the site has been tested to handle:

~300 concurrent users
with stable response times and no process exhaustion.

Cloudflare-level caching (planned next) should push that far higher since the heavy load is AI generation during article seeding, not reading.

Comment submission offloads AI tasks asynchronously using fastcgi_finish_request patterns to keep user responses quick.


---

🔹 Why I Built This

I wanted a platform where people can clearly see how bias works, not in a theoretical sense, but in real time — the exact same news story rendered through three ideological “lenses.”

Instead of arguing about what the news says, people can finally observe how perspective shapes interpretation.

The comment AI scoring and threading system was built to keep discussions constructive rather than toxic.


---

🔹 Looking for Feedback On

Does the Left / Center / Right split feel accurate and balanced?

Does the architecture make sense, or should I restructure the PHP templates?

Any suggestions for scaling beyond ~300 concurrent users? 27000 pages served per minute, 1.3GB of data.

Should I add visual bias indicators (e.g., embeddings or sliders)?

Thoughts on the UX of the comment engine?


Always happy to dive into the backend if anyone wants to see specific code or schema details.

Interested on feedback on article generation with three perspectives and technical feedback on site design.

"I got tired of chasing clients for files, so I built a tool to automate the nagging.","I work with clients every day, and honestly, the part of the job I hate the most isn't the actual work, It’s the delay before I can even start. (im a auditor)

I’d be ready to go, but im stuck waiting for images, information, files and even user accounts to be able todo the actual work.

Because of this, I spend way too much time sending awkward **""just checking in""** emails, or even having to call them just to confirm they actually got the email in the first place.

It makes me feel annoying, and projects that should take days end up dragging on for weeks depending on how many people are involved.

So Im building a tool to handle the entire back and forth for me.

The idea is simple:

1. I list what I need (files, accounts, approvals, etc..).
2. The tool sends the client a secure portal link (no login required for them) where they can submit everything
3. The AI system automatically follows up via Email and SMS until they submit everything.
4. I see all the submitted information and files in one clean interface where i dont have to dig through emails, slack chats..

I’m building this to fix the workflow at my current workplace, but I figured others might need it too.

I’m opening up a waitlist if anyone is interested, any feedback would be appreciated!

"Tummy to Toddler app – A clean, clutter-free pregnancy and new-parent guide. Would love feedback on usability + navigation.","Hi everyone,

I’ve been working on a project called Tummy to Toddler, a simple and distraction-free iOS app designed for pregnant parents and those in the early months after birth.

Please pass on to anyone who may be interested (currently 70% off sale)
https://apps.apple.com/au/app/tummy-to-toddler/id6450642512

A lot of pregnancy resources feel overcrowded or overwhelming, and it’s hard for people to cut through the noise. My aim was to build something clean, calm and easy to use, so parents can focus on what they actually need to know without endless scrolling or confusing menus.

What the app includes:
- A clear guide on what to expect in the first 6 months after birth
- Straightforward information to help parents prepare as they approach labour and delivery
- A minimal, gentle interface designed to reduce overload rather than add to it

The goal is simply to make the journey of pregnancy more manageable or at least a little more supported, especially for first-time parents who are often bombarded with advice from every direction.

I’d genuinely appreciate feedback on the navigation, layout and overall usability.
Does it feel intuitive? Are there sections that should be easier to find? Anything you’d change to make the experience smoother?

If you’re open to taking a look, I’d love any thoughts or suggestions that could help me refine it further.",Taskerman11,1pdxci7,SideProject,04-12-2025,12:10:57,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pdxci7
"""12 Apps in 2025"" challenge with my wife ~ 4,000 usd MRR","**This year my wife and I gave ourselves a strange kind of challenge:**

**Release 12 iOS apps in 12 months.**



No investors, no 20-person team, no “we’re disrupting the market” pitch.

Just two people, a laptop, and a slightly unhealthy interest in product.

We’re a young husband-and-wife team with two sons (1 and 6), two dogs (a Maltese and a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel), and a cat :) I’ve been doing mobile development for 10 years, and my wife has 5 years of experience in design and is just starting to get her hands dirty with development.

At the start of the year, our total app revenue hovered around 100 dollars a month (we had one app released until April).

Barely enough to call it a business, more like “something is trickling in.”



Now, a few months later, our total MRR is creeping toward 4,000 dollars.

https://preview.redd.it/yuxufzzo565g1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3fa977197ff4cb39b2c841399c019da1ebb1d7da

One of those apps, **Carousai**, already brings in around 1,000 dollars MRR on its own, even though we launched it only two months ago.

I want to tell this story not as some startup hero, but as the person who lives next to the developer, designer, and part-time product maniac who made it happen, my wife.



**Who is actually behind Carousai**

My wife is a product designer and also the kind of person who does not know how to “just relax.”

She either improves something, invents something, or drags someone into a new idea.

Carousai is one of her “side effects.”

It was never about walking around for months saying, “I need my own startup, I want to build a big product.”



It was more like:

“Look, people clearly struggle with this thing.”

“Yeah, I see it.”

“I’ll throw together a prototype just to test it.”



A couple of days later, there is a first design.

A couple of weeks later, there is a real app in the store.

A couple of months later, it is at 1k MRR.

Current version UI:

https://preview.redd.it/eon3jxq4365g1.png?width=4271&format=png&auto=webp&s=4685c46e9f1afa2e41e4847986a85a7a0d46e0c2



**How we ended up with the “12 apps in a year” challenge**

One night we sat down and admitted something very simple to each other.

If we keep “carefully building one product at a time,” we are going to live in pet project mode forever.



**That is how the challenge was born:**

12 apps in one year.

Small, focused, actually useful.

No endless polishing. No waiting for perfection.



**Rules were simple:**

* do not chase the perfect version, ship something rough but alive
* focus on real use cases, not “this will look amazing on Dribbble”
* every new app must teach us something, marketing, onboarding, pricing, reviews, whatever



**At the start we had:**

* a little bit of experience
* some code from older projects
* and about 100 dollars a month in “pocket money” revenue



**From “just another idea” to Carousai at 1k MRR**

At first, Carousai was just a tiny idea.

Not “let’s build a platform that does everything,” but “let’s solve one very specific problem well.”

My wife sat down and wrote out a simple user story.

Someone who wants to create content and visuals fast, without the pain of complex settings or long tutorials.

Carousel posts on Threads and Instagram are insanely popular right now, and Carousai makes them in 1–2 minutes instead of the hours we used to spend preparing a single post.



**Here is what she did in the first version:**

* she designed one clear primary flow instead of a thousand buttons
* she built an onboarding where, in 3 to 4 screens, a person understands what the app does how it is different from the rest and why it is worth their time at all
* she wired in a paid model from the start, not “we will think about monetization later”

The first version was honestly minimal. It did not include everything she wanted. But it also did not include anything extra.



**Two things mattered most here:**

1. she did not wait for perfect conditions or a “big launch,” the app went to the store early
2. we thought not only about “how to build it,” but also about “how will anyone find it”



**ASO and the storefront that made it work**

If Carousai had just been sitting in the store as “yet another utility,” we would not be talking about 1k MRR now.

Right after the first release, my wife went deep into ASO.

She:

* rewrote the description in normal human language, not in marketing buzzwords
* redesigned the screenshots so they show the user journey, not just pretty screens
* experimented with the icon until it actually stood out among competitors
* analyse keywords, selected popular, but ""not heavy""

She also used a couple of small ASO tools that helped a lot:

* services that show what people really type into search, not what sounds “logical” to us
* tools that preview our icon and screenshots inside real search results, next to other apps
* checks for localizations, so we do not ship machine translation that looks embarrassing

In the end, most of Carousai’s organic traffic did not come “out of nowhere.”

https://preview.redd.it/49vvzs4k465g1.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=09b1860f52504888e7c7f73f095d3c4df2949354

It came from search. People typed in their problems in the store and actually found us.



**What makes Carousai different from a hundred similar apps**

From the outside, it is easy to say,

“Okay, another app. There are a million of those.”



But when you see it from the inside, you notice the details:

* my wife spends hours polishing flows until the user literally does not have to think where to tap next
* she cares a lot about people who are not technical, not designers, but still want a decent result
* she always builds around one rule, the user should get a first result as fast as possible, not after 15 minutes of settings, but after a couple of simple actions



**People seem to feel this.**

Carousai did not blow up overnight.

It felt more like slowly tightening a screw:

* onboarding improved a bit, conversion went up
* paywall text changed, more people started buying
* screen order was adjusted, fewer people dropped off



Then one day we just looked at the numbers and realized:

This “let’s just try it” app is now doing around 1k MRR.



**From 100 dollars to almost 4k MRR**

The most interesting part is that Carousai is not alone.

It is part of a bigger system.



Since we started the challenge, we have already shipped 10 apps, with 2 more in progress.

Sometimes the format hits the mark, sometimes a narrow niche works, sometimes it is a mix of a good use case and solid ASO.



**Carousai is one of the newest launches.**

We shipped it only two months ago, and it already brings in roughly a quarter of our total revenue.

The rest of the apps form a solid base under it, and together the MRR is pushing toward four thousand.

At the beginning, this was just that small 100 dollar line in a spreadsheet, “for coffee and snacks.”

Now it is starting to look like a real, living portfolio, growing not because we got lucky once, but because we keep shipping small products and iterating on them.



And yes, we still have two more apps to build if we want to finish this 12-apps challenge honestly.",FlimsyWing9,1pdx8al,SideProject,04-12-2025,12:04:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pdx8al/12_apps_in_2025_challenge_with_my_wife_4000_usd/
I developed my receipt scanner into a full blown money management PWA,"Some years ago I've tried several money manager and budgeting apps, Excel spreadsheets, and so-called expense trackers. For me, the effort to enter data as detailed as I wanted was always far too high. They often look nice and are easy to use on the surface.

But things get complicated when you need to enter a large grocery haul, for example. I don't want to just write down ""Supermarket, $220.70"" or ""Groceries, $220.70"".

The idea was born: automatically analyze a photo of a receipt with software. After a lot of trial and error, tinkering, and programming, it worked quite well and was perfect for my needs.

Apocha is a PWA with data sync between all devices. Share your account with you partner or family members. Snap your receipt on iPhone at the store, analyze on your MacBook at home, and review with your partner on Android.

Compared to other expense tracker apps Apocha has several advantages:

* **Receipt Scanner**: Scans images and PDF down to the last item
* **Detailed automatic categorization**: every individual line item goes into one of 5000+ hierarchical categories
* **Matrix like analysis**: crosscut the item categories with your personal receipt tags
* **Import receipts and invoices by email**: auto-forward your digital invoices and amazon order confirmations
* **Recurring transactions**: manage recurring transactions with different billing intervals such as rent, subscriptions, insurances, and so on
* **Spending pattern detection**: Apocha's pattern radar finds everything, your forgotten subscription and your weekly lottery ticket you've never won with
* **Full text search and advanced filtering**: google your receipts
* **Export into you calendar app**: have your transactions in your calendar app and get reminders for upcoming payments
* **Multiple highly configurable widget based dashboards**: See your money the way you want
* **Hierarchical financial accounts**: implement your personal account model to create a budgeting system, e.g. envelope budgeting with 4 accounts for the weeks of a month, accounts for spending categories, sinking funds to save for the next gadget and so on.
* **Support of multiple currencies**: pay by card in EUR and account gets debited in USD
* **Excel download**: download all your data as an Excel file for further analyses

An API with which you can fetch your data for Excel or your your own apps in real time is in the making.

Built a tool to save event photos from getting lost. Still figuring out how to get it in front of more people,"Hey everyone,

I run a photo-booth business for weddings and events, and over time I noticed the same problem: guests take a ton of photos, but most never make it to the hosts. Some end up in WhatsApp groups, some in Google Drive, some just sit forgotten in a phone’s camera roll.

A few apps tried to fix this, Wedshoots being one of the most popular, but most guests never actually used them. Downloading an app for a single event is just too much friction.

So I built GuestShoot, a simple web gallery where guests join via QR code or link, no app, no signup. They can upload photos, videos, leave voice messages, and see everything in a live slideshow. Hosts keep all the memories organized and can download them anytime.

I’ve been testing it with my photo-booth events, and it’s going well so far, but now I’m struggling with the next step: getting more users outside my local network.

Looking for a Technical Partner to Build and Own the Product Side — Equity + Fast Execution,"I’m building a real-world services platform in a sector I’ve worked in for over 15 years. The operational flow, supplier behaviour and demand patterns are already understood at a deep level — this isn’t a theoretical problem or a “maybe this will work” idea. It’s a gap I’ve lived inside for more than a decade.

I’m also in conversations with a GTM specialist who will take ownership of acquisition, liquidity, retention and early growth once the product is ready. The commercial side will be strong — what I need now is the technical partner.

I’m looking for a technical co-founder who actually wants ownership, not a side project. The product scope and direction are already defined; the next step is execution. Ideally you can lead the architecture, build the first MVP in ~4–6 weeks, and take long-term responsibility for the technical roadmap. Location isn’t important — consistent communication and pace are.

You’d be building with someone who understands the industry end-to-end and moves quickly. There won’t be slow decision cycles or vague vision. What I value most: reliability, technical maturity, and wanting to build something meaningful from zero rather than jump between freelance contracts. Equity is flexible and earned based on contribution — the goal is to build this properly together.

* Their specific **vulnerabilities** that you can exploit.
* **Concrete recommendations** on how to outsmart them.

**The Key USP (my main challenge):** I guarantee delivery of the complete report in **24 hours or less**. If I'm late, it's free. 

# The Ask & The Offer

I’m looking for feedback from fellow builders: especially those who work in performance marketing or e-commerce.

1. **Product clarity:** Is the value clear enough? Does the pay-per-report model make sense?
2. **Conversion:** Is the pricing structure compelling?

**OFFER:** I am giving away **5 free reports** in exchange for detailed, structured feedback on the report's quality and the website experience.

Drop a comment or DM me if you're a PPC manager ready to trade an analysis for honest feedback!

How do you do Knowledge Transfer when leaving your org ?,"I recently switched to a new role and during my notice period a new tech lead joined and i had to provide him all the knowledge which i had on projects i built there, but felt the need to have a saas or tool to streamline the KT process, also there is an issue of offboarding, 

There are so many onboarding apps but not a single one that properly does offboarding for example archiving slack messages, revoking access etc, this led me to scratch my own itch and build [https://exitfox.com/](https://exitfox.com/) i basically vibe coded it for now to understand if there is any demand for such a product but i feel offboarding is actually a huge problem, along with KT, i feel it is much easier to explain what you have built to ChatGPT or any LLM than an actual human, the questions are outside their scope of knowledge and sometimes they dont even know the framework in use, what do you guys think of this ?

I built an AI-Powered Video Interviews & CV Screening Agent,"Hello! 👋🏻

Excited to launch my latest side hustle built with my partner, [AI Recruiter](https://www.ai-recruiter.com/).

The biggest time sink in recruiting is the initial L1 screening. We built a complete ATS/CRM to eliminate that bottleneck using AI:

* **AI Avatar Interviews:** Candidates apply and are immediately screened 24/7 by an AI Avatar.
* **Automated Scoring:** The system instantly calculates scores and ranks candidates directly in the CRM dashboard.
* **All-in-One ATS:** Full functionality for job creation, candidate tracking, and pipeline management.

What do you think of this approach to automate the hiring funnel? Any technical advice on handling high-volume video/AI load would be greatly appreciated! 🚀

I built a complex research tool using only Vanilla JS and IndexedDB (No React/Vue). Roast my code/product.,"Hi everyone,

I’m a developer based in Turkey. While working on academic research, I got frustrated with existing tools. They were either too clunky, required heavy installations, or didn't handle ""visualizing"" connections between papers well.

So, I spent the last few months building **citavers** as a side project.

**The Tech Stack (The fun part):** I decided to go against the grain and use **Zero Frameworks**.

* **Frontend:** Pure Vanilla JS (ES6 Modules).
* **State Management:** A custom centralized state object (no Redux).
* **Database:** Dual-mode adapter pattern. It uses **IndexedDB** for local-first storage (offline support) and syncs to PostgreSQL/S3 only if you want cloud features.
* **Visualization:** Uses `vis-network` for the paper graph.

**What it does:** It’s a local-first reference manager. You can manage papers, annotate PDFs, and (my favorite feature) generate a **Network Graph** to see how your sources connect.

**The Situation:** I have a shiny new landing page and exactly 7 registered users (and 0 active ones 😅). I’m looking for honest feedback on the UX and the ""local-first"" concept.

Been building this for a week - would love some feedback,"Hey everyone,

I kept noticing that a lot of links shared on social media look broken.. no image, weird titles, or just a raw URL with no preview at all.

Turns out most websites either don't have OG tags, have them misconfigured, or the cached version is outdated.

I'm a dev and spent the last week building a tool that might help with this. Called it LinkPreview.

What it does:

\- Analyzes any URL for OG/Twitter meta tags

\- Shows how the link looks on 21 different platforms (Facebook, X, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Slack, Discord, etc.)

\- Lets you create custom link previews if the original is broken (short URL that redirects to the original)

\- Basic security check for phishing

Would really appreciate if someone could take a look and give me honest feedback. What's missing? What sucks? What would make you actually use it?

I built Tab Master - a free Chrome extension that auto-organizes 50+ tabs and saves 80% RAM 🚀,"Hey r/SideProject! 👋

I just launched **Tab Master** - a Chrome extension I built to solve my own tab chaos problem.

## The Problem 🔥

I'm a developer and always have 30-50 tabs open across multiple projects. Finding anything was impossible, and my laptop sounded like it was taking off 🚁

## The Solution ✨

Tab Master does 3 things really well:

**1. Auto-Categorization** 🏷️
Automatically sorts tabs into Work, Shopping, Dev, Entertainment, etc. No manual tagging needed.

**2. Tab Suspension** 💾
Suspends unused tabs to free up 60-80% RAM. Keep your tabs open, but your laptop won't hate you.

**3. Save & Restore Sessions** 📁
One-click save all tabs. Restore them anytime - completely, selectively, or by category.

Plus: Lightning-fast search, Quick Restore floating button, keyboard shortcuts, and full Arabic support.

## Why I Built It 🤔

Every tab manager I tried was either:
- Too complicated (10 minutes to learn)
- Not free (premium paywalls everywhere)
- Cloud-only (privacy concerns)

So I built something simple, free, and privacy-first (100% local storage).

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks!)
- Chrome Storage API
- Manifest V3
- All local - no backend needed

## What's Next 🚀

Working on:
- Cloud sync (optional, for multi-device users)
- Custom themes
- Session analytics

## Try It 💙

Chrome Web Store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cffmohngbglhnnneppndhcifppjpmpae

It's completely free - no premium tiers, no subscriptions, no BS.

Would love your feedback! What features would make it more useful for you?

"It’s 3 AM, my brain is spinning, and I finally found something that stops the spiral without doomscrolling. (A User Story)","I’m usually a lurker here, but I wanted to share something that genuinely helped me out of a bad spot last night, in case anyone else is dealing with the same thing.

I have this toxic pattern: something stresses me out during the day, I ignore it, and then at 2 AM, when I’m trying to sleep, my brain decides it’s time to replay every mistake I’ve ever made.

Usually, I grab my phone and doomscroll Reddit or TikTok until I pass out from exhaustion. It never helps; it just numbs me out.

A few days ago, I downloaded this app called **ThunDroid AI** on a whim. I was skeptical because I’ve tried a million ""wellness"" apps, and they usually annoy me with notifications or feel too fake.

Last night, the 3 AM spiral hit hard regarding a work presentation. Instead of opening Instagram, I opened this app.

Here is exactly what happened, and why it was different:

**1. The Physical Break (2 minutes):** My heart was pounding. The app has these immediate breathing tools. I didn't want ""meditation,"" I needed a physical reset. I chose ""Box Breathing."" It’s stupid simple, but within 10 rounds, my physical panic symptoms actually dialed down from an 8 to a 4.

**2. The Brain Dump (5 minutes):** My mind was still racing. I opened the AI chat feature. I know, talking to an AI sounds weird. But here’s the thing: I knew it was a bot, which meant zero judgment. I just word-vomited all my irrational fears about failing the presentation. It didn't give me generic advice; it just asked good questions that helped me untangle the knot in my head.

**3. The Safety Net (Why I was honest):** The biggest reason I actually used it is that the app states everything is stored **locally on my iPhone**. It’s encrypted on-device. Knowing that no human would ever read my 3 AM panic-ramblings made me completely honest in a way I can't be with a regular cloud-based journal.

By 3:20 AM, I was actually calm enough to sleep. I didn't solve all my life's problems, but I stopped the spiral.

If you’re like me—skeptical of self-help apps but desperate for a tool that actually works in the middle of the night—give the 3-day trial a shot. Having the breathing tool and a safe place to vent all in one spot is more valuable than I thought it would be.

Just wanted to put that out there for the fellow insomniacs.

I built an open-source prompt system because nothing out there felt “right”.,"I’ve been experimenting with different prompt tools for months, but everything I tried felt either too bloated, too slow, or weirdly over-designed.  
So I ended up building my own version — something minimal, fast, and focused entirely on actual workflow, not aesthetics.

Here’s what it does right now:

* clean retro UI (no glass, no clutter, loads instantly)
* merged prompt sections into one simple screen
* proper OAuth setup (no more provider errors)
* a small personal library for saving custom workflows
* smoother structure under the hood so it’s easy to extend

🎢 The Small Side Project That Suddenly Started Growing,"# A few weeks ago I started building a tiny screen recorder Chrome extension.

No signups, no watermarks, no upsells — just a clean little tool I wanted for my own workflow.

https://preview.redd.it/du13ze3mi65g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d02418076fd619d867f8871f6c73aea3ebc7859

Honestly, I thought it would sit in the corner of the internet forever.

But then a few things happened..



# 🔧 The “one more tiny fix” spiral

Every night I’d open the project to tweak *one thing*…

and suddenly I’d be rewriting functions, improving the UI, polishing the flow, adding small quality-of-life stuff.

Somehow those micro-updates turned into real progress.



# ⭐ It even got a Featured Badge on the Chrome Web Store

https://preview.redd.it/kmxxo9yoi65g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=444a6d71d999f9eb9429d91ff6158672d63f1f7c

Didn’t expect that, but it was a fun boost. One of those tiny wins that keeps you moving.



# 📈 Then the first real users appeared

It had 19 users.

Two days later: 59.

https://preview.redd.it/yyppx6ari65g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc4cb7574919dfaeadb3f48aae83737519f60753

Not huge, but for a solo developer with zero marketing, it felt surreal.

People I’ve never met were actually using something I quietly built at night.



# ✨ The part I love the most

Polishing the flow, animations, timing, little UX details…

the stuff users *don’t mention* but they feel.

I’m basically building the tool I wish existed.



# 🔍 What I'm trying to figure out next

– How small utilities find an audience

– How to add delight without adding friction

– How to share progress without sounding like a sales pitch



If anyone here has built a small Chrome extension or utility and watched it slowly grow, I’d love to hear how it went for you.



# 🔗 If you want to try it

"I built a simple tool to check if a file has been modified, would love your feedback","I’ve been annoyed for a long time by how hard it is to *quickly* verify whether a file has been altered.

Most solutions out there feel way too heavy:  
– install weird software  
– create accounts  
– pay before testing anything  
– deal with complicated logs or dashboards

All I wanted was something super simple like:  
**“Drag in a file → get a clean yes/no answer → done.”**

So I built a small tool to do exactly that.

No signup, no payment walls, nothing complicated, just a way to instantly check if a file has been modified compared to its original version. It uses hash comparisons, but the UI is designed for *normal humans*, not developers.

Here’s the link if you want to try it: [**https://hashtagfile.com/**](https://hashtagfile.com/)

I’d really appreciate feedback on:

1. Does the process feel clear and trustworthy?
2. Is this actually solving a real-world problem for you?
3. What would make this more useful?

I’m not trying to sell anything,  I just want to make this genuinely helpful, especially for freelancers, lawyers, agencies, and people who deal with sensitive docs.

I just launched [Smol Launch](https://smollaunch.com), a platform that helps developers share their apps and get visibility, feedback and free backlinks. I built it because launching on Product Hunt can feel impossible if you don’t already have a big audience or a marketing budget.

I put it live two days ago and within the first 24 hours, 20 developers signed up and posted their projects. It has been really fun seeing the early traction and I’d love to keep improving it.

I’m curious to learn from this community. What are the biggest challenges you face when launching or promoting your app? I’d love to shape the platform around real problems devs deal with.

Built a tool that lets you chat with multiple AI models at the same time — worth using or nah?,"I’ve been working on a small AI project for my own workflow, and I’m trying to figure out if it’s actually useful to other people or if I’m just in my own bubble.

Basically, it lets you talk to multiple AI models **in parallel**.  
Not serially, not “switch model,” but literally get responses side-by-side in one chat. Same prompt goes out to all models instantly, and you compare the answers in one place.

My use case was comparing reasoning quality and catching mistakes faster, plus getting different perspectives without copy-pasting the same prompt a hundred times. It works well for me, but I’m not sure if that’s a niche thing or something people would actually use.

So I wanted to ask here:

– Would a tool like this actually fit into your workflow?  
– What would make it genuinely useful?  
– If you wouldn’t use it, what’s the dealbreaker?

Not selling anything. Just trying to get real feedback before I either keep building or pivot entirely. I’d rather hear the brutal truth now than waste time chasing something nobody needs.

I built 30 app MVPs in 30 days and I'm giving them ALL away for FREE,"“I don't know what to build.""

I see this everywhere. Reddit, Discord, Twitter. Developers with skills but stuck on the starting line because they can't pick an idea.

So I did something crazy:

I built 30 different mobile app MVPs in 30 days. One per day. And I'm giving them ALL away to developers who want to build them into full products.

🎯 WHY I DID THIS

The problem isn't lack of ideas. It's decision paralysis.

""Is this idea good enough?""
""Has someone already built this?""
""Will people actually use it?""
So I removed that barrier. I built the first version. Proved the concept works. Now you can take it and run.

🎁 WHAT YOU'RE GETTING

Each MVP includes:
✅ Working core functionality
✅ Basic UI/UX (clean, simple, ready to customize)
✅ Database schema
✅ Authentication flow 
✅ Deployment-ready code

What it's NOT:
❌ Production-ready (you'll need to scale it)
❌ Perfectly designed (make it yours!)
❌ Feature-complete (that's YOUR job)

Think of these as working blueprints. The hard part (starting) is done. The fun part (making it yours) is all you.

🛠️ TECH STACK
Supabase + Natively 

All modern, production-tested tech. Nothing experimental.

💡 HOW TO CLAIM AN APP

Option 1: Comment below with:
- Which app you want
- What you'd add to make it better
- Your experience level

Option 2: DM me directly

The Deal:
- Code is 100% free
- Do whatever you want with it
- Launch it, monetize it, add it to your portfolio
- Only ask: If you build something cool with it, let me know!

🎥 SEE THE APPS IN ACTION
I documented the entire build process on YouTube - every app, every feature, every decision explained, link in the comments. 

Watch how they work, see the build process, then take the code and make it 10x better.

🚀 WHY THIS MATTERS
- For beginners: Jump straight to building real features instead of todo lists
- For intermediate devs: See different architectures and patterns in action
- For entrepreneurs: Validate ideas with working prototypes
- For portfolio builders: Ship multiple projects fast

The hardest part of building isn't the code. It's starting.

So here's 30 starts. Pick one and finish it.

🔥 POPULAR COMBOS

Can't decide? Here are apps that work great together:
- Fitness Stack: Gym Tracker + Health Tracker + Meal Planner
- Productivity Suite: Task Manager + Habit Tracker + Journaling
- Travel Platform: Travel Booking + Weather + Event Finder
- Social Tools: Messaging + Couples Calendar + Social Media Feed
- Finance Hub: Personal Finance + Stock Tracker + Crypto Tracker

Build one. Then connect them. Now you've got a platform.

⚡ THE CHALLENGE FOR YOU
- Week 1: Pick an app and get it running
- Week 2: Add ONE feature that makes it yours
- Week 3: Deploy it publicly
- Week 4: Get your first 10 users

You're 4 weeks away from having a live product with real users.

What are you waiting for?

TL;DR: I built 30 mobile app MVPs. You can have any of them for free. Pick one, build it better, ship it. The ""what should I build"" problem is solved.

"Is a Chrome Extension a smart move, or do people tend to view recipes mainly on their phone? How do you determine when a hunch is worth your time?"," I’ve been working on my side project to make my Nest Hub useful again after Google killed the ""Cookbook"" feature and turned the device into an overpriced timer. One of my main goals was simply not having to interact with my computer/phone while cooking.

I tend to find a recipe on my laptop and copy paste the recipe URL to RecipeCast from the browser there, but I’m trying to figure out how to reduce friction for new users and help gain some traction.

My current idea is a Chrome Extension. The idea is a ""one-click"" cast from your desktop browser: you find a recipe on your laptop, click to open the extension which strips out everything besides the recipe, and then I can cast it to my kitchen display.

I’m stuck on whether this is a worthwhile investment. Do people still browse for recipes on a desktop/laptop, or has that behavior moved 100% to mobile? I’d love to know if a desktop workflow would actually be a selling point, or if I’m optimizing for a workflow that doesn’t exist anymore.

AI voicebots struggling with complex customer service issues. Has anyone else had this problem?,"I was testing ai voicebots for customer support on my side project, and while they work great for basic tasks (order status, tracking updates), they really struggle with anything more complicated. One issue was a customer asking for detailed refund steps based on their order history and the bot just kept giving generic responses. Another time, there was a billing issue that clearly needed human intervention, but the bot just looped instead of escalating the issue.

I've tried tweaking the flows, but no luck in getting it to handle more advanced queries. It's frustrating because the bot works fine for simple stuff, but as soon as things get complex, it falls short. I've read that [tenios voicebots](https://www.tenios.de/en/overview-voicebot) might handle complex queries better, but I’m not sure if it's worth trying.

The idea of ​​the project is to offer an open space for developers, teams and users, with clear functions for each role:

🧑‍💻 System roles

Developers / Publishers

They will be able to upload free apps without limit.

They will have a complete panel, inspired by Play Console.

They will be able to manage versions, statistics and more.


Users

You will be able to download, leave reviews, give your opinion and even send gifts to the developers.

There will be clear rules on permitted content and moderation.


Teams

A team can have up to 10 developers under the same console.

Designed for groups, communities or small startups.


🎁 Benefits and extras

I am considering adding:

Verification badges/icons

Ad-free mode

Profile customization options

Rewards and perks for both sides (users and devs)

Built a 3D Interactive Portfolio Builder - Looking for Feedback,"Hey r/SideProject community!

I've been working on a 3D interactive portfolio builder service for the past few months. The goal is to help developers, designers, and professionals create portfolios that actually stand out from generic templates.

Tech Stack:

* Next.js 14 (App Router)
* Three.js 
* Framer Motion for animations
* Tailwind CSS
* Vercel deployment

Key Features:

1. Interactive 3D Themes - Earth, Space, and Mountain themes with actual 3D elements
2. Smooth Animations - Parallax scrolling, hover effects, page transitions
3. Mobile-First - Fully responsive, optimized for all devices
4. Code Export - Get clean React/Tailwind code (not locked into a platform)
5. Performance Focus - Lighthouse scores 90+ across metrics

The Problem I'm Solving:  
Most portfolio builders offer template-based designs that all look similar. I wanted to create something that feels more like an interactive experience than just another website.

Live Demo: [https://alex-portfolio-lime-two.vercel.app/](https://alex-portfolio-lime-two.vercel.app/)

Looking For Feedback On:

1. UI/UX - How intuitive is the design?
2. Performance - Does it feel smooth on your device?
3. Value Proposition - Would you/your clients pay for something like this?
4. Features - What's missing that would be useful?

Current Status:

* MVP complete
* Live demo available
* Starting to take first clients
* Adding more theme variations

This started as a learning project with Three.js and evolved into a service idea. Would appreciate any technical or business feedback!

Note: This is a service, not an open-source tool (though I'm considering open-sourcing some components later).

That’s when I landed on NetWorthPointer.com. I wanted it it to be plain, useful, and instantly memorable. The .com extension was vital because users instinctively trust it, and for finance or wealth content, you will agree with me that trust matters.

“Net worth” captures the main idea. “Pointer” signals clarity. Together, the name promises a clear, trusted place to track your own net worth and see celebrity wealth at a glance.

I pictured a clean dashboard: one number that sums it all up, with asset and debt breakdowns, live market updates, alerts for big swings, and a net worth calculator tied to source data. A section for verified rich lists, transparent and citable.

I was not trying to beat the big publishers. I was trying to create a reference people can trust.

The problem is, I’m struggling to build it and I’m at the point of considering passing the name to someone who can maximize its potential.

If you’re building finance tools, a news site, or a data product, this name could save months of brand work. I can share the naming notes if you want.

I’m looking for ideas, feedback, or potential collaborators but if the name fits your project, reach out and make it yours.",Practical_Excuse_932,1pdztl3,SideProject,04-12-2025,14:20:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pdztl3/choosing_a_project_name_that_matters/
I quit my 9-5 to build a travel app after a disastrous trip to Marrakesh with 5 engineers (RouteWhiz MVP),"Hi Everyone, I’m Omer. 

5 months ago, I handed in my resignation letter at my stable corporate job in Istanbul. No backup plan, limited savings, and a lot of anxiety.

My parents think I’m reckless. My friends think I’m brave. Honestly? **I’m terrified.**

I’m scared of failing. I’m scared of burning through my savings. I’m scared of what people will say if I have to crawl back to a corporate job in 6 months.

But I had to do this. And the reason goes back to a ""budget student trip"" I took to Marrakesh with 4 of my engineer friends during university.

**The ""Engineer's Paradox""** Here’s the irony: We were 5 engineering students. We spent our days learning how to optimize complex systems, algorithms, and data structures. We thought we were smart.

We found cheap flight tickets, booked an Airbnb, and listed the top places to visit. We thought we were ready.

**Then, reality hit us in the face.**

* **The Clash:** We booked a tour for the Agafay Desert and a waterfall excursion. Because we didn't account for transit times and traffic realities, the tours overlapped. We lost money and, worse, we lost time.
* **The Heartbreak:** We walked all the way to a museum we were dying to see. We assumed we could just buy tickets at the door. We didn't know they sold out days in advance. We got turned away at the gate.
* **The Panic:** Due to poor timing, we missed our train. We had to scramble for the second one, running through the station with heavy backpacks, barely making it before the doors closed.

We were exhausted. We were stressed. We involuntarily skipped half the places we wanted to see because our ""plan"" wasn't actually a plan—it was just a wish list.

That night, we realized something: **Google Maps tells you** ***how*** **to get there, but it doesn't tell you** ***when*** **to go, or in** ***what order*** **to visit 10 different places so you don't miss that last train.**

**The Leap (and the Fear)** Fast forward to today. That itch never left me. I realized that existing travel apps were either too complicated (spreadsheets with a UI) or too simple (just a list of spots).

So, I started building **RouteWhiz** on nights and weekends.

When I decided to go full-time, the fear was paralyzing. I’m 24. I don’t have a huge safety net. I have a girlfriend who I want to build a future with. The thought of financial instability kept me up at night.

But she was the one who pushed me. She told me to bet on myself.

**Where I am now (Month 3)** I’m building this solo. I’m handling the code (**React Native**), the backend (moved to self-hosted Hetzner to save costs), and the marketing (which I suck at).

My goal isn't to be the next Unicorn. Honestly? **I just want to build a tool that** ***I*** **can rely on for my future adventures with my girlfriend.** I want to make sure our next trip is remembered for the moments we enjoyed together, not the flights we almost missed or the stress of planning.

I’m documenting this journey, the bugs, the marketing fails, and hopefully, the first dollars.

If you’ve ever had a travel disaster because of bad planning, I’d love to hear it so I don’t feel like the only ""failed engineer"" out there. And if you have advice for a solo founder trying to survive mentally, I’m all ears.  
Even though my app still sucks if anyone is interested

NoxGear 20% Off Discount Code,"I’ve been using the Noxgear Tracer 2 for a couple months now and it’s easily the best visibility gear I’ve tried for night running. The brightness is legit — cars can see me from way down the road, and I feel noticeably safer on early morning and evening runs. The vest is super lightweight, doesn’t bounce, and fits cleanly over a jacket or hoodie without feeling bulky. Battery life has been solid and charging through USB-C is a big improvement over older reflective gear that relied on replaceable batteries.

Only downsides are small things: you have to remember to charge it, and the straps feel a little delicate compared to traditional high-viz vests. If you’re expecting something rugged or heavy-duty, it’s not that. This is strictly a visibility tool, not something built to take a beating. But for what it’s designed for, it works extremely well.

If you run, bike, or walk in low light, Noxgear is worth it. It gives you 360-degree visibility without weighing you down, and it genuinely reduces the anxiety of being near traffic in the dark. Would buy again and recommend to anyone training outside before sunrise or after work.

Cornbread Hemp 20% Off Discount - ANDYHEMP,"I’ve been using Cornbread Hemp’s full-spectrum gummies for a while now, mainly for sleep and general stress, and they’ve been one of the more consistent CBD products I’ve tried. The effects are subtle but noticeable — it doesn’t knock you out or make you feel drugged, but it does help you unwind and fall asleep a little easier. I also like that the formula is USDA-organic and made from hemp flower only, which feels cleaner compared to a lot of budget CBD brands.

The downside is that it’s full-spectrum, so there’s trace THC. It’s mild, but if you want something guaranteed THC-free, this isn’t it. The results also vary depending on the day — some nights it works great, others it feels lighter, and the price is definitely on the higher side for the dosage.

Overall, Cornbread Hemp is solid if you’re looking for a clean, organic CBD option that actually takes the edge off without heavy side effects. It’s not a miracle fix, but it’s reliable enough that I keep a jar around for nights when I want something natural to help me wind down.

"Built my first side project, need opinion.","I built an AI receptionist that answers calls and books appointments. This is my first side project and I'd really appreciate if you could check it out and give me your honest opinion.

It uses ElevenLabs for the voice and Twilio for the phone system. The AI can answer frequently asked questions and schedule appointments. Right now it's just a demo but it actually works.

The thing I'm most curious about is whether it sounds natural or not. I've tested it myself but I've been working on it so long that I can't really judge anymore. I also don't know if this is something people would actually find useful.

If you have a few minutes, could you try calling it? I'm looking for any feedback really. Does it sound weird? Is the conversation flow awkward? Would you be annoyed talking to it? Is this even a real problem worth solving?

Demo: [projectske.com](http://projectske.com)

Some specific things I'm wondering about:

Would small businesses actually want this or is it unnecessary?

Should the AI tell people upfront that it's AI or does that defeat the purpose?

What would make this more useful if you were going to use it?

This is my first real project so I honestly have no idea if it's good or not. Any feedback would be really helpful, even if it's critical. I just want to know if I should keep working on this or move on to something else.

Working on a gym-RPG (you rank up by actually lifting IRL). Would love feedback on whether this is fun or dumb.,"So I’ve been building this weird gym + RPG mashup for the past few months.
Basically you get ranked based on your real lifts (we calculate a “power index” from reps + exercise type), and you can challenge other players to stuff like “max pull-ups in 10 min” or “heaviest bench with clean form.”

There’s also a bounty board where you can post things like “nobody can out-deadlift me for 20 gold.” It’s all virtual currency for now, just for fun.

Verification is done by uploading a short clip. AI checks form + timestamps, then a human (me or another admin) gives final confirmation.

I’m mostly trying to figure out:
	•	does the ranking system make sense?
	•	is the match/challenge idea fun or too gimmicky?
	•	what would make you actually want to try something like this?

Hume Health 20% Off Discount Code,"I’ve been using the Hume Health Body Pod for a while and it’s been a mixed experience. On the positive side, it gives you way more data than a normal scale — body fat, muscle mass, water levels, visceral fat, metabolic rate, all of it. When it works, the trend tracking is actually useful. Seeing changes over weeks instead of obsessing over a single weigh-in helps make sense of training and diet, especially if you're lifting and bodyweight alone doesn’t tell the full story.

The downside is consistency. The readings can jump around if you weigh in at different times or if your hydration is off, and sometimes the app connection is flaky. I’ve also seen a lot of people complain about customer support being slow or unhelpful, which tracks with some of the hiccups I’ve had getting the device synced. It’s not something I’d treat as medically accurate — it’s more of a directional tool than a precise measurement device.

Overall, Hume Health is good if you want more data than a basic scale and you’re fine with treating the numbers as trends instead of absolutes. If you’re expecting perfectly accurate body fat readings or flawless app syncing, you’ll probably be disappointed. But if you’re already tracking workouts and want extra metrics to compare week to week, it’s solid enough to keep using.

Tools for monitoring Facebook groups for marketing?,"The folks in my target niche hang out in some large and active Facebook groups. I’ve gotten great traction replying to their posts with relevant content from my app that adds value for them. Admins were all good with it too. 

What’s challenging is monitoring the groups is manual - have to just refresh the site/app. To compound the challenge, the biggest group has admin approval on, so a few times a day, a flood of posts will go up, and I want to be early in replying to maximize visibility. 

My impression is Facebook is a walled garden, but are there tools that would simplify monitoring for posts? In a perfect world I could wire up notifications for myself (Discord, email, whatever - I’m flexible) with each new post’s content & link so I can jump in if it’s relevant to my app.

\- Profitability estimates

\- Community sentiment

\- Actual customer leads from Reddit/HN/Indie Hackers

I built an automated court scraper because finding a good lawyer shouldn't be a guessing game,"Hey everyone,

I recently realized how incredibly difficult it is for the average person to find a suitable lawyer for their specific situation. There's two ways the average person look for a lawyer, a simple google search which is based on SEO ( google doesn't know to rank attorneys ) or through connections, which is basically flying blind. Trying to navigate court systems to actually see an attorney’s track record is a nightmare, the portals are clunky, slow, and often require manual searching case-by-case, it's as if it's built by people who DOESN'T want you to use their system.

So, I built **CourtScrapper** to fix this.

It’s an open-source Python tool that automates extracting case information from the Dallas County Courts Portal (with plans to expand). It lets you essentially ""background check"" an attorney's actual case history to see what they’ve handled and how it went.

**What it does:**

* **Multi-Attorney Search:** You can input a list of attorneys and it searches them all concurrently.
* **Deep Filtering:** Filters by case type (e.g., Felony), charge keywords (e.g., ""Assault"", ""Theft""), and date ranges.
* **Captcha Handling:** Automatically handles the court’s captchas using 2Captcha (or manual input if you prefer).
* **Data Export:** Dumps everything into clean Excel/CSV/JSON files so you can actually analyze the data.

**The Tech Stack:**

* Python
* Playwright (for browser automation/stealth)
* Pandas (for data formatting)

I’d love for you guys to roast my code or give me some feedback. I’m looking to make this more robust and potentially support more counties.

"I’ve built many projects, but perfectionism + fear of promoting them always killed my momentum. So I created one “umbrella project” to unify everything I build.","I’ve been an indie developer for a long time, always working solo.  
Over the years I’ve created a lot of projects - most of them failed, a few of them grew to hundreds of thousands or even millions of monthly visits. They still exist today and they’re still successful, but they’ve always stayed in a very “passive” category. Most of them relied on AdSense and similar models, which meant:

  
*no direct users - no interaction - no pressure to communicate.*

  
It was a comfortable place for someone like me - without the need to talk much about what I build.

But at the same time, my brain doesn’t really stay still. I constantly come up with **new ideas**, new tools, new small projects. I think in experiments. I build because something sparks in my head and I want to see it exist, not because I planned a product roadmap. This is how I’ve always worked.

There’s also the way my mind tends to operate. I can hyperfocus intensely on building something, polish it, finish it… and then ***lose all ability to promote*** or talk about it. Not because I don’t care, but because the moment something needs social exposure, perfectionism kicks in.  
I convince myself it isn’t ready, that one detail is missing, that I should wait for a “real” final version. And after all coding - no desire to promote - because I feel still like not ready. 

  
*I build → I release → and I disappear from it.*

Before I ever thought seriously about SaaS, a few people using two of my older projects reached out and **asked me if I offered an API for specific pieces of data** they saw on my sites. That became the first clue that some of the things I’d built internally had real external value too — and also that there might be a cleaner way to structure all of it.

At the same time, almost everything I built was a direct reaction to something I personally needed.

1.  When I needed a reliable way to generate invoices *→* I wrote my own invoicing API.
2.  When I got deep into AI music and wanted a specific creative workflow *→* I built my own AI lyrics generator.
3.  When I needed to communicate comfortably with friends who speak only Russian - and I kept sending them badly timed or awkwardly translated messages *→* I built a browser extension to fix that problem for myself.

This kept happening: every time I needed something, I built a small tool for it.  
And over years, I ended up with a growing pile of utilities and mini-apps scattered across different projects - **each solving a real problem for me, but with no shared structure**, no central home, and often duplicated logic in different places.

So those two things:

1. people asking for API access 
2. *and* me repeatedly building tools to solve my own needs 

*→* finally connected.

  
***Their interest + my needs + my chaos of scattered utilities = one clear direction.***

That’s when the idea clicked: instead of scattering tools across multiple projects, why not put everything in one unified place?

So that’s what I’m building now — one umbrella project where all my APIs, utilities and mini-apps live together.

* One domain (I found a 3-letter domain). 
* One user account. 
* One credit system \[One payment integration\]
* One API key 

that unlocks everything. Think about it like RapidAPI (where most APIs there are not working properly or abandoned :) but also plus UI tools and Apps.

And what feels strange writing this is that I'm talking about it **before** it’s finished. That’s new for me. I normally wait for the perfect “final” version as I already said. Someone once told me that my perfectionism makes me finish projects but prevents me from ever sharing them. So I’m trying something different this time: 

*talking about it while it’s still in progress*.

And guess what? **This project is essentially endless**.  
I can keep adding new utilities, new tools, new small apps.  
I still have many old internal tools to migrate and plenty of new ideas waiting.  
There’s no final release, no “this is the last version” moment — which oddly makes it easier to stay connected to it and not mentally abandon it the moment it's “done.”

And honestly, writing about it here and saying “hey, this exists” feels strangely motivating.

*I have 6 customers currently that making about \~700k API requests monthly.*

*So, my advice to you -* build something you love, and make sure it also fits the way your brain and limitations work. Don’t measure yourself by what you can force yourself to do, but by what drains you and kills your motivation.

If anyone finds my journey interesting, I can share more in a second part - whatever makes you wondering. ",bundors,1pe1lzy,SideProject,04-12-2025,15:37:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pe1lzy/ive_built_many_projects_but_perfectionism_fear_of/

"450 hours and 10 months later, I released my side project to 0 customers AMA","I've been working mornings and weekends on a side project since March 2025 and spent probably \~450 hours in total building [FunnelGen](https://funnelgen.io/) before launching a couple weeks ago.

[Funnelgen specific github activity](https://preview.redd.it/zkv181z9475g1.png?width=1836&format=png&auto=webp&s=5548f36e65f265b53ade8475d4446747c2502ff1)

I graduated in 2015 and worked my way from Jr to Staff Software Engineer at my first company and then Head of Software Engineering at my second company. With that experience, I felt I could build a product myself that would compete downstream with products like SendOwl, ShopRocket, embedded SamCart etc. I am hoping that building a lean company and passing the savings on to my customers allows me to build out a niche within the broader market of selling digital products online.

One of the tricks I used to build motivation was I would start my day with a 2milligram nicotine gum, a big pot of coffee and turn off all phone/notifications for an hour or so before starting my real job. Would highly recommend a routine approach to slowly move towards your goals.

Since launch, I have realized I have no idea how to market this thing and as a result have zero users. I've tried adding SEO to the blog and doc sections of my marketing site to generate natural google traffic but none has trickled in yet. I tried launching on [SaasHunt](https://saashunt.best/projects/funnelgen) but that got me zero traffic as well.

One lesson I would offer is to use the minimum infrastructure possible until getting customers. I've spent \~$1000 so far by engineering this as if I have customers. Things like launching a real stage environment, using multi availability zone for database, paying for google workspace, etc.

An app to replace unsafe .env files.,"Usually developers use a .env file to store secrets during development. But this is risky.

A .env file contains important information like API keys and database credentials, and because it’s stored in plain text, it can be leaked by malware or by accident.

But the most serious risk is mistakes made not by you but by AI agents.

Recent research by Cline and Google Antigravity showed that manipulated malicious search results can cause an AI agent to read a .env file via terminal commands and send its contents to an attacker’s server.

LocalKeys is as easy to use as a .env file, but with two key differences: secrets can only be used with the user’s approval, and all secrets are stored encrypted.

There’s no learning curve for usage — you simply replace your usual 'npm start' with 'localkeys run --project=myapp -- npm start'.

It supports most programming languages, and I personally use LocalKeys when developing with Node.js.

The app is built with Electron, supports macOS and Windows, and Linux support is planned.

"NextPing - a chat app that lets you schedule messages, shedule status, and shedule media.","Hi everyone,

I'm builded a chat app called

NextPing. It focuses on integrating communication and time management seamlessly for users.

Scheduled messaging and multimedia sharing. Users can plan text, images, videos, and documents to be sent at a future date/time, reducing the risk of forgetting important communications.

•	Scheduled audio and video calls. Users can set up their voice or video calls ahead of time, improving planning and coordination.

•	Reminders linked directly to chat messages. Long-pressing a message to create a reminder with a chosen alert time helps users remember follow-ups without switching apps.

•	A unified reminders tab where all reminders set from messages or manual notes are managed in one place, closing the loop between chat and task management.

•	Personalization features like rounded-square profile pictures that reflect user preferences in UI appearance.

NextPing is a messaging app that doubles as a smart personal assistant and planner, focusing heavily on scheduling and reminders linked closely with conversations.

"Launched my macOS app 2 weeks ago — transparent results, traffic, sales, and what I learned","Two weeks ago I launched [MacTiler](https://mactiler.com/), a macOS window manager I built for my own workflow and eventually turned into a small indie product. Here are the transparent metrics from the first 14 days — sales, traffic, conversion rates, and what actually moved the needle.

# 📊 Traffic & Funnel (last 2 weeks)

* **\~520 unique users**
* **\~620 visits**

Where the traffic came from:

* r/macapps **launch post** → strongest source by far (\~20k views)
* A few small posts on other subreddits (\~1.5k views each), not highly targeted
* Product Hunt → **almost no reactions**, post sank instantly
* SEO → just beginning (organic Google only)
* No YouTube, no TikTok, no Google Ads

# 🆓 Trials & Sales

* **53 trials** started
* **8 paid licenses** (excluding my own + 2 tester licenses)
* **Landing → Trial: \~10.2%**
* **Trial → Paid: \~15.1%**
* **Landing → Paid: \~1.5%**
* Most purchases same day, fastest in \~15 min
* **Revenue:** **$192.90** (all during -30% BF promo)
* Post-BF December: 0 sales so far

# Licensing breakdown:

* **5× Personal**
* **3× Family**
* **0× Business**

# 🧪 Reddit Ads experiment (BF weekend)

* 147k impressions / 560 clicks
* CPC \~$0.29, cost $162 
* Google Analytics shows far fewer real visits → metrics inflated 
* Result: **no measurable sales impact / money burn**

# 🌍 Localization

Added 11 languages + auto-detect

Early signs:

* Better engagement (especially DE, JA, ES, FR)
* Slight increase in time-on-page
* Too early for real conclusions but promising

# 📨 Waitlist results

* **10 people** joined the waitlist before launch
* They got **-40%** (better than BF -30%)
* **0 purchases** — tiny sample, but interesting data point

# 💬 User feedback

Feedback volume is small, but:

* Very positive overall
* People especially appreciate multi-monitor handling
* The **“swap entire monitors with window positions preserved”** feature is the standout
* Stability feedback has been good — the app “just works,” in users' words

# 🧠 Takeaways so far

* Organic Reddit posts beat paid Reddit ads by miles
* Trial → paid conversion is healthy
* Landing → trial (\~10%) is decent, but can be improved
* Localization is worth the work
* Traffic drops sharply post-Black-Friday, so slow December is expected
* SEO + Reddit + word-of-mouth are probably my long-term channels
* Seeing real users try something you built is addictive

Honestly, I didn’t expect much — it was my first side project, and I just wanted some honest feedback.

But the response surprised me.

A few people actually used it and pointed out smaller things I never noticed:
	•	the UI felt too plain
	•	spacing looked off on some screens
	•	mobile layout needed better handling
	•	conversion flow needed polishing

So I spent the last few days improving everything — not a massive redesign, just incremental cleanup and performance tweaks.
It genuinely helped me understand how “small improvements” matter way more than I realized.

This week, I’m looking for more developer/creator feedback on:
	•	layout balance
	•	feel of minimalism vs usefulness
	•	page flow
	•	anything that looks “off” or could be made smoother

Landing: [https://jobtrakify-home.vercel.app/](https://jobtrakify-home.vercel.app/)

# Core Features:

* **Application Tracking Dashboard** – add, edit, filter, import/export jobs
* **AI Assistant** – analyzes job descriptions, drafts cover letters, and answers questions about your job pipeline
* **Statistics Page** – charts, success rate, rejection ratio, interview tracking
* **Import from .TXT** or add manually
* **Dynamic status updates**
* **Authentication (Google)**
* **Clean UI focused on clarity + productivity**

I built this because I needed something simple but powerful, while applying to jobs myself, spreadsheets just weren’t enough.

The beta is completely free. I'd really love feedback:

* What features are missing?
* What would make it worth paying for in V1?
* Is the UX clear enough?

If anyone is building something similar or wants to share insights about launching small SaaS products, I’m open to all suggestions.

Rent vs Buy: 35 year old tech worker wants to buy a 2.5M home in the Bay Area. Should they?,"Here's a scenario we recently ran with Planwell's financial planning webapp. A 35 year old tech employee working for a FAANG is currently renting in San Francisco. Here is their financial situation.

* Family income: $450,000
* Expenses: $11,000
* Monthly Rent: $5000
* Retirement accounts: $800K
* Investment accounts: $1M
* Cash accounts: $100,000

Summary: They may be better off renting with their current income, expense levels and assets accumulated. However, if they want to buy, their maximum home affordability is $1.7M. Alternatively, they can boost their savings by $52K per year to be able to buy the $2.5M home and still retire by age 65.

Here's a detailed breakdown.

**Scenario 1: Rent**  
When we ran their financial projection in Planwell, here's what we got. They can comfortably retire at age 65. Their liquid net worth lasts until age 95 (consisting of retirement and taxable accounts).

[Liquid net worth by age](https://preview.redd.it/txbuw9y7605g1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=443cd2d4c5fbddf9b00c9a979b8d18f3299c8605)

**Scenario 2: Buy a $2.5M home in the Bay Area**

Same financial situation, except the $5000 in rent is replaced with a home mortgage + property tax.

* Family income: $450,000
* Expenses: $11,000
* Home value: $2.5M; property tax: 1.25% annual, HOA: $200 per month. Downpayment: $500K
* Retirement accounts: $800K
* Investment accounts: $1M
* Cash accounts: $100,000

Here are their results: They clearly cannot retire by age 65, in fact they'll have to keep working till 75.

It turns out the **maximum home value they can afford and still retire by 65 is $1.7M**, not $2.5M.

If they want to still buy the $2.5M home, then they will need an additional savings of $52K per year. This can be achieved by boosting their income by 8%(maybe through a new job or promotion) and cutting expenses by 11%.

I built a local-first habit tracker because I got tired of apps that require a login just to track a habit.,"[Starting and Creating a habit](https://reddit.com/link/1pe2sul/video/37hmx5ykg75g1/player)

  
  
I tried using popular apps like I Am Sober and such but they all too limiting:

* Some require sign ups or at least want you to sign up
* Too many features that 90% of them I don't even use
* Limited habits, mostly bad habits and a limited amount of them
* Inability to export the habits or gate-kept behind login screens

**My solution Proficio:**

* A local first Desktop/Android app built on Tauri and Sveltekit habit tracker that actually respects the user giving you only what you need.
* No logins
* Unlimited habits, whenever positive or negative or 1 or 100 of them.
* Data ownership, you own the data living on your device which you can easily export to CSV with one click.

**The tech stack:**

* Core: Rust (Tauri)
* UI: Sveltekit
* Storage: SQlite (Local)

It’s open source (MIT). I’d love to hear your thoughts on the approach!

[2.99 → Free] [42 Hours Only] Timix – Modern Timer App with 15 Actions (Combined),"Hey everyone,

I’m the solo dev behind Timix — a cross-platform timer app I’ve been building over the past couple of years for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch.

A while ago I shared some promo codes on Reddit, and I really enjoyed the feedback and the conversations that followed. So I decided to make Timix completely free for the next 42 hours so anyone can try it without needing a code.

I originally built Timix because I wanted a clean timer that could support any routine. Imagine multiple timers running in a sequence with visual cues, voice alerts, Shortcuts automations, 15+ actions in total — all the stuff regular timer apps don’t usually do. This opens up a new, effortless way to build your own routines and be more creative.

Over time, people started using it for workouts, studying, cooking, meditation, and anything that needs structure.

# What Timix can do that most Timers can't

* Cross-platform App (iPhone, iPad, Mac, Watch)
* 15+ actions that can be combined (voice, flash, vibrations, countdown, HomeKit, Shortcuts, Open URL, and more)
* Siri & Shortcuts Support - say ""Hey Siri, Pause Timix""
* Share your templates and routines with your friends
* Widgets to Run Timers from Home screen or Lock Screen
* No ads, no tracking — just a clean tool that works

Built a CLI that turns your Git history into a career document,"Been working on [BragDoc](http://bragdoc.ai) \- a tool that reads your Git history and automatically tracks your achievements for performance reviews.

  
Every review cycle devs forget half the things they actually shipped, then spend hours scrolling through old commits trying to remember what happened. We got tired of that, so we built a fix.  


It's a CLI tool that reads your Git history locally and pulls out achievement summaries for performance reviews, 1-on-1s, and career docs. Built for individual devs to own their career narrative, not for team tracking.

  
Runs locally (privacy-first), supports multiple LLM providers (including local Ollama), and it's open source. Jira integration coming soon.

This morning changed everything for my SaaS,"I know $100 MRR isn’t life-changing, but waking up and seeing that number today felt different*.*

Two months ago, Launchli was just a tiny project I hacked together at home, a full-stack distribution platform that learns your tone, creates content that sounds like you, schedules it across LinkedIn/X/Reddit, gives you SEO keywords you can rank for, and now even finds inbound leads by searching posts where people are talking about the problem your product solves.

Basically: I wanted something that would handle visibility so I could actually focus on building.

At the start, it was dead quiet.  
A few signups here and there.  
Lots of doubt.  
A whole lot of “why is nobody noticing this?”

But consistency really compounds. I kept posting small updates, showing the build, talking about lessons, and somehow that slow trickle of attention turned into users… and now paying customers.

Seeing $100 MRR for the first time hit way harder than I expected.  
Not because of the money, but because it’s the first time this feels like a real business with real momentum behind it.

If you’re building something right now and it feels like you’re shouting into the void: keep going.  
  
Momentum shows up quietly, then suddenly.

On to the next milestone. 🚀

Most founders don’t need a social media strategy. They need margin,"One thing I’ve learned in the last year of building:

Founders aren’t running out of ideas.

They’re running out of mental margin.

You spend your morning on customer calls, your afternoon solving bugs, your evening sending emails…

and then somewhere around 10 PM you remember you “still need to post everywhere.”

No wonder the majority of indie builders burn out before anything compounds.

Platforms want different things.

Instagram wants visuals, LinkedIn wants long thoughts, YouTube wants vertical cuts, Pinterest wants tall images.

Your brain is not designed to juggle 5 different content worlds at once.

I used to think the answer was a more complex content strategy.

But honestly?

The real answer was making the process *lighter*.

The reason I mention [OnlyTiming](http://onlytiming.com/) is because it was the first tool that removed the “platform-by-platform chaos” from my day. I upload once, adjust captions to match each platform’s personality, schedule…and that’s it. It’s not about growth hacks rather it just gives me breathing room.

Here’s what actually gives founders an advantage:

* reducing the decisions they make daily
* simplifying distribution
* keeping consistency low-effort
* not spending 10 hours a week posting manually
* eliminating the anxiety of “I missed today”

You don’t need to “be a content creator.”

You just need to show up consistently without blowing up your brain bandwidth.

When tools lighten the load, momentum becomes natural again.",rojal999,1pe4mws,SideProject,04-12-2025,17:35:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pe4mws/most_founders_dont_need_a_social_media_strategy/
A simple idea turned into the most motivating product I’ve made,"For the last months I’ve been working on a product that started as a small experiment and slowly turned into the most exciting thing I’ve ever built. It solves a problem I’ve felt for years: staying consistent with daily movement.  
Counting steps is boring. Streaks break. Motivation drops. The habit disappears.

The idea that finally made it “click” was surprisingly simple.  
Your real steps become progress along a real world journey.  
Not stats. Not gamified points. Actual movement along real routes with visuals and checkpoints.  
It changes the whole feeling of walking and running. Early testers keep saying the same thing: they walk more without forcing themselves.

I didn’t expect it, but the emotional response has been stronger than anything I’ve built before. People like seeing their progress unfold on something real, not just numbers on a screen.

The technical side was much harder than I thought. Mapping long routes, generating checkpoints, syncing steps across devices, making progress previews smooth, handling background updates. PostGIS and mobile sync gave me more edge cases than any SaaS project I’ve done. But the result feels worth it.

We’re getting closer to launch, and I opened a waitlist to let early users try it for free while we’re still shaping the product. No pressure to join. If it sounds interesting, feel free to take a look.

The Problem Every Founder Knows:

You build something. You're proud of it. You post on Twitter (12 likes, 3 bots). You post on LinkedIn (your mom commented). Crickets.

Product Hunt? Saturated.

Paid ads? Burned $500, got 2 signups.

I was ready to give up.  Then I Found FoundrList

Someone mentioned [foundrlist.com](http://foundrlist.com) \- a startup directory built for founders to get discovered.

I thought: ""Another directory? Sure, I'll add it to my list of 47 places nobody will see my product.""

Spoiler: I was completely wrong.



What Actually Happened:

Week 1:

Listed my SaaS (took 5 minutes)

Got a founder showcase page with proper SEO

Week 2:

127 profile views

43 clicks to my product

8 signups (better than my $500 ad spend)

Week 3:

Featured in ""Top Products""

Connected with 5+ indie hackers

Got feedback that improved my product

Why This Works:

✅ SEO-optimized - Shows up in Google

✅ Free to list - No $99/month BS

✅ Real community - Founders helping founders

✅ Fast & clean - Built with Next.js + Supabase

Will it make you a millionaire overnight? No.

"I kept forgetting my supplements during my weight loss journey, so I built an app for it — free premium if you want to try","Hey guys,



I wanted to share something I’ve been working on for the last months because it came directly from my own training routine.



I lost **45 kg** over the past couple of years, and along the way I started using a lot of daily supplements — creatine, vitamins, omega-3, etc. The annoying part was that I constantly forgot whether I took them or not. Some days I took stuff twice, some days not at all.

Hot take: Most AI video apps are scams… I built one (AutoAI Shorts) and figured out why.,"https://preview.redd.it/bgqcxzbe285g1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5fb638367d84c85c1e01e814767b7670fce95cf

I’m putting this out there because no one wants to say it.  
  
  
I’ve been developing an AI video generator app called AutoAI Shorts. It made about ₹8,000 this month, which is good, but here’s the hard truth:  
95% of AI video apps you find on the Play Store are all hype.  
  
  
They’re overpriced, unstable, and most developers have no idea what’s going on behind the scenes. I know this because the deeper I dig, the more broken the whole system appears.  
  
  
Examples:  
  
  
 Some apps charge ₹799 a month and only bundle 3 free APIs.  
 Many generate 20 images and only show you the best 2, hiding the bad ones.  
 Some apps use stolen models, and people don’t even notice.  
 Most “AI video makers” just stitch images, add text-to-speech, and put on subtitles, pretending it’s something special.  
  
  
Here’s the tough part…  
  
  
 Even my app, AutoAI Shorts, sometimes produces complete garbage.  
  
  
One video looks amazing. The next one appears like a bad dream. User ratings jump from “BRO THIS IS FIRE” to “WHY DOES MY FACE HAVE 9 TEETH??”  
  
  
I’m making a profit (₹500 for infrastructure + $27 for Replicate, leading to around ₹8k in revenue), but the quality fluctuates wildly.  
  
  
So yes, I understand why people label AI apps as scams. The technology is strong but unreliable. Many developers piece things together poorly.  
  
  
 Is anyone else working in this field and feeling the same way?  
  
  
How do you:  
  
  
 lower image generation costs  
 prevent users from flooding the system with 100 prompts  
 tackle the “AI mushy face” issue  
 keep videos consistent  
 convert free users to paid without overcharging like the sketchy apps do

I built a real-time architecture visualizer that generates and understands project context. Looking for feedback.,"I’ve been working on a tool that tries to solve a problem I constantly face: understanding the real context of a project.

Not tasks.  
Not roadmaps.  
Not generic diagrams.

I wanted to *see* the actual architecture as a living system: modules, state, connections, documentation, flow, stability and missing context.

Before anyone says “this already exists,” let me clarify: I'm not trying to replace task boards, dependency graphs or documentation generators. Those tools are great.  
I wanted something different and more visual.

Each feature in the project contains a small `.context.md` file that defines purpose, state, connections, tests, docs and rules.  
The app reads those files and turns them into an interactive map of nodes.  
When the server runs, the flow between modules is visualized in real time, so you can literally watch the system operate.  
Missing context, weak features or broken flows become immediately obvious.

Later, an AI agent (Veronica) will monitor the project, enforce architecture rules, detect inconsistencies and alert when something drifts or breaks.  
Not to generate code, but to understand it and maintain coherence across the entire system.

I built this in Electron simply because I wanted it fully local.  
I had never touched Electron before, but strong fundamentals helped, and I put together this first version in about 2 days.

This is not a product launch.  
I’ll probably keep it free, and if it becomes stable, I may open-source it so others can build on top of it.

Here’s a short demo video.  
Any feedback is welcome.",edinsonjohender,1pe5izo,SideProject,04-12-2025,18:09:02,https://v.redd.it/crqzhpeyy75g1
How do people really see you online?,"I built a little side project because I got tired of guessing how I look online
and it turns out other people struggle with the same thing.

As a founder I’m constantly in situations where people check me online before we ever speak
customers investors recruiters all of them form an opinion based on whatever they find.
And honestly I never had a clear picture of what that opinion actually is.

So I built Brand-Stat a tool that scans your online presence and shows you how you come across
what signals help you what signals hurt you and what you can improve.
It started as something I built for myself but once I showed it to a few friends
I realized everyone has the same blind spot.
We think we know our online reputation but we actually really don’t.

I’m sharing it here because I’d love feedback from people who care about personal branding hiring or founder reputation.
It’s still early and I’m figuring out what matters most to users.

Will Apple ever copy this? I made a Mac command bar that lets you work with your files using natural language,"Hey folks,

I’m mostly an indie game developer (I co-founded a little company called [inkle](https://www.inklestudios.com). We made [80 Days](https://www.inklestudios.com/80days), [Heaven’s Vault](https://www.inklestudios.com/heavensvault), [Overboard!](https://www.inklestudios.com/overboard) and [A Highland Song](https://www.inklestudios.com/ahighlandsong)). Making tools is my idea of a relaxing hobby which probably says something worrying about me, but anyway… here’s my latest side project.

It’s called [Substage](https://substage.app). It’s a thin bar that sits just under Finder and turns plain English into Terminal commands. I feel like sometimes I want to just type what I want (without having to know the exact right terminal command) and for the right thing to happen with my files.

A few things you can ask it:

* “convert these to jpg”
* “make a gif from this video”
* “extract the 3rd page of this PDF”
* “select all PNGs”
* “resize these to 1080p”
* “download this link to here”
* “turn this markdown file into a PDF”
* “zip these up and put the result in a new folder”
* “crop this image by 50 pixels each side”
* “overlay a watermark that says Best Kitty”
* “compress this PDF”
* “merge these PDFs into one file”
* “extract text from all of these”

Substage writes the Terminal command, shows you what it’s about to do, then runs it for you. It also has a history so you can reuse commands instantly for repeat jobs.

The thing I find it most useful for is media and asset-related stuff when developing games: for example when working on trailers, screenshots etc, there are always lots of files flying around in different formats, and Substage is great for doing quick batch resizing, format changes, zipping stuff up etc.

If this sounds useful, you can [try it free here](https://substage.app). If it doesn't sound useful, I'll get back to my day job of making games 😅",joethephish,1pe8ws7,SideProject,04-12-2025,20:12:25,https://v.redd.it/dbbq6fxrj85g1
I built an AI book scanner to actually remember what I read (JacketJot – looking for feedback),"Hey everyone 👋

I’m a solo indie dev and just shipped a side project I’ve been obsessing over for a while: **JacketJot – AI Book Scanner**.

The problem I kept running into:  
I’d read a ton of non-fiction, feel super inspired for a day or two… and then forget 90% of it. My shelves looked impressive, but my *actual* recall and implementation were pretty weak.

So I built something for myself first:

# 🧠 What JacketJot does

The core flow:

1. **Snap a book cover** or an **ISBN**
2. JacketJot identifies the book
3. It generates an **AI summary + key points + takeaways**
4. You save it into a **smart library** with *To Read / Reading / Completed* shelves
5. For some books, you can go deeper with **mini courses, flashcards, quizzes, and spaced review prompts**

The goal is to treat each book like a tiny “course” instead of a one-time dopamine hit.

# 📚 Main features

* AI-powered summaries & key ideas
* Smart library with *To Read / Reading / Completed*
* Barcode & ISBN scanning
* Read Aloud, “Explain Simpler”, and a dyslexia-friendly font
* Optional study tools:
   * per-book mini course
   * flashcards & quiz generator
   * basic spaced repetition / review prompts
* Sync across devices

I built the whole thing for iOS and just got it approved on the App Store. Coming soon to Android Play Store

# 💸 Monetization

* Free download
* Paid tiers (Premium / Student / Ultimate) that unlock:
   * AI Reading Assistant
   * deeper study tools (flashcards, mini course per book, quizzes, knowledge map)
   * more daily scans

No ads. Just subscriptions.

# 🛠 Build notes (for fellow builders)

* 100% built using AI-assisted tooling (Lovable) + manual iteration
* Integrates with in-app purchases via RevenueCat / App Store subscriptions
* Lots of time went into:
   * making scan → summary feel fast
   * avoiding “AI wall of text” and instead nudging people into **takeaways + actions**

Happy to share more technical details if anyone’s curious.

# 🙏 What I’d love feedback on

If you’re into reading / studying and feel like kicking the tires, I’d really appreciate:

1. **Onboarding:**
   * Does it make sense what the app does within the first minute?
2. **Scan → summary → save flow:**
   * Anything confusing or annoying in that core loop?
3. **Positioning / pricing:**
   * Does the free vs paid split feel reasonable, or does something feel off?

"I built a side project to manage my side projects😂😂😂, thanks to codex and claude code!","
Hey 👋 

Quick share - just shipped [MyBacklinks.app](https://mybacklinks.app) after 1 month of solo building.

I had 10+ side projects, backlinks in messy spreadsheets, domains I kept forgetting to renew, analytics scattered across GA4/GSC/Plausible. Chaos.🥲🥲

So, the solution: One dashboard to manage it all.🤔


How I built it:

- Codex + Claude Code for 80% of the coding
- Gemini 3.0 pro for UI design (no Figma, just conversations)
- Cloudflare Workers instead of Vercel (tired of surprise bills)

Total hosting cost: ~$5/mo. No VC money.


What it does:

- Track backlinks across all your projects
- Connect GA4/GSC/Plausible in one place
- Connect to Stripe and Adsense for revenue update
- Domain expiry reminders
- AI competitor backlink discovery

I quit my job and spent 2 months building an 80+ page D&D Christmas Horror adventure... and I finally launched it.,"For the past couple of months, I’ve been waking up at 7 AM, making peppermint mocha coffee, and spending every free hour writing, editing, designing, and obsessing over a D&D adventure that started as a fun idea… and became a *massive* winter project.

* 80+ written pages
* 12 maps
* 12 handouts
* custom stat blocks
* original mechanics
* an emotional storyline I didn’t expect to care this much about
* a surprisingly dark Christmas theme I’m still not sure how I created

Hide notifications + sensitive app windows during screen sharing — while still using them normally,"Hi everyone,

I built a macOS app that solves something I’ve always struggled with during Zoom/Teams/Meet calls:

how to share my screen *without* exposing personal apps, private windows, or unexpected notifications.

The app creates a **mirrored window** of your main screen.

That mirrored window is what you share — and it automatically **excludes**:

* Any app windows you choose to hide (you can still see and interact with them normally)
* All notification banners (you can still see and interact with them normally)
* Full Notification Center (you can still see and interact with them normally)

It looks like your real desktop to viewers, but keeps your actual desktop fully usable and private.

Some key features:

* **Selective window hiding:** Hide any app/window from the mirrored view without affecting how you use it.
* **Notification & Notification Center hiding:** View them normally yourself, but they stay invisible to viewers.
* **Presets:** Create quick toggle groups for recurring meetings.
* **Multi-display support:** Place the mirrored window full-screen on any external monitor or AirPlay display.
* **Free to download right now.**

[Side Project] I Built AutoReply Pro+ — A Smart WhatsApp Auto-Responder for Small Businesses & Busy People,"Hey r/SideProject 👋,

I’ve been building a tool over the last few weeks that came from a very real, very common problem I kept seeing… especially among small business owners and freelancers around me.

People rely heavily on WhatsApp for work, but they miss messages all the time — during meetings, while driving, late night, or when life is just happening.  
Those missed messages often mean **missed leads, delayed support, or lost opportunities.**

So I decided to build something to solve that problem in the simplest, most accessible way I could.

This turned into my side project: **AutoReply Pro+**.

# 🌱 How the Idea Started

I kept running into situations like:

* A shop owner losing sales because he couldn’t reply fast enough
* Coaches & service providers missing queries after posting ads
* Delivery partners getting overloaded with repeated questions
* Freelancers juggling multiple clients and blowing response times

Everyone wanted a way to “just reply automatically” without buying tools, learning APIs, or using WhatsApp Business API (which most people avoid).

That was the seed.

# 🧩 The Core Problem I Wanted to Solve

Most WhatsApp automation tools fall into two extremes:

1. **Too basic** — simple autoresponders, no logic
2. **Too complex** — API-based, requires dashboards, subscriptions, and configuration

There was **nothing powerful + simple** for normal Android users.

So the challenge became:  
**Can I build a smart automation engine that runs locally on Android, with zero technical setup?**

# 🚧 The Build Journey (the fun + painful parts)

# 1. Accessibility + Notification Listener juggling

Building reliable automation on top of WhatsApp without official APIs was tricky.  
Early versions broke randomly on MIUI, ColorOS, and Samsung ROMs.  
I rewrote the message-parsing pipeline 3 times.

# 2. Creating a Rule Engine

I wanted users to define behavior like:

    If message contains ""price"" → send pricing  
    If message contains ""hi"" → send greeting  
    If non-contact → send welcome message  
    If repeated message → use cooldown  
    

I ended up designing a lightweight JSON rule interpreter.  
It’s tiny, fast, and now powers all automation.

# 3. Adding AI Replies

I didn’t want full AI conversation or chatbot complexity.  
Just *context-aware replies that sound human*.  
A few prototypes later, the AI module became optional — users can enable or disable it per profile.

# 4. UX Simplification

My first UI looked like a debugging tool 😅  
Testers told me it was powerful but intimidating.  
So I redesigned:

* onboarding → 3 steps
* rule creation → minimal screens
* profiles → visual & plug-and-play

Now even non-tech users can set it up in minutes.

# 🔧 What AutoReply Pro+ Does Now

* Custom **rule-based auto replies**
* **AI-powered** smart replies (optional)
* **Welcome messages**
* **Multiple profiles** (Business hours, Weekend, Personal, etc.)
* **Filters:** groups, contacts, delay, cooldown
* Works on **WhatsApp & WhatsApp Business**
* No API, no server, no root — runs fully on Android

It’s simple on the surface, but has real automation power underneath.

# 🆕 Recent Improvements

* Faster message matching
* Better battery efficiency
* Improved Accessibility reliability
* Per-contact custom replies
* Cleaner onboarding

# 💬 What I’d Love Feedback On

Since r/SideProject has a strong builder/dev mindset, I'd love thoughts on:

* Rule engine design
* UI flow (too simple? too complex?)
* Onboarding
* Naming & branding
* Any features you believe would make it *10× more useful*
* Pricing thoughts (still figuring this out)

Even blunt criticism is welcome — it helps me improve faster.

# 🙏 Final Thoughts

This has been one of my most challenging but rewarding side projects.  
Seeing small businesses actually use it and save time has been the best part.

If you give it a try, I’d be grateful for any feedback.

"Splitting Xcode logs into 5+ real-time lanes changed how I debug. So I built a tool for it, and added MCP bridge, so Cursor knows exactly what to look for while debugging with me","Xcode’s single log stream made debugging a memory leak on older devices almost impossible.

Image caching, rendering, system messages, and errors were all mixed together.

So I built a multi-lane log viewer for macOS to separate memory, rendering, network, system, and error logs in real time.

But the real breakthrough came later.

I added MCP support for Cursor.

Each lane became an isolated context the model could query independently.

Suddenly Cursor could explain what was happening across lanes with actual accuracy instead of getting confused from one giant blob.

I built a Chrome extension that adds historical engagement stats to Reddit user popovers,"Hey everyone! This is a small project I’ve been working on that might I hope is useful to other Reddit users.

I built a Chrome extension that adds a little bit of context to Reddit’s user popovers (i.e., the box that appears when you click on a comment author's username). When you click on someone, the extension shows the top subreddits they’ve posted in over the past year — all based on publicly available Reddit activity.

The goal is just to give readers a bit more context to help them understand where users are coming from, and to give users another way to discover new subreddits. (My favorite find so far: r/CannedSardines. Reddit is a weird and wonderful place.)

A couple notes:

* It only sends the \*clicked\* username to my API (not your username or browsing data)
* It excludes NSFW and sensitive categories to maintain privacy
* It doesn’t store anything about the person using the extension
* Everything shown is derived from public Reddit posts/comments
* It just plugs into the existing popover and adds a small horizontal bar chart

I'm a GenAI engineer by trade. While looking at the job market trends, I realized most Resume Checkers are either expensive or lock basic features behind a paywall.

So, I spent my weekends building AtsGrade , a tool that simulates how ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) read your resume.

I doubled my daily registered user by add Google and Apple login,"For over a year now, I’ve been building my app for laptop friendly cafés, but only about two weeks ago, I implemented Google and Apple login.

This tiny feature has already boosted my daily sign ups. To be honest, before I added it, I got 0–1 new registered users a day. Now I get 2–3. Technically, that’s double. 😄

Jokes aside, I really recommend implementing it early in the building process, or even making sign up Google and Apple only. Sometimes that’s the best way.  
People are lazy. Nobody wants to create yet another account anymore. They want a one-click solution.

I started a research-based Substack exploring “Culinary Intelligence” — using data + systems thinking to reinvent how we understand food,"I’ve been working on a side project I’m calling **The Culinary Intelligence Project** — a long-term attempt to rethink how we understand food, ingredients, and cooking through a more scientific + systems-based lens.

I’m exploring things like:

* how ingredients *actually* interact (chemistry, nutrients, volatiles)
* how to optimize food combinations for taste + nutrition
* ways to reduce waste through smarter pairing logic
* whether you can build a structured “culinary ontology”
* how global cuisines can be mapped as data networks
* how food choices change when you analyze them like a system instead of a recipe

I’m a web/mobile dev with a new idea every day and I've been working past weeks on a tool called **Le Scribe**.

The problem I had with existing AI meeting tools is that they just dump a wall of text or a boring bullet list. Plus they are often heavy to use or to parameter. I wanted something that felt official and readable, like a well-formatted newspaper or a corporate memo.

**What it does:**

* It captures audio from your browser tab (Meet, Zoom, Teams) and/or microphone.
* It uses Gemini 2.5 Flash to transcribe and summarize.
* **The cool part:** It renders the HTML to look like actual paper/ink documents. You can even upload a PDF, and the AI tries to mimic its visual style for the report.

I wanted a simple tool, and able to work with every meeting tools. And you can even using it during your physical meetings with the record option.

I built a cozy personal library app over the past few months - and I just got my first paid customer.,"I'm a huge book nerd and collector but big time prefer physical books.  I wanted an App that could give me exactly what I wanted the way I wanted it...(Things like when you're standing in a used book store wondering 'do I already own this?' or 'who the heck did I lend that too again?'   

There are good book apps out there for sure - Goodreads,  Notion, even a spreadsheet....maybe the spreadsheets aren't very cozy but...😅 

So I built a little private web app for myself where I can track my physical collection, see where everything is (loaned out, shelves), get simple reading stats, search/filter quickly, share a read-only version with friends (people are loving this feature I think it's what got me my first paid customer!!!), and customize it with cozy themes - even a Christmas one!

It started small and grew piece by piece. Some friends knew I was working on it and ended up wanting to use it...and they had some really great ideas to expand it....it just kept snowballing....

I was excited when the app sold last night and I wanted to share but my family is tired of listening to me go on about it lol!

A couple years ago I shut down my liquidation store and ended up stuck with about 3,500 different SKUs. I turned to eBay thinking I’d knock them out fast, but I was only listing 40–50 items a day and constantly losing track of my own inventory. I kept misplacing items, forgetting what was listed, guessing on prices, and spending way too much time searching for things I had already photographed. Out of frustration, I started building a tool just to help myself with faster listing creation, product research and comps, a full barcode and SKU system so I’d stop losing items, and inventory tracking that actually works for high-volume sellers. Halfway through I realized I wasn’t the only reseller dealing with this chaos, so I just kept going.

I built a cron monitoring SaaS to stop losing sleep over failed backup jobs,"Hey r/SideProject! 👋
I just launched CronMonitor - a monitoring service for cron jobs and scheduled tasks. After too many nights discovering failed backups the morning after, I decided to build something to actually alert me when things break.
The Problem
I run a few SaaS apps and like many of you, I rely heavily on cron jobs for:
Database backups
Data cleanup tasks
Report generation
API syncs
Email campaigns
The issue? Cron jobs fail silently. You only find out something broke when a customer complains, or worse - when you need that backup that never ran.
What I Built
CronMonitor is dead simple:
Create a monitor with your expected schedule
Add one curl command to your cron job
Get alerted immediately when something doesn't run
Features:
⏰ Timezone-aware scheduling (UTC? Local time? No problem)
📧 Email + Webhook alerts (Slack/Discord coming soon)
📊 Execution history & analytics
🔒 Grace periods for jobs that might run a bit late
🌍 Multi-timezone support for international teams

What's Next:
SMS alerts
Rest API
Export data ex. CSV
modern nice ux

Why I'm Sharing
I'm at that scary point where I've built something I personally use every day, but I have no idea if anyone else will find it useful. Would love to hear:
Is this a problem you face?
What's missing from my feature list?
Would you actually pay for this?

As a side project I've built a webapp which help to track and manage your subscriptions. It is focused on preventing you from paying for expensive (yearly) subscriptions that you don't use anymore and forgot about. Which happened to myself several times😅.

I figured a spreadsheet wasn't cutting it, so I built a tool focused purely on preventing losing money.

It's called [SubAlert.app](http://subalert.app/)

**How SubAlert works**

* **Automated Import:** Securely connect to your bank account to automatically find and import **all** your recurring payments (no manual effort needed!).
* **Renewal Notifications:** Get timely alerts before upcoming payments (especially those annual ones which you forgot about!) so you can cancel in time.
* **Clear Overview:** See all your subscriptions, their due dates, and your total monthly/annual spending in one clean dashboard.
* **Spending Analytics:** Get quick insights into where your money is going and see your projected annual cost.

**Looking for Feedback**

Since this is built for developers and mindful users, I'm really keen to get your critical feedback on the UI/UX, the overall value proposition, and any features you think are absolutely essential. If you send me a DM I can give you a promo code for an extended pro/premium tier period.

• Growing library of discoverable items  
• Instant visual feedback when a new combo works  
• Progress is saved automatically  
• Zero learning curve—just tap, try, see what happens

Looking for advice: when do you decide to go mobile vs. double-down on web?,"I’m building a tool that helps people build simple habits around nurturing their relationships. Early traction has been great. Lots of sign-ups, strong emotional resonance with the idea, but I'm self critical because sign-ups aren’t the same as people coming back. Retention is where I’m stuck.

I’m torn.

**On one hand:**  
Mobile feels like the natural end state. Push notifications, tighter loops, Widgets, and a spot on the home screen all seem important for something that’s about ongoing habits.

**On the other hand:**  
There’s real cost. Time, complexity, slower iteration, and a tougher distribution funnel. Asking someone to download an app this early might kill the learning cycle. If I can solve retention on the web alone, that feels like the purest form of validation... almost a stress test of the idea itself.

For folks who’ve been here before:

* How did you think about timing your mobile build?
* Did you try to push web as far as possible first?
* Are there frameworks or heuristics you used to decide?
* If you cracked retention on web, did it transfer cleanly to mobile later?

I’m a software engineer with \~10 years of experience in localization platforms, and I’ve been building a tool on the side called [PolyGrid](https://usepolygrid.com)**,** an online Excel ↔ XLIFF round-trip converter for localization teams. It started as a personal frustration with broken filters and messy spreadsheet workflows, and I’m now trying to turn it into a polished product.

**What it does:**

* Supports XLIFF 1.2 & 2.1 (exports work in any CAT tool)
* Built-in segmentation + custom SRX
* Multilingual spreadsheet support
* Auto-detects source/target languages from headers with good accuracy
* Handles complex HTML
* Import/export configs in JSON or YAML
* Preserves formatting & formulas; supports comments; can include/exclude hidden rows/cols; skip cells by color; handles merged cells
* Merge translations back into Excel in one go (bulk upload XLIFFs)
* MT prefill via DeepL or Google (Pro+)
* Google Sheets Add-On
* API access for advanced users
* No file storage, everything processed in memory and discarded

It’s free to try anonymously. If you sign up or subscribe, you get higher limits.

I’d really appreciate feedback on:

* **Pricing** (are the tiers reasonable? anything missing?)
* **Landing page clarity** (does the value proposition make sense quickly?)
* **Feature gaps** (what would make this more “must-have”?)
* **Any UX issues** you notice while trying it out

"I built an AI “longevity coach” that combines facial scans, wearables and blood tests - looking for feedback","I’ve been working on a project called **Aion™** and I’d really appreciate some honest feedback from this community.

**Background / problem**

In my 30s I started to feel my energy, focus and drive slip, even though I was already tracking sleep, workouts and HRV with wearables. I had data scattered across Whoop/Oura/Apple Health and blood tests, but very little clarity on what to actually change day to day.

**What Aion does**

Aion tries to turn all of that into simple daily actions by combining:

* AI facial scans from your phone (stress, fatigue, recovery signals)
* Wearable data (Whoop / Oura / Apple Health: sleep, HRV, strain, etc.)
* Blood test analysis (hormones and key longevity markers)

The goal is to provide:

* A clear view of how your hormones, sleep, mood and recovery are trending over time
* Simple “do this today” suggestions (bedtime, caffeine timing, training intensity, light exposure, etc.)
* A way to see how things like testosterone and other longevity-related markers change as you tweak habits

There is a **7-day free trial** live so you can see it with your own data. Link is here: [app.aionlongevity.com](http://app.aionlongevity.com)

**What I’d like feedback on**

* Does this solve a real problem you have, or does it feel like “just another dashboard”?
* What would make you actually keep using something like this beyond the first week?
* If you do try the trial: how was onboarding, clarity of the recommendations, general UX?

Aion is meant to sit on top of the tools and tests you already use and make the data more understandable and actionable.

"Loopi: Open-Source Visual Browser Automation Tool (MIT Licensed, v1.0.0 Released)","Hi community,

I've been working on a tool that might fit into the automation space for browser tasks, and I'd love to hear your thoughts as an open-source project. Loopi is a desktop app that lets you build browser automations visually, using a graph-based editor—think drag-and-drop nodes powered by local Puppeteer runs.

**Key features:**

* Drag-and-drop workflow builder for browser actions (inspired by tools like n8n, but tailored for web automation)
* Runs everything locally in Chromium—no cloud or external services needed
* Supports data extraction, variables, conditionals, and loops
* Aimed at simplifying repetitive web tasks without writing code

It's built with Electron, React, TypeScript, Puppeteer, and ReactFlow, and is fully open source under the MIT license.

This is early days (v1.0.0 just dropped), so expect some rough edges—docs are basic, and I'm iterating based on real feedback. If you've used Selenium, Playwright, or similar for testing/scraping, does a visual approach like this solve any pain points for you?

**Example workflow:** Pulling prices from multiple product pages, filtering for deals under $50, then screenshotting matches—all via nodes, no scripting.

WinTrayMemory -,"**Hi everyone!**

I’d like to share my new pet project WinTrayMemory \- a lightweight yet powerful heavy‑process monitor and RAM cleaner for Windows that lives quietly in the system tray and stays out of your way. It tracks the most memory‑hungry processes in real time and safely frees RAM using native Windows APIs.

**What WinTrayMemory does (short):**

\- 📊 Monitors RAM usage and the heaviest processes in real time.  
\- 🔢 Shows status directly in the system tray via icon and tooltip.  
\- 🧹 Can gently free memory without killing your system.  
\- 🧩 Built with C# + WPF focusing on clean, maintainable code (MVVM, separated layers, settings, etc.).

The project is under active development: features, the user interface, the solution structure, and the code quality are being improved. The goal is to keep it running and evolving, so any ideas, issue reports, or improvements are greatly appreciated. And frankly, **GitHub stars are a huge incentive for further development.**

**Key settings:**

|Setting|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Process types|Opens the config where you define Safely / Warning / Dangerous apps and their tray categories.|
|Min heavy process size|Sets the minimum RAM (MB) for a process to count as “heavy” in the Heaviest Processes list.|
|Max processes shown|Limits how many top heavy processes are shown at once to keep the list readable.|
|Refresh interval|Controls how often processes and memory stats are refreshed (in seconds).|

**Cleaning options **

Frees memory using documented Windows APIs (such as EmptyWorkingSet and NtSetSystemInformation) instead of shady registry tweaks or “magic boosters”.

|Option|Requirements|
|:-|:-|
|*Trim process working sets*|Administrator|
|*Purge low‑priority standby list*|SYSTEM level|
|*Purge full standby list*|SYSTEM level|
|*Purge modified page list*|SYSTEM level|

"Non-coder here. I used AI to build a ""Shock Absorber"" script for cloud servers. Is this concept valid?","Hi everyone,
I’m not a developer (I can’t write syntax), but I have a background in systems thinking. I used AI to help me code a logic kernel to solve a specific inefficiency I noticed in cloud infrastructure.

The Problem:
Cloud autoscalers (the things that add more servers when traffic goes up) often ""flap"" or oscillate. They react to a sudden spike in CPU, scale up, realize the spike was just noise, and scale down. This wastes money and computing power.

The Project:
Instead of using standard static thresholds (if Load > 80%), I designed a local Python script that gives the system ""Inertia.""
Weighted Memory: It forces the system to look at the history of the load, not just the current second.
Dynamic Resistance: It changes how fast it reacts based on the stability of the hardware (e.g., RAM usage). If the system is stable, it ignores small spikes. If it's unstable, it reacts faster.

The Result:
I have a prototype running locally (it's a side-load script, not a SaaS) that successfully smooths out the ""jitters"" in simulated traffic logs without crashing during real load.

As I've never attempted anything like this, I'd really appreciate some feedback/thoughts on this ",Clumsy_ninja737,1pee5go,SideProject,04-12-2025,23:38:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pee5go/noncoder_here_i_used_ai_to_build_a_shock_absorber/

I built 3terna. A digital estate planning tool for people who don't want to think about death (but should),"After 3+ months of solo development, I finally launched my first SaaS!

3terna helps people organize their digital legacy, the stuff that falls through the cracks even if you have a will.

**What users can do:**

* **Video messages** \- Record final messages for loved ones with a built-in teleprompter so you don't forget what to say and you can stare at the camera
* **Digital asset vault** \- Store account credentials, documents, instructions for each recipient
* **Physical item assignment** \- Decide who gets what and leave notes explaining why
* **Multiple recipients** \- Different people can receive different things

**How delivery works:**

Users set a check-in schedule (weekly, monthly, custom, etc.). If they stop checking in, the system waits through a grace period (that you can set), then automatically delivers everything to the designated recipients. No third party needed, no lawyer involved.

**Privacy:** Everything is encrypted and stored securely in CloudFlare R2.

I have zero access to user content! I couldn't see your data even if I wanted to lol

**Tech stack:** React, TypeScript, Supabase, Vercel, SendGrid

**Pricing:** $9/mo basic, $19/mo premium, $39/mo family

Would love feedback from other builders - especially on UX and the onboarding flow.

"As a post-exit founder that is now mentoring other founders, I am starting to see why startups die.","No one tells you this, but startups rarely die from competition. They die from exhaustion and arguments.  
  
When I was a first-time founder back in 2014, I got incredibly lucky to find a co-founder that became my best friend. That bond allowed us to get through all of the hard times without falling apart, even through our exit and now into our new company.  
  
**Pick people you can suffer with**  
Co-founders aren’t just about skills, they’re about finding people who can lift you up when you are down. You’ll spend more time with them than your own family. Choose people who still show up when everything sucks.  
  
**Work-life “balance” is fake if you are a founder**  
But, you still need recovery time. Build habits to recharge fast. Gym, walks, game nights, whatever stops your brain from melting.  
  
**Determination > motivation**  
Motivation fades. You need to still get up in the morning even when you have no motivation. Build up your determination instead and be consistent. Set your bar so that you can always keep moving, even on bad days.

"I was tired of messing around with PowerPoint slides, so I built a tool to make the process faster","I’ve been working on a small tool over the last year because I constantly found myself wasting time managing and recreating the same PowerPoint slides just different. I build a lot of decks for work, and the process always felt more chaotic than it should be: copy/pasting old slides, tweaking layouts, fixing formatting over and over… you know the pain.

So I ended up building something for myself, and it slowly turned into a proper little project: Fast Slides.

The idea is pretty simple: I wanted a faster way to create a presentation, create the initial slides, and keep everything editable in PowerPoint without weird locked elements or autogenerated junk. Basically a workflow that saves time but still gives full control in the end.

It’s still evolving, so I’d really appreciate some honest feedback:

* Does the general workflow make sense?
* Is there even a place for something like this in the age of AI?
* Anything confusing or missing?
* If you regularly build presentations, would this help you — or not really?

I’m not trying to sell anything here; I mainly want to understand if the idea is useful beyond my own use case.  
Thanks to anyone who takes a look, and I’m happy to answer any questions!

PS: Yes there is also an option to make the slide selection full screen in PowerPoint, you\`re not stuck to the little screen on the right.

"Image generators kept breaking my focus, so I built my own tool - looking for honest feedback.","I've been generating images for months and kept running into the same friction points that pulled me out of my creative flow. So, I built something to fix it for myself.

Took about three months. It's rough, but it works. Now I'm trying to figure out if these problems are just me being picky, or if other people deal with this too.

**The stuff that was driving me crazy:**

Checking details meant opening new tabs, fighting browser scrollbars, or downloading to Photoshop just to see if something looked right at full resolution.

Finding previous images to iterate on meant endless scrolling or squinting at tiny thumbnails. 20 minutes of generation and I couldn't find the one I wanted.

UI clutter everywhere. Panels, toolbars, settings - all fighting for screen space when I just wanted to look at the image.

**What I built (PixelPilot):**

Full-screen canvas with intuitive zoom controls. One-click 100% zoom or smooth keyboard/mouse navigation to any area.

Every image saves to a ""living history"" - arrow keys to navigate through past versions instantly, allowing instant full screen views in the canvas.

On-demand tools allow keyboard shortcuts to access the tools only when you need them.  Or you can pin them and the tools fade to semi-transparent when you're not using them. You see the full image but everything's still accessible. 

**The ask:**

Right now, this runs locally. I'm willing to build out the backend to make it public, but only if these pain points actually resonate with people.

I set up a waitlist as a voting mechanism - if enough people sign up, I'll know it's worth the engineering effort.

I built a side project to shrink document review from days → hours. Brutal feedback welcome.,"https://reddit.com/link/1pef84s/video/m2zo8shju95g1/player

  
  
Most of the “non-technical office work” that eats entire days is just…moving information from documents into columns. Think recruiting teams dragging PDFs into an ATS and copy‑pasting resumes into spreadsheets, or underwriters combing through 50+ pages just to fill a few fields.

Watching a few teams work, the pattern was the same every time:

\* Huge piles of PDFs, PPTs, and docs coming in from everywhere.

\* Everyone building their own spreadsheets to “organize” things.

\* Hours lost to manual review and copy‑paste, even when they were already using AI somewhere else.

I have been working on a small tool to automate that middle layer instead of asking people to change their whole stack:

\* You drag in any number of files (PDFs, PowerPoints, etc.) and everything stays local on your machine by design, so nothing leaves your system.

\* You create whatever columns you care about (e.g. “Years of experience”, “Tech stack”, “Credit score”, “Debt‑to‑income ratio”) and the app maps data from each document into those columns.

\* There’s an AI assist that suggests useful columns and what to extract based on the documents you’ve uploaded, so you don’t have to engineer prompts or write rules.

\* For one recruiting team, this cut their manual screening time by \\\~90%. For one underwriting workflow, it turned a 3‑day review cycle into roughly 8–9 hours.

It’s not trying to be an ATS or LOS; it’s more like “Cursor, but for non‑technical back‑office work where everything lives in PDFs and random files.” The focus is:

\* No infra to manage.

\* No data leaving your machine.

\* Make it trivial to go from “pile of documents” to “structured table I can filter/sort/use in existing tools.”

If anyone here:

\* Handles high‑volume resume or application review.

\* Does underwriting / compliance checks from document packs.

\* Or has a similar document‑heavy workflow they’d like to shrink from days to hours…

I would love feedback from this crowd on what’s missing, what would break in your environment, or where you’d draw the line on “too much automation” vs “still want a human in the loop.”

My first ever data (and NBA) project!,"Hi everyone!

I wanted to share a small accomplishment that made me really happy this week.

I'm a brazilian journalist. Recently I've become really interested in data analysis. Making that transition is pretty tough, but this week I finally built my first real data project (and I even combined it with something I love: basketball!)

The project is simple, but I’m excited about it! Basically, I analyze a player's statline from a game (points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks) and check whether that exact combination has ever happened before in NBA history, or if it's completely new.
If it has happened, the program also finds how many times and when the earliest occurrence was.

I’d be really happy if you checked it out and followed the project if you find it interesting!

Solo founder building an AI art marketplace on nights & weekends | looking for honest feedback & a few testers,"Hello everybody, I’m a solo founder from Germany, working since January this year building an AI art marketplace called: ""Lux et Ars"", usually working in the evening or night on it.

Prepare for a lot of text.

TLDR summary;  
Lux et Ars **= curated AI art marketplace + fine-art physical prints with licenses/certificates/hologram + auctions.**  
AI artists upload, collectors can buy high quality prints (museum-grade paper, proper color management, tracked shipping, etc.), plus tools around bidding, pricing and fulfillment.



# Why I’m doing this

Over the last years I fell pretty deep into AI art. What bothered me...:Most AI art lives and dies on social media! The few marketplaces that exist often feel either:

\- super generic “print on demand” (zero curation, everything looks like clipart), or

\- closed ecosystems that don’t really care about the artist’s long-term brand.

\- low quality and mass produced slop

\- Only NFT based and too much concentrated on Crypto



I wanted a place that treats AI art more like *fine art* than “random images generated with a model”, including:

\- serious print quality (Hahnemühle etc.), with the highest standards of physical quality and durability 

\- transparent costs (print, shipping, fees),

\- a brand that doesn’t feel scammy or low-effort.

\- Premium / Luxury Vibe

So I started building. At the beginning I honestly underestimated how much work it is to go from “cool idea” to secure, production-ready marketplace where real money and physical items move around. But with the modern tools of LLMS (AI) and Coding Agents my productivity sky rocketed. 

First half year of development only used different models from OpenAi like o1, o3, 4.1 was really good. Sometimes Google Gemini was able to help me with a solution when OpenAI's Models couldn't fix it. Even tried Claude Code which was super helpful for developing and finishing the current 3D Gallery. But switched back to OpenAI's Model as Mainsource. Breakthrough was when Codex was thrown on the market by OpenAI. Really love that model to this day. Absolutely mindblown technology when you know how to use it.

Another thing that really motivated me was my curiosity about how well software can actually be developed using AI at this point. When will there be problems that can no longer be solved? How far can it go? That was another important challenge that taught me a lot over the last few months. I learned a great deal.



# What I’ve actually built so far

\- Backend: Python

\- Frontend: HTML + TailwindCSS

\- Auth, subscriptions, payouts: Stripe (Stripe Connect for creator payouts)

**Features:** 

Artist profiles & artwork uploads

Fixed-price listings + auction mode (with anti-sniping logic)

Multi-tier model (free & paid tiers with different commissions/limits)

Order flow for physical prints (including shipment creation / tracking in the backend)

Basic analytics and event tracking hooked up

It started as “let me quickly hack together a gallery"" and somehow turned into a full SaaS product with subscriptions, payouts, shipping labels and a very opinionated niche.

I’m still the only person touching the code, infra, copy, UI, everything.

# Where I’m at mentally

Right now I’m in that classic phase....Product works and it’s online, but I’m not sure if I’m early, wrong, or just quiet. I know there are a lot of AI artists out there, and I know there are collectors who like premium prints. What I don’t know yet is:

Is the positioning clear enough? (AI art, but for serious prints & collectors)

Are my flows (onboarding, upload, listing, checkout) understandable for someone who is *not* me?

Are my plans/commissions sane, or do they look like a cash grab to a new artist?

This is where I’d love some outside brains.



# What I’m looking for

**AI artists and people who play with image models**

\- Try to imagine you want to actually sell your best pieces as real prints.

\- Does my concept make sense?

\- Would you trust a niche marketplace like this or just stick to Etsy/Printful/etc....?

**SaaS folks who enjoy breaking products**

\- Click through onboarding, pretend you’re an artist or buyer.

\- Where do you get confused?

\- What feels slow, overcomplicated, or “I don’t want to give you this information yet”?

**High-level feedback**

\- Is this a viable niche SaaS in your eyes?

\- If you were me, how would you go from quiet beta to first 50–100 active artists without burning out on social media?

# How to check it out

If you do take a look and run into anything weird, confusing or just ugly, I’d genuinely appreciate a brutally honest comment or DM. I’m okay with negative feedback – “this screen sucks” is more useful to me than polite silence.

I am a LazyFck but I listed to your feedback..,"well 3 Months ago, I posted a rough prototype of my app that I was working on and I got roasted badly for counting my terrible pushups as valid reps.  You guys were right.  My form was fckall..  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1mzpg7f/i\_am\_a\_lazyfck\_so\_i\_built\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1mzpg7f/i_am_a_lazyfck_so_i_built_this/) and [https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1mz5lg6/i\_am\_a\_lazyfck\_so\_i\_am\_building\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1mz5lg6/i_am_a_lazyfck_so_i_am_building_this/) and potentially a couple of more subreddits i posted in.. Most of you were very critical and the other gods were very supportive of my effort.  So i took all the feedback, used ChatGPT, Claude and other stuff and i took some important takeways.  
What you folks here told me: 1. Form validation too lenient - 0 , 0 , 0 -- So ya badasses i fixed that ( Now i implemented proper depth + pause detection - every angle for each exercise is not properly form validated -- I took like 200 + reference videos of each exercises and came to proper form detection now it will be 0-1-1-1-1-1 )  
2. App name wont pass the app stores ( Yah i know it. So i changed it :-)  and we are right now under apple review )  
 3. Difficulty levels which was a counter to all the form freaks.. Yes i implemented a difficulty level for all levels of users..  
4. Ghost mode ( one of my favs. luv to the users who suggested this.  So I have implemented ghost mode with instructor and with your best reps.  
5. Fully Offline analysis ( Unless you need an AI to tell you more ) -- Remember I said I don want my fat ass being saved on a server ? I am sticking to it.. Only the reps and non visual data is being saved to the server so that I can serve your data better and you can opt off we-- If you dont want it, turn it off and its 100 % on device.. No cloud bullshit..  
6. 30+ exercises ( yet to be implemented in the main app ) -- Someone asked me for more than pushups, We have more i am incorporating more than 400 + exercises.. I am a solo dev so for the start we will go with 30 and i will go beyond 400 by this time 2026.  
7. TV Version :-) I have a huge surprise.. No Internet needed. Just a webcam attached to your TV.  Thats coming too. Adding pics..  
8. Roasting - You folks loved it. So i added levels for snowflakes so rest you figure..



More coming soon.  Please consider joining the waitlist

My free image hosting platform just hit 450+ image upload,"So I made imgquik because I didn't find any decent simple image hosting. I use imgur but it's too ""social"" for what it does. I use imgbb but it's too clunky and I can't manage my images. Also, both of these don't support passcode and e2e encryption features, which I found intriguing because the image URL can be stranded somewhere and people can snatch it. So I just want an optional privacy and security feature for something like this. 

Still hard to believe the numbers, 450+ seems not much, but I think it just shows that if you show things to the correct place, people will come eventually.

I will make it free always and forever, but I might introduce some maximum image upload limits in the future if somehow the storage runs out, which is still far from it :)

I built a non-surveillance Git analytics tool after burning out — looking for honest feedback on my MVP,"Hey everyone,

I’m a developer who hit burnout last year.

Not because of too much work… but because I had zero visibility on how I was actually working.

Some days I felt productive but shipped nothing.

Other days I shipped a ton but felt terrible.

I had no idea when I was in deep-focus mode, when I was fragmented, or when fatigue was creeping in.

So I built something for myself.

👉 **GitSpirit** — a tool that analyzes your GitHub activity privately, and gives you insights about your rhythm, flow, fatigue signals, and “golden hours” of focus.

It does not read code.

It does not send anything to employers.

It’s literally just for you — like a personal coach based on your commit patterns.

I turned it into an MVP with a feed + stories UI (not a typical dashboard), and now I’m trying to validate if this is actually useful to others.

If anyone here wants to take a look and tell me what makes sense (or doesn’t), I’d be super grateful: [https://gitspirit.com](https://gitspirit.com)

  
I’m especially interested in:

Does the value proposition click?

Does the onboarding feel safe (privacy-wise)?

Are the insights actually helpful?

  
Even 1–2 sentences of feedback help a ton.

🚨 We Analysed 100 New SaaS Startups — Only 4% Had “Good Enough” Schema Markup. Here’s Why That’s a Problem.,"Hey founders — over the past week we’ve been digging into a sample of 100 early-stage SaaS products listed on Product Hunt and discussed across various Reddit startup threads.

We expected schema usage to be inconsistent… but the actual results were pretty poor:

# 📊 Key Findings

* **Only 18%** of the SaaS sites we analysed had *any* schema markup present.
* **Only 4%** met the quality threshold our models use to determine whether schema is:
   * complete
   * correctly structured
   * aligned with Google’s current guidelines
   * actually valuable enough to justify its existence

Given how competitive early-stage SaaS has become — and how heavily Google leans on structured data for visibility — these numbers are *alarmingly low*.

# 🤔 Why Are Founders Sacrificing Schema?

After digging into patterns across those 100 products, we think it comes down to a combination of:

**1. Lack of knowledge**  
Many founders simply don’t know what [Schema.org](http://Schema.org) markup even is, let alone how to implement it properly. It’s “invisible work,” so it gets pushed aside.

**2. Underestimating its importance**  
Schema rarely feels urgent… until you’re fighting for rankings. Most early SaaS teams prioritise product, onboarding, and marketing over technical SEO foundations.

**3. Complexity & maintenance overhead**  
Even when founders *do* add schema, it’s often:

* outdated
* incomplete
* not updated as the product evolves Schema is “set and forget”… until it isn’t.

**4. No tooling to help**  
Most teams don’t have the bandwidth to maintain structured data manually. And with limited technical SEO tools focused on SaaS, it often falls through the cracks.

Curious to know how often you guys are utilising accurate schema across your sites?",Promise-Asleep,1pee6iz,SideProject,04-12-2025,23:39:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pee6iz/we_analysed_100_new_saas_startups_only_4_had_good/

spent 2 weeks building an AI that remembers all my random shower thoughts. just launched,"so i have this problem where i record voice memos literally everywhere (walking dog, driving, 3am can't sleep) and then... never listen to them again. like 400+ memos just rotting in my phone.

finally got tired of it and built something.

it's called SpeakSummarize. you talk to it, it gives you instant summaries. but the actually cool part is ""Echo"" - an AI that remembers YOU, not just your notes.

like a friend who actually listens lol

what it does:

\- transcribe your rambling (works in 13 languages)

\- instant summaries with action items

\- Echo remembers context about you/your projects/your life

\- you can ask it stuff weeks later like ""what was that idea i had about the marketing thing"" and it knows



why Echo is different:

used Mem0 instead of basic RAG. it doesn't just search documents, it builds a memory graph OF YOU. remembers your projects, preferences, patterns. feels weirdly personal in a good way.

built it in 14 days. SwiftUI + OpenAI + Pinecone + Mem0.

pricing is $4.99/month (intro - raising it later) with 15 free recordings to try. 7 day trial.

honestly just wanted to solve my own problem but figured others might have the same issue?

I built an app that lets you program on paper or any iOS Device.,"Hello!

I want to share this project I've been working on to see if I can help anyone with the same issue. In the last 3 years, my school and university had me sit coding exams on paper- I found revising for this difficult as I could never test my code without having to waste a of time retyping on a laptop. After days of research, I couldn't find a solution to my issue.  
  
As a result, I decided to create ""WriteToRun"", this is an iOS app that bridges the gap for coding on paper and compiling code. It uses a custom built algorithm and AI to accurately transcibe handwritten code using your camera whether this is on lined paper or whiteboard- or you can even use the stylus feature to write on our inbuilt canvas. The app then allows you to use the transcription into our compiler which supports live input and is completely built and hosted by me.

Hopefully with my app, you can optimise your exam practice. Not only is this good for students- this is also good for teachers and examiners who are marking handwritten code, they can scan pupils Python or Java, or Javascript code and test whether their code has any errors.

There is a full video showcase of my app via this link to the app store, or search ""WriteToRun"" in the app store!.

"[PWA Launch] Trak30: A Minimal & Meaningful Finance Tracker (100% Free, No Ads). Built to solve the 'paywall problem' in budgeting apps.","Hello fellow builders and developers,
We are the team at CodeDevHub. 

We just launched Trak30, a PWA budget tracker. We built it because we were frustrated that nearly every powerful finance app is now locked behind a paywall, making budgeting inaccessible for many.

Our core goal was to create a tool that is Minimal & Meaningful and available to everyone for free.

Key Features & Dev Notes:
• 100% Free, No Ads, No Paywalls: Full feature access, forever. We rely on voluntary community support.

• Progressive Web App (PWA): Works seamlessly on any device (iOS, Android, Desktop). We prioritized PWA architecture for maximum reach and zero app store friction.

• The Focus: The app generates a Financial Health Score and identifies ""Money Leaks"" (tracking small, frequent purchases that drain the budget—a common user pain point).

• Use Cases: Designed for personal tracking but also handles shared family accounts and simple small business expenses.

We'd welcome your thoughts on the approach:
1. PWA/Tech Stack: What are your thoughts on using PWA as the sole delivery method for a finance app?

2. UX & Design: Is the minimal design successful in making complex data (like the circular category chart) easier to digest?

Build with someone. Even if that someone is AI,"The hardest part of side projects isn't the code.
It's the loneliness.
You're building at 11pm after your day job. Nobody to talk through ideas with. Nobody to tell you if you're going in the right direction. Nobody to keep you going when you're stuck.
You want to bounce ideas off someone, but:
* Your friends don't get it
* Your family thinks it's a waste of time
* Your co-workers are asleep
* You can't afford to hire anyone
So you grind alone. And eventually, you quit.
Not because the idea was bad. Because building alone is brutal.

Yoodio - AI radio app where DJs are your companions (November Update),"https://preview.redd.it/o5oi9r5gy95g1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3d44b4036d965c153138c084812a46c8f3ebfc8

  
Hi r/sideproject,

I'm quiche. An indie developer who's been working on Yoodio Radio. It's an ai radio app where you can create radio stations using prompts. **Eg. an house music mix station hosted by an astronaut on the ISS**  
  
The DJs at these stations become your ai companions as they get to know you and bring you the best music for the moment. They speak in between tracks and bring you music commentary, local news, weather updates, and even traffic conditions. Kind of like how radio did before it became filled with ads and algorithms.

Unlike ChatGPT, Yoodio's DJs have distinct personalities that can relate to what you're going through. They remember what you like and don't like. They talk between songs about music, life, and offer advice to get you through whatever's going on in your daily life.   
  
**Why It's Different than Spotify/Apple Music:** Instead of music algorithms optimizing for your taste, the AI guides you through and learns what you like. You always have someone to entertain you when you're in the mood for music. And they always have new tracks, ones you've never heard before, cued up for when you're ready to listen.

**Pricing: Free (with a very optional upgrade)** the app's free tier is more than enough for someone who's trying it out for the first time. But if you'd like to get more time on the air with your hosts, the $0.99 pro upgrade (usually $2.99) is a great option to take advantage of.

I'm focused on retention right now and making the DJs feel even more like friends you want to come back to. I'd love feedback on:

* First impression when you open the app
* Do the DJ personalities land?
* What would make you come back daily?
* Feature requests

"How come the same post that got 7000 likes on Twitter, got zero interactions here?","I’ve been going through an epiphany moment today, as I realized that lack of audience, or the wrong audience, might be interpreted as invalidation.

Back in June I had this insight that AI could be used during the recording process across different modalities. Posted such a use case on Twitter in October after the product was well under way, as a sketch. And yesterday I posted the demo across several Reddit communities, and on hacker news. And.. crickets.

Yet, the same thing done as a prototype - as you see it in the images above, and posted on Twitter by someone with a large audience, got hundreds of comments, thousands of likes and bookmarks.

Obviously this is a blessing in disguise. Had I not seen the reaction of people, I would have thought that the lack of reaction of this community, or all the others, equals invalidation. And I would have read it this way for all future use cases and products also. But now I know - lack of audience or the wrong audience != invalidation. And more importantly she validated this and I can finally focus on that specific cluster of customers. So thanks for nothing Reddit. 😁😅

I hope this saves everyone some cycles and gives them new ideas to approach validation. Clearly posting on Reddit or Hacker News isn’t it most of the times.

I built an AI that creates full courses from oddly specific topics — want me to make one for you?,"I’ve been building a tool that turns *very specific curiosities* into complete learning paths using real videos and articles from around the internet.

Not broad topics like “learn python” or “cooking,” but stuff people actually wonder about, like:

* why airplanes really stay in the air
* how the Roman Republic collapsed
* how to negotiate like a senior PM
* how lasers work
* why the US healthcare system is so complex
* how to understand modern art
* how to draw faces at tricky angles
* how to stop procrastinating using evidence-based methods
* how personal investing actually works

I made a simple iPhone app to combine Twitch & Kick chat!,"Hey guys!

I originally made this iOS app called Twick just for myself, to see Twitch and Kick chat in one feed without switching apps because I watch streamers like xQc. But since it turned out pretty useful, I decided to keep improving it and share it with others.

It supports emotes from 7TV, BTTV, FFZ and the Kick/Twitch emotes as well.

Day 2 of Turning Math Papers into CUDA code,"This week's sideproject is learning CUDA by turning math papers into code. 

We use index calculus to break passowrds in Diffie-Hellman.

The paper *Factoring with Two Large Primes* (Lenstra & Manasse, 1994) demonstrates how to increase efficiency by utilising ‘near misses’ during relation collection in index calculus.

I wanted to code it all in CUDA but encountered few opportunities for parallelization.

I built a free iOS browser that lets you watch up to 4 videos,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share a side project I've been working on. It’s a multi-window browser app for iOS called Fukumado Multi Player.

The Problem:
I love watching live streams (Twitch/YouTube), and often I want to watch multiple streams at once—like a game tournament with different viewpoints, or just keeping up with two favorite streamers. However, doing this on a mobile device usually results in messy audio overlapping, and standard browsers don't handle split-screens well.

The Solution:
I built this app to allow users to browse and watch up to 4 screens simultaneously.

Key Features:

Multi-View: Choose between 2, 3, or 4 split-screen layouts.

Audio Control: Due to iOS specifications, audio can only be played for one video at a time, but you can easily switch audio sources using the audio switch button.

Optimized for Streamers: Works great with YouTube and Twitch.
Dark Mode Support
It is completely free to use.

I would love to get your feedback on the UI/UX or any features you think are missing.

I’m making a super minimal wellness tracker (just activity + rest). Curious if this idea even makes sense.,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been tinkering with a small project called **FitRest**, and the whole thing basically came from me getting tired of overly complicated fitness apps. Most of them want you to track everything, steps, food, macros, workouts, mood, water, sleep cycles, heart rate, whatever. It becomes a full-time job.

So I wanted to see what happens if you take all of that away and just keep two habits:  
**Did you move today?**  
**Did you rest properly?**

That’s it.  
No programs, no weekly “optimize yourself” reminders, no giant dashboards. Just quick check-ins and a clean weekly view so you can see your patterns without it becoming stressful.

Right now I’m trying to figure out:

* Is this level of simplicity actually useful?
* Or does it end up feeling empty because it’s *too* minimal?
* If you’ve ever tried to build a habit tracker, where did you get stuck?
* And for people who like simple tools, what stops you from sticking with them long term?

I’m not trying to pitch anything, just honestly trying to understand if this direction has legs before I keep building. Happy to hear any thoughts, even if it’s “this will only work for like five people.”

I’m building a full AI-powered outreach system (not just a simple agent). It runs the entire cold outreach pipeline on its own:

• Finds businesses from Google Maps  
• Audits their website using a vision model  
• Extracts emails and filters them with RAG  
• Verifies which email is actually valid  
• Scores the business using RAG + a memory layer  
• Generates a personalized outreach message  
• Reads and understands replies  
• And creates a detailed PDF report for each business

What I’m excited about is that every stage has its own intelligence. The website audit influences scoring, the scoring influences personalization, and the memory layer helps the system improve as it processes more leads.

So yeah the title pretty much says it all. I've been building apps for a while now, but I'm just not the most UI savvy person.

I've tried the other AI UI design apps out there, but imo they're just so subpar that I've found no use for them.

So I decided to try and build out one of my own and I'm actually blown away by the results. It took a while to get the workflow right, but wow it was worth it. No complex prompts, just single sentence inputs and out comes some beautiful looking UI. In fact, it's so good that I used it to design the website itself!

"I got tired of chasing feedback across WhatsApp, email, and Slack — so I built a simple bug reporting widget","Hey everyone,

I've been building side projects for a while, and the most annoying part was never the coding — it was collecting feedback.

Every time I asked someone to test my app, I'd get:

\- WhatsApp voice notes

\- Screenshots in email with no context

\- ""It's broken"" messages with zero details

\- Random files in a shared Google Drive folder

So I built VibeQA — a feedback widget you add with one line of code. Testers click a button, describe the issue, and it automatically captures the screenshot, browser info, console errors, and device details.

No login required for testers. They just click and report.

It's live and I'm looking for a few people to try it out. Happy to give free access to anyone here who wants to test it on their project.

**ThreeDepth** is a free utility that uses local, in-browser rendering via Three.js and R3F that I built to solve those problems.

I’m excited to share that I’ve released version **1.3.0** of my side project app!

I chose the **Snowball Method** because paying off debt isn’t just about numbers, it’s about motivation. Starting with your smallest balances gives you quick wins, helps you see progress faster, and keeps you emotionally invested in the process.

5 Things I Learned Getting My First 250 Users as a Student Founder,"I’m a college student building a productivity tool, and I recently hit 250 users.  
Here are the 5 biggest lessons I learned getting there 

1. Your first users come from tight circles, not the whole internet

I wasted so much time posting in random subreddits and Discord servers.  
What actually worked was focusing on one community where the problem is real — my own university.  
Niche > broad.

2. Professors are secretly the best distribution channel

I thought none of them would reply, but sending a simple, respectful email landed me a few responses and one professor shared my tool with all her classes.  
That one “yes” outperformed every marketing attempt I tried.

3. Remove friction until the first 30 seconds feel magical

Students bounce FAST.  
Once I changed my onboarding to:  
upload → see results → optional signup,  
my conversion rate jumped massively.  
The simpler you make the first step, the more people try it.

4. Fix issues publicly and fast

I told early users:  
“If anything breaks, DM me — I’ll fix it same day.”  
That transparency turned testers into supporters.  
People love builders who move quickly and listen.

5. Social proof multiplies everything

When I could say, “A professor shared this with her classes,” engagement went way up.  
Small wins matter. Share them.  
People trust momentum.

Early-stage side-project: A chatbot with threaded side conversations — feedback welcome!,"I’m working on an early-stage side project called \*\*ThreadBot\*\*. 

The idea is simple: it’s a chatbot, but you can have \*\*side conversations (threads) with it without interrupting the main topic\*\*. Think of it like Slack threads, but with a bot you can ask questions or explore tangents while the main discussion continues.



I’m trying to validate whether this is something people would actually use:

\- Do you struggle keeping side conversations organized in chats?

\- Would a bot that lets you branch off and explore topics in parallel save you time?



I would love feedback from potential users. Any thoughts, suggestions, or questions are super welcome!

Thanks in advance!

I'm exploring an idea called Hypernetic and want to understand if this is a real pain or just my bias.

\- Drop in your website URL

\- AI scans your site and suggests relevant lead magnet ideas

\- Pick one, tweak copy

\- Add a small snippet and it starts capturing + auto-nurturing leads

\- Do you currently capture leads from your main site? Why / why not?

"Built MicroBrief ,a tool that turns 5 inputs into a polished client brief in 5 seconds","Hey everyone 👋,

I built MicroBrief because I was tired of wasting 2-4 hours writing every single client brief. Headlines, angles, CTAs, tone, constraints... it was the same pain every time.

What I wanted instead:

\-> A few inputs

\-> A polished, client-ready brief in seconds

So I made it.



MicroBrief generates a full brief with headline, key points, CTA and tone control across 12 templates like landing pages, Twitter threads, ad copy and emails. No blank page, no overthinking, just copy-paste and deliver.



It's especially helpful if you write briefs repeatedly for multiple clients and would rather spend time on actual work than documentation.

First public release is out, with pricing designed to be flexible: free forever, subscription if you need more, lifetime if you hate recurring billing.

Hey everyone,

I’ve been working on this as a side project: – a simple tool where you screenshot any trading chart (stocks, crypto, forex, whatever) and upload your screenshot of a chart. The AI instantly analyzes it and gives you things like:

- Key support & resistance levels  
- Potential entry/exit points  
- Real-time summaries 
- Risk management suggestions

- Does the analysis feel accurate/useful?  
- What features are missing?  
- How’s the UI/UX?  
- Any bugs or edge cases with certain chart types?

I also kept it chill and user friendly so I let anyone who signs up use it for free with NO credit card needed - when the trial is up and a user wants to keep using it that’s when they are prompted to upgrade for less than a quarter tank of gas ⛽️

So I built [**isat.college**](http://isat.college), a ""walled garden"" identity platform where the database is just a public GitHub repository.

**How it works:**

1. **The Input:** You fork the registry repo and add a simple `yourname.json` file.
2. **The Process:** You open a Pull Request. A GitHub Action validates your JSON schema (checks structure, limits, etc.).
3. **The Result:** Once merged, you instantly get a hosted portfolio at `yourname.isat.college`.

**The Stack:**

* **Frontend:** Astro (CSR) hosted on Cloudflare Pages.
* **""Database"":** GitHub Repo (fetching raw JSON).
* **Subdomains:** Cloudflare Workers + Wildcard DNS.
* **Cost:** $0.

It’s currently in public beta. I’m looking for some developers/students to claim the first few usernames and try to break my schema validation. 😅

I made a free sudoku app without ads for iOS,"Hey everyone!

So I finally launched my Sudoku app: **Sudoku: Daily Brain Workout**.

The funny thing is, when I started creating this project, I had basically never solved a Sudoku puzzle before. I've tried maybe two or three times, but gave up really fast. I didn't create this because I am some kind of Sudoku expert, but for myself to learn.

Building it helped me to understand how Sudoku really works, and why certain techniques actually matter, and how people can solve tougher puzzles. And along the way, I went from “I have no idea what I’m doing” to “okay wow… this is actually really fun”.

So after hundreds of coffee cups, months and months of coding, tweaking, breaking things, fixing things, the app is finally live:

A short description of the app:

* **Daily Sudoku puzzles**, a new board every day - with leaderboard for all who beat the daily puzzle.
* Multiple modes: **Classic**, **Zen**, and **Hardcore.**
* Three different difficulty levels.
* **Explainable technique hints** that actually tells you why a specific technique works (Naked Single, Hidden Single, Naked Pair, Hidden Pair, Pointing Pairs, Box-Line Reductions, X-Wing, etc.)
* **Note mode**, auto-cleaning notes, mistake tracking, undo/redo
* Stats, streaks, and a modern, clean UI

There are still things I am going to add, more solving techniques and different modes. But I’m really excited (and honestly very nervous) to finally share it with actual real Sudoku players, instead of just my own debugging brain.

If anybody here downloads and tries the app, I would love all type of feedback, both good and bad.

* Creates interactive 3D portfolio websites with themes (Earth, Space, Mountain)
* Uses actual Three.js 3D elements, not just CSS tricks
* Delivers fully responsive, mobile-optimized sites
* Provides full code ownership to clients

**Tech Stack:**

* Frontend: Next.js 14 + Three.js + Framer Motion + Tailwind CSS
* Deployment: Vercel
* Performance: Optimized for < 2s load times

**Live Demo:** [https://alex-portfolio-lime-two.vercel.app/](https://alex-portfolio-lime-two.vercel.app/)

**Current Status:**

* ✅ MVP complete with 3 themes
* ✅ Live demo working
* ✅ Starting to take first clients
* 🔄 Adding more customization options

Automate your Discord RPG session transcripts and summaries with Craig & Python,"Hey fellow RPG enthusiasts!

I just finished a 100% free project that automates turning your Discord roleplay recordings into clean transcripts and narrative summaries. If you’ve ever played with friends over Discord using the [**Craig**](https://craig.chat/) bot, you know how messy it can be to take notes manually. This tool handles it all.

**What it does:**

* Takes your Craig audio ZIP files and transcribes all voice tracks locally using Whisper.
* Converts transcripts into structured, readable story summaries using ChatGPT.
* Keeps track of your game context and previous sessions to maintain continuity.
* Fully customizable—you can define context, narrative style, and even tone (Shakespearean, medieval, epic, etc.).

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.10+
* A Craig recording (ZIP) from Discord
* Your own OpenAI/ChatGPT API key
* Basic configuration in a `.env` file (set your key and language)
* Optional: fill in `0. gameInfo/` files to provide context, past summary, and prompt for personalized summaries

**How to use it:**

1. Record your session with Craig on Discord.
2. Drop the ZIP file into the `1. audio/` folder (only the last one will be processed).
3. Run [`main.py`](http://main.py) in Python:

&#8203;

    python ./main.py
    

And that’s it: the pipeline automatically generates

* A transcript in `2. transcripts/`
* A summary in `3. summaries/`

If you want, you can also run the two scripts separately to see the transcript first, then generate the summary.

**Why it’s useful:**

* No more manual note-taking during sessions
* Keep a chronological archive of every line spoken
* Generate consistent story summaries that maintain context across sessions
* Easy to personalize with your own style and prompts

It’s surprisingly simple to get running even if you have basic IT knowledge: just follow the README.

A Drag-and-Drop ShadCN Template Builder,"A builder where you stack components like Lego and export a full template in minutes.

**How it works:**

* Pick a Hero block
* Add an About section
* Drop in Pricing + Testimonials + FAQ
* Reorder everything visually
* Export as a full template in Next.js or React
* (Optional) Generate a GitHub repo for the template

Pick → Arrange → Export → Use.

**Check👉** [template-builder](https://pro.ui-layouts.com/template-builder)

**Why build this when AI exists?**  
Sure, AI can generate components—but here’s the difference:

* AI gives you “something,” but not always something usable
* Your builder provides verified, consistent blocks with clean, ready-to-use code

**The long-term vision:**

* 100+ variations per category
* Templates for any niche: SaaS, agency, portfolio, blog, dashboard, and more
* Eventually: describe the layout you want, and AI assembles it using the blocks

I wrote a research paper on why AI benchmarks are becoming unreliable (Goodhart's Law),"Hey everyone! I've been working on a side project exploring why AI benchmarks might be lying to us.

\*\*The core idea:\*\* When metrics become targets, they stop being good measures (Goodhart's Law). This is happening with AI benchmarks like MMLU and HumanEval.

\*\*Some findings:\*\*
- GPT-4 guessed missing MMLU answer options correctly 57% of the time vs 25% chance - suggesting memorization
- 40+ point gap between benchmark scores and real-world performance on coding tasks
- MMLU scores compressed from 17.5-point spread (2023) to just 0.3 points (2024)

Feedback please,"I struggled with discipline for a year. I tried routines, motivation videos, and every hack people talk about. None worked long term. So I stopped looking for motivation and built a system instead.

Paid memberships fund cash prize pools. Sixty percent of all membership money goes straight to winners. You put in work. You earn points. You get paid based on performance.

• bring more traffic

Weekend build: AI startup idea generator + founder validation layer,"Shipping a side project this weekend. Would love feedback on the concept.

The Idea:

Most idea generators suck because they're random. ""Blockchain for dog walking"" type garbage.

Mine is different:

1. Starts with REAL pain points (scraped from Reddit, Twitter, etc.)
2. Uses AI to collision 2 industries intelligently
3. Most importantly: Shows you founders who ALREADY tried this idea- What happened to them?- Did they succeed/fail?- What did they learn?

  
Example output:

""FinTech + Logistics = Invoice factoring for truckers""

→ Founder A: Got acquired by bank after 2 years

→ Founder B: Failed because logistics companies wouldn't adopt

→ Founder C: Pivoted to construction, now at $100K MRR

Tech:

\- Claude or Gemni API for AI reasoning

\- Vanilla JS (speed over complexity)

\- GitHub Pages hosting

\- Free tier everything

I built a subscription tracker for myself because I kept forgetting to cancel things,"I have ADHD and here's the thing: I could literally SEE the charges hitting my account every month, but I'd just... forget to cancel them. Notice it, get annoyed, five minutes later it's gone from my brain.

**$34/month. $408/year. Just burning away on stuff I didn't even use:**

* Netboom & EasyFun - cloud gaming for a mobile game I can't even play anymore ($20)
* Patreon - some gaming YouTuber I haven't watched in months ($5)
* Windscribe VPN - used it for literally one month ($9)

**What I tried (and why it failed):**

* Spreadsheet templates - opened it once, never again
* Google Calendar reminders - snoozed
* Phone alarms - snoozed

Anything requiring me to actively remember wasn't gonna work. I needed something that would bug me until I dealt with it.

So I built a [website](https://vexly.app) that reminds me EVERY SINGLE DAY starting 7 days before renewal until I mark it as ""keep"" or ""cancel."" Can't ignore it even if I wanted to.

**What it does:**

* Daily reminders before you get charged (the annoying kind that actually work)
* Split costs for family/shared subscriptions
* Analytics to see where your money's actually going
* Categories to organize everything

A couple weeks ago I posted a tiny MVP here. It blew up. So I spent the last week turning it into a real app. Would love feedback.,"A few weeks ago I shared a super rough MVP here. It was just something I built for myself because my phone was always stuck on “Storage Almost Full” and my camera roll had turned into this overwhelming mess I kept avoiding. I honestly thought maybe ten people would see it.

But the post took off way more than I expected. So many people commented or messaged me saying they felt the exact same stress trying to clean their photos. I didn’t expect that at all, and it kind of made me realize this wasn’t just my problem. That alone pushed me to keep building.

So the last week I’ve been putting my head down and actually turning it into a real app. Fixing bugs. Improving the flow. Redesigning the screens. Making the swiping feel smooth. Just trying to make something I’d actually want to use every day instead of a little hack I threw together.

My camera roll used to feel impossible to clean. I’d open it and immediately feel stressed looking at random screenshots, duplicate selfies, blurry photos I don’t remember taking, and memes from years ago. For some reason it just made my brain feel cluttered too. And every time I tried to fix it, I’d give up within a minute.

The MVP let me swipe through everything quickly. Right to keep, left to delete. Something about that made the whole task feel lighter. Like I could finally get ahead of the mess instead of drowning in it.

Now I’m about a week away from launching the full thing. If anyone here wants to try the early version or give feedback, I’d really appreciate it. This subreddit weirdly gave me the motivation to take it seriously, and I’m grateful for that.

I’m curious if anyone else here has had that moment where you build something just to fix your own annoyance, and suddenly you realize a bunch of other people needed it too. It’s been a strange but really cool feeling.

"After two years of work, I finally released my first app: a floating multi-counter for piano practice (Android)","Hey everyone,

I’m a classical piano major who somehow ended up spending a lot of time as a kind of solo indie dev on the side.

When I practice (scales, études, tricky passages, etc.), a counter is almost essential for me.

But every counter app I tried had something missing for how I use it:

\- too many ads

\- no easy way to set custom step values (+1, +5, +10, …)

\- awkward to use while watching YouTube / practicing / gaming

So I decided to build my own and keep iterating on it.

Recently I released it on the Play Store.

\---

\## Moong Counter – floating multi-counter app

Platform: Android (Flutter)

Play Store: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moongsoon.counterapp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moongsoon.counterapp)

Main features:

\- Multiple counters

\- Create as many counters as you want

\- Set custom names and step values (+1, +5, +10, etc.)

\- Floating overlay

\- The main counter UI itself can float over other apps

\- You can adjust the opacity so it stays usable without blocking the screen too much

\- You can freely resize and move it, from a tiny corner counter to a larger one when needed

\- 24 languages

\- UI localized into 24 languages (not just raw machine translation)

\- 5 themes

\- Main look is a toy-like yellow dog-shaped counter

\- Also includes darker and more neutral themes

\- History and export

\- Logs changes so you can review them later

\- Export to CSV or JSON

\- No ads at all

\- There are no ads anywhere in the app

Monetization:

\- Free tier: basic counters and core usage

\- Premium:

\- unlimited counters

\- floating overlay

\- export

\- all themes

\- 30-day free trial for the premium features

\---

\## Visual style (first impression)

The visual direction is intentionally playful.

The main counter is designed like a yellow dog-shaped handheld toy counter.

I know this kind of look will not fit everyone’s taste.

When you see it in the screenshots, what is your first reaction?

\- looks fun / cute / memorable

\- looks too childish for me

\- not sure what I’m looking at

\- something else

Short, honest reactions are totally fine.

\## What I’d like feedback on

1. Actual use casesIf you ever use counters:- Would you see yourself keeping something like this installed?- If yes, for what (practice, workouts, study, gaming, something else)?
2. Generic vs specificThere are a lot of counter apps already.Does this feel like just another generic counter,or does it seem useful for a clearer niche (for example, practice-focused, overlay-focused, etc.)?
3. Visual and style fitWith the toy-like main theme and the current screenshots,does the overall look make you more curious to try it,or does it push you away?

Any thoughts, criticism, or suggestions are welcome.

* Runs AI models fully offline on-device
* No accounts, no cloud, no tracking
* Works even with no signal or Wi-Fi
* Tools inside: summarizer, translator, PDF summary, rewriting, email generator
* Voice input and voice output
* Camera OCR to extract text from images
* Multi chat sessions
* Supports multiple languages for responses
* Dark mode and light mode
* Image viewer inside chat + voice playback
* Games for fun use cases
* Updated recently with UI improvements, error handling, and crash fixes
* DeepSeek, Phi, Llama, Gemma and small lightweight free models for older devices

I'm currently trying to understand how to grow downloads organically. ASO is the area I know the least about, so I would really appreciate advice from those with experience. What should I focus on first  keywords, screenshots, icon, video preview, title, or something else?

How to get first 10 paid Customers,"
For the longest time, I assumed I was “doing customer discovery” by checking Subreddit, Hacker News, and niche forums every day.

But if I’m being honest, it felt more like guesswork:

* Scrolling for the right keywords
* Jumping between posts
* Catching the perfect thread… hours after the conversation died
* Feeling like I was always late to help anyone

And the worst part ?

I kept wondering how many conversations I *never* even saw.

Eventually I hit a point where I thought:

*""There has to be a better way to find people who actually need what I’m building, right when they need it.""*

So I built **[Leadlee](http://www.leadlee.co)**.

It’s super simple, but it pretty much solved the problem for me:

* **It monitors the communities** where my potential customers hang out
* **It cuts the noise**, only surfacing posts where someone has a real need
* **It notifies me instantly**, so I can jump into the conversation while it's still alive - not after it's frozen over

And honestly?

It’s taken a ridiculous amount of stress off my plate.

Instead of chasing threads all day, I get actual opportunities delivered to me *exactly when they matter*.

Now I’m opening it up to early users, because I have a feeling I’m not the only one who’s been missing out on conversations that could’ve changed everything.

So I’d love to hear from you:

1. Do you feel like you miss customer conversations just because you don’t see them in time?
2. What would you want a tool like this to track for you first ?
3. How much time do you think this could save you each week ?

needed branding for my food delivery mvp. spent a weekend with AI instead of hiring someone,"working on a side project for healthy meal delivery (farm-to-table veggie bowls). can handle the tech side but branding was blocking me. zero design skills.

got quotes from designers, $1500-2500 for a full package. way too much when I haven't validated anything yet. tried canva but everything looked generic.

ended up testing an AI tool that generates brand systems instead of just logos. you describe what you want and it builds the whole identity. told it ""root vegetables, sustainable, earthy tones"" and got this:

these are just mockups from the tool, not real products yet. but the consistency surprised me. same logo across different packaging, same colors. might be good enough for a landing page to test interest.

still not 100% sold on the name but at least I have something to work with now.

question: for those who've done food delivery, do you validate with mockups first or do people expect real product photos before they'll sign up?",Additional-Engine402,1peqzpx,SideProject,05-12-2025,10:43:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1peqzpx/needed_branding_for_my_food_delivery_mvp_spent_a/
"Built a clean mutual fund SIP calculator app (no ads, free) — suggestions?","Hey everyone,  
I’ve been working on a SIP & Mutual Fund calculator app for some time. I originally uploaded it 2 years ago, but for the past couple of months I've been actively improving it — new features, better UI, and still completely **ad-free**.  
I'm building this for fun + to help people plan investments without those pop-ups, paywalls, or clutter you see everywhere.

Here’s what it does right now:

**Core Features**  
• SIP Calculator (monthly investments)  
• Lumpsum Calculator  
• Step-Up SIP (increase SIP yearly — great for salary growth)  
• Goal-Based Investing (retirement, house, child education etc.)  
• Inflation-adjusted results → shows real purchasing power in future  
• Interactive compounding charts  
• Calculation history + reopen saved results  
• Light/Dark theme  
• Ad-free forever

**Why I made it**  
Most calculators only show future value without accounting for inflation or goal planning. Realistically, ₹50 lakh 20 years later ≠ ₹50 lakh today. I wanted something clean, fast, and useful for actual planning — not just one-time calculation.

I’d love **feedback, criticism, feature ideas — anything.**  
Especially from people who actively invest so I can make it more practical for real-world use.

"I built a tool that helps founders create marketing 10× faster, because most of us don’t have time to do it ourselves","I’m a solo founder who realized something uncomfortable: most products don’t fail because they’re bad. They fail because marketing never happens consistently.  
  
**After surveying \~180 founders, these numbers stuck with me:**  
  
\- 72% said they don’t have a marketing system  
\- 58% create content only when “inspired”  
\- Only 11% feel confident with their GTM  
  
And honestly… I was one of them.  
  
I’d spend hours building features, then freeze when it was time to post.  
SEO stayed on my to-do list for months.

Emails felt like homework.  
Competitors grew faster simply because they communicated better.  
  
So I started building small tools to make marketing easier for myself.  
Those tools eventually became **MyCMO**  
  
**What it does**  
  
• **If you’re out of content ideas** → X/LinkedIn/Instagram/TikTok/YouTube Studios create posts & scripts fast.  
• **If your copy sounds robotic** → Copy Refiner + Smart Reply fix tone and clarity.  
• **No time for blogs or emails** → Blog Writer + Email Campaign generate long-form content.  
• **Unsure who your customers really are** → Find Audience shows where they hang out online.  
• **GTM feels like guesswork** → Growth Engine gives a simple 10-module roadmap.  
• **SEO feels overwhelming** → SEO Optimiser + pSEO + Competitor Analyzer tell you what to rank for.  
• **Need fast clarity** → Growth Card gives a 5-step plan in 60 seconds.  
  
MyCMO isn’t meant to replace marketers, it’s for founders who don’t have one yet, but still need momentum.  
  
It’s live now with a free tier.

“Would you use an app that improves your voice delivery for videos/public speaking?”,"Hey everyone, I’m working on an app idea and I want brutally honest feedback.

The app helps people improve their voice delivery for things like:
• YouTube videos
• Instagram Reels
• Public speaking
• Auditions / Acting scenes
• Podcast intros
• School presentations

How it works:
1. You upload your script (or paste text)
2. The app analyzes it and improves it for spoken delivery
3. It gives an AI example of how the script SHOULD be delivered (tone, pace, emotion)
4. You record your own version
5. The app compares your delivery vs the AI and gives feedback + scores
6. You can practice until you improve

Basically: a voice coach + acting coach + script delivery assistant in one app.

It’s called [**Resumly.ai**](http://Resumly.ai), a tool that helps people create and refine resumes, check for missing keywords, and tailor their documents to specific job descriptions.

The idea came from watching friends struggle with rewriting their resumes over and over for different roles, especially when applying to competitive companies. I wanted to build something that makes that part of the job search a little less stressful.

Right now, it does things like:

* Suggests stronger bullet points
* Highlights weak or vague phrasing
* Identifies missing skills based on the job description
* Provides a cleaner, more readable structure
* Helps with ATS optimization without sounding robotic

"Why is adding a blog to AI-built apps still this hard? I tested DropInBlog, Ghost, Hashnode…","I built a URL shortener API last year. The product worked fine but I couldn't drive traffic. That's when it hit me that I needed content and needed a blog.

Then I started building my next project entirely on Lovable. And I ran into something I didn't expect:

There's no good way to add a blog to an AI-built site.

You can create static pages all day. But a blog? That's a CMS. That's dynamic content.

So I looked at my options:

* DropInBlog: $24-49/mo, copy embed code, manually style it to match your site
* Quickblog: ""Drop 2 lines of code"" but which 2 lines? Where? Now you're burning prompts figuring out integration
* Feather: Connect Notion, configure domain, set up DNS... for a Lovable app?
* Build it yourself: 50+ prompts on CRUD, routing, an editor... and you still don't have SEO tools

Every single option assumes you're a developer or wants you to leave your AI builder workflow.

None of them let you just paste a prompt and be done.

So I built something for myself. Then figured others might want it too.

Here's how it works:

* Copy a prompt from the dashboard
* Paste it into your AI builder (Lovable, Bolt, Replit, etc.)
* Done. Working /blog page.
* Write posts with AI assistance they show up on your site instantly

One prompt. Full blog. Your design.

Still early days, I am polishing things and onboarding a few people at a time.

If you're building with AI tools and want a blog that doesn't fight your workflow, comment ""Blog"" and I'll DM you early access.

Happy to answer questions about the approach too.

"I built an AI Agent that architects n8n workflows because translating ""Business Problems"" into ""Nodes"" is actually really hard","I’ve noticed a pattern when talking to business owners about automation. They know exactly *what* is broken (""My onboarding is slow,"" ""I hate copying data to Excel""), but they know what nodes to choose.

They don't know how to translate a ""Business Friction"" into a ""Technical Diagram.""

I wanted to bridge that gap. So I built **Automation Consultant**.

**👇 Watch the demo below to see it turn a manual pain point into a technical blueprint in seconds.**

It’s an intelligent dashboard that acts as your Solutions Architect.

**How it works:**

1. **Structured Intake:** The UI asks the right questions, extracting the Industry, the specific Bottleneck, and the Tech Stack.
2. **The Analysis:** An AI Agent (running on n8n) translates those human problems into technical logic (Trigger → Process → Action).
3. **The Blueprint:** It outputs a visual Node Graph and a strategic breakdown. You can even copy this blueprint and feed it to ChatGPT to write the code for you.

I wanted to test the limits of AI coding, so I built the **entire Frontend using Google AI Studio**. From the complex React state management to the UI design, it was all generated by AI.

It’s a fully functional tool, built by AI, for automation builders.

I believe in open-sourcing helpful tools, so the full code (React) and the Backend Workflow (n8n) are available for free on GitHub: [https://github.com/not0lucky/ai-automation-consultant](https://github.com/not0lucky/ai-automation-consultant)

"My wife was manually copying YouTube comments, so I built this tool.","Hi everyone,

I built a Python desktop app to extract YouTube comments, and I wanted to share it here.

**The Backstory**

My wife analyzes business content on YouTube, and I noticed she was manually copying and pasting comments into Excel. It was painful to watch, so I spent a weekend building a tool to automate it for her. I figured if she needed it, others might too.

**What it does**

It's a desktop GUI (built with CustomTkinter) that uses the YouTube API to:

* **Batch Process:** Handle multiple videos in a single run.
* **Filter Spam/Bots:** I added a keyword-based filter to catch obvious spam (crypto scams, WhatsApp numbers, etc.) while erring on the side of keeping valuable, borderline comments.
* **Sort by Signal:** Sorts comments by like count, so you see the most important feedback first.
* **Export Data:** Saves everything to clean CSVs (Metadata + Comments).

**Why use this over a Chrome Extension?**

I didn't want to pay for a subscription or hit usage limits on existing tools. This application is completely **free, open-source, and runs locally** on your machine. Your API key stays in your local settings.json file.

**The Tech Stack**

* Python
* CustomTkinter (for the UI)
* YouTube Data API v3
* Pandas

You can run it as a Python script or build it into a standalone Windows .exe using PyInstaller (instructions in the README).

It's fully open-source under the MIT license.

So I started quietly building a private Discord called **AI Competence Guild**.

Inside, I post things like:

* clear income paths that use AI as leverage
* templates for real offers
* research prompts
* rapid build sprints
* niche opportunity scans
* systems that remove guesswork

* building side projects,
* trying to package your skills,

I built an AI IDE that lets you and the agent work together,"Hi everyone, I built BrilliantCode, https://brilliantai.co, an AI IDE that functions as your super smart pair programmer.

4 lessons I’ve learned:

⁠Scratching your own itch is really fun when you’re but people can get confused if your product doesn’t feel familiar: I didn’t like the user experience of working inside CLIs so I decided to build an agent that could spawn terminals rather than just work from inside one. I also added a browser and a code editor to make it easier to have all my dev tools in one place. But when I finished, it was hard to explain to people whether what I had built was a coding agent or an IDE. So I settled for agentic IDE which means an AI agent with an IDE it can fully control, like a ghost in the machine.

2.	⁠Feature creep is real, as an indie dev stop it before it stops you: The most important thing you need as an indie dev is ruthless focus. Every extra day you spend on adding a new feature is time that you are not spending in the market.

Especially for big projects like this, you need to be very ruthless with narrowing down what is to be included with yoru MVP. I spent a lot of time adding new fancy stuff to differentiate my product but the only thing people really care about, as I’ve come to find out, is the agent writing code reliably. This would not be an issue for a bigger team, but it can be really hard for a bootstrapped solo founder when you have to manage your codebase, fix bugs, do marketing, create content and talk to users all by yourself. Allocate your energy wisely.

3. Building in a competitive market requires confidence: This is the 5th product I will be building since I started on my enterpreneur journey middle of 2023. Every time, I spent months building only to find that there was either no market or people simply didn’t care enough about the problem I was solving.

Then I came up with a formula: identify the most impactful product category that has helped me in my founder journey and build that. I decided to go with building a coding agent because of how much these tools empower me.

But the space is very fiercely competitive, there are so many players: frontier labs, heavily-funded startups, popular open source projects. I won’t lie, I got a little scared. However, I’ve also found that the market is really big and people are very happy to try new tools. If I succeed in capturing just a very small share of the market, that’s all that matters.

4. Talking to users is as important as building the best product: With BrilliantCode, I am able to dogfood it a lot because it’s very helpful in my work, but the way I use it is very different from how users interact with it. From speaking with beta testers, I have found that I need to spend more time making explainer videos and blogs should people exactly what they can achieve with the app and how they can use it. The feedback I’ve gotten from this has been incredibly useful, I will never have discovered this because to me the app is very simple to use.

Getting users is also quite challenging because it’s not easy to get people to take time out of their busy lives to try out your new app that they’ve never heard of before. What I did was narrow down to one ICP and started sending to them one by one on LinkedIn. Maybe 3 out of 50 respond but it’s a numbers game. The more people I reach out to, the bigger my replies become. So I send messages every day and when people respond follow up quickly. I have also refrained from automating this part because I’m following the “do things that don’t scale” advice. Once I’ve gotten my technique down, I can then automate and scale.

I built a Distributed Orchestrator Architecture to replace Search Indexing,"I’ve spent the last month trying to optimize a project for SEO and realized it’s a losing game. So, I built a POC in Python to bypass search indexes entirely.  
  
I am proposing a shift in how we connect LLMs to real-time data. Currently, we rely on Search Engines or Function Calling

I built a POC called **Agent Orchestrator** that moves the logic layer out of the LLM and into a distributed REST network.

**The Architecture:**

1. **Intent Classification:** The LLM receives a user query and hands it to the Orchestrator.
2. **Async Routing:** Instead of the LLM selecting a tool, the Orchestrator queries a registry and triggers relevant external agents via REST API in parallel.
3. **Local Inference:** The external agent (the website) runs its own inference/lookup locally and returns a synthesized answer.
4. **Aggregation:** The Orchestrator aggregates the results and feeds them back to the user's LLM.

I believe this is the logical next step after SEO—optimizing for connection rather than crawling. What do you think?

I’ve open-sourced the project on GitHub.

LinkedIn influencers don't want you to know about engagement pods. Here's the truth.,"I've been deep in the LinkedIn engagement world for 2+ years now, and there's an entire underground economy that most people have no idea exists.

You know those posts that explode with 50+ likes and 20+ comments within the first hour? Yeah, that's usually not organic.

Let me pull back the curtain.

What Are Engagement Pods?

They're groups (usually 10-100 people) who agree to like and comment on each other's posts. The idea is simple: LinkedIn's algorithm rewards early engagement, so if your post gets a bunch of activity in the first 30 minutes, it gets pushed to way more people.

Think of it as a ""you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"" system.

How They Actually Work

The typical flow:

Someone posts on LinkedIn

They drop the link in the pod (Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp group, or dedicated tool)

Everyone in the pod goes and engages within 30 minutes

The algorithm sees the activity spike and boosts the post

Real organic reach follows

Sounds simple, right? But here's where it gets messy.

The Dark Side Nobody Talks About

Problem #1: The Comments Are Awful

Most pod comments are generic garbage:

""Great insight!""

""Thanks for sharing!""

""Love this! 👏""

These stick out like a sore thumb. LinkedIn users aren't stupid—they can spot fake engagement. And honestly? It makes you look bad.

Problem #2: Pods Die Fast

There's always imbalance. Some people take and never give. Others get lazy. Within 3-6 months, most pods fall apart because of:

Freeloaders who don't engage back

Time zones making coordination impossible

People leaving when they realize it's work

Drama (yes, seriously)

Problem #3: LinkedIn Is Getting Smarter

LinkedIn's algorithm now detects patterns:

Same people engaging on every post

Comments posted within seconds of each other

Generic one-word comments

Accounts that only comment, never post

Get flagged, and your reach tanks. I've seen accounts go from 10K impressions to 500 overnight.

Problem #4: The Time Sink

If you're in 3-4 pods with 30 people each, you're spending 2-3 hours a day just fulfilling your engagement obligations. That's not scalable.

But Here's The Thing...

Engagement pods work when done right.

The top LinkedIn creators (100K+ followers) almost all use some form of coordinated engagement. They just do it smarter:

✅ Smaller, high-quality groups (10-15 people max)  
✅ Industry-specific pods (so comments are relevant)  
✅ Written comment guidelines (no generic crap)  
✅ Balanced contribution tracking (kick out freeloaders)  
✅ Staggered engagement (not everyone at once)

The Ethics Question

Is this ""cheating""?

Honestly, I don't think so. Here's why:

Traditional media does this. TV shows have studio audiences. Magazines have editorial networks. Podcasters cross-promote.

It's just distribution. You're still creating the content. The pod just helps it get seen.

LinkedIn WANTS engagement. The algorithm rewards it because engaged users stay on the platform longer.

That said, if you're using pods to promote garbage content? Yeah, that's scammy.

What Actually Works in 2024

The game has changed. Here's what I've learned:

1. Quality > Quantity Better to have 5 thoughtful comments from real people than 50 generic ones.

2. Speed Matters The first 30 minutes are critical. If you can get 10-15 genuine engagements in that window, you're golden.

3. Keep Conversations Going Posts that stay ""alive"" for 2-3 hours (with replies and new comments) get 3-5x more reach than posts that die after 30 minutes.

4. Real Comments Trump Everything LinkedIn's AI can now detect comment quality. Detailed, specific comments boost your post. Generic ones might even hurt it.

5. Consistency Beats Virality Posting 3x a week with solid engagement beats one viral post a month.

My Honest Take

Look, I do use tool in this space (Hyperclapper—helps automate some of this), so I'm biased. But here's what I genuinely believe:

https://preview.redd.it/vwmllacdyd5g1.png?width=842&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1427f5f988d6eca1d39a79ee286c8c6895914d9

Engagement pods aren't evil. They're a tool. Like any tool, they can be used well or used poorly.

The problem isn't the pods themselves—it's how most people use them. Lazy, generic engagement that insults readers' intelligence.

If you're going to use any form of coordinated engagement:

Make sure comments are thoughtful and relevant

Don't engage on content you don't actually support

Balance giving and receiving

Focus on building real relationships, not gaming numbers

The goal should be to jumpstart real conversations, not fake them.

The Bottom Line

Every successful LinkedIn creator has an engagement strategy. Some use pods. Some have loyal communities. Some pay for engagement (yes, that's a thing).

The real question isn't ""should I use pods?"" It's ""how do I build genuine engagement that actually helps my content get seen?""

Because at the end of the day, LinkedIn is a meritocracy... with a really complex algorithm that favors early engagement.

Work with the system, not against it. Just don't be scammy about it.",SnooHabits754,1peus6n,SideProject,05-12-2025,14:15:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1peus6n/linkedin_influencers_dont_want_you_to_know_about/

For example it atm it helps tenants to create their profile from raw input, supports free-input searches, creates short summaries of applications and offers basic matching metrics etc... I still think there is room to use AI in more meaningful parts of the process.

An honor code violation pissed me off so I made an app to embarrass students submitting AI slop work.,"I taught a class for masters students and one student completely plagiarized her term paper and it was egregious. She was unrepentant when caught and, to be honest, I should have pushed harder for her to be failed. It completely took the wind out my sails for teaching more, and instances like this were one reason I opted not to try to become a professor after 6 years of grad school.

  
I needed an objective way to show that her work was probably not her own, so I made a web app (free to use, free forever) which takes a submitted document and automatically tests someone to see if they can recognize their own work from some synthetic alternatives.

"I analyzed 1,000+ live events to understand audience engagement patterns. Here's what nobody tells you.","Over the past 8 months, I've been tracking audience engagement data from live events, webinars, and virtual conferences. I'm talking about real-time interactions from over 1,000 events with audiences ranging from 50 to 5,000+ people.

I started this because I was frustrated running my own online workshops. Everyone talks about ""engaging your audience"" but nobody shares what actually works with data to back it up.

So I built a simple tool to track real-time audience reactions (claps, cheers, engagement moments) and convinced other event organizers to let me analyze their data too.

Some patterns were obvious. Others completely blew my mind.

The 5 Patterns That Actually Matter

1. The 3-Minute Window (This one shocked me)

If you don't get your audience to interact within the first 3 minutes, you've already lost 67% of potential engagement for the entire event.

Not 5 minutes. Not 10 minutes. THREE minutes.

The events with the highest overall engagement had their first interactive moment at an average of 2 minutes 14 seconds in.

2. The Sweet Spot Is 5-7 Moments

More interaction opportunities ≠ better engagement.

Events with 5-7 ""reaction moments"" throughout had 43% higher participation rates than those with 15+ moments.

Too many asks = audience fatigue = people zone out.

3. Visual Cues Beat Everything Else (By a LOT)

When speakers used visual prompts (""Click the clap button you see on screen""), participation jumped 3.4x compared to audio-only prompts (""Give us some applause"").

Simple change. Massive difference.

4. Tuesday 2-3pm Is the Golden Hour

Yeah, I know, everyone has scheduling theories. But the data is wild:

Tuesday 2-3pm: 89% average engagement rate

Wednesday 10-11am: 76% average engagement rate

Friday 3-5pm: 31% average engagement rate

RIP Friday afternoon events.

5. Early Momentum = Everything

This was the most predictable pattern: Events where 40%+ of the audience engaged in the first 10 minutes had 5.2x better overall participation than those below 40%.

Early energy is contagious. Dead starts are nearly impossible to recover from.

Some Context

I'm a developer who got tired of running webinars and having no idea if people were actually paying attention or just had the tab open in the background.

Built a tool called Hyperclapper (basically a real-time audience reaction system) for my own events. Other organizers started asking to use it. Suddenly I had access to way more data than I expected.

Still analyzing patterns and honestly finding new stuff every week.

What I'm Seeing by Industry

Tech/SaaS events: Highest engagement rates (avg 74%) but shortest attention spans Education/Training: Most consistent engagement throughout Corporate town halls: Lowest initial engagement (avg 41%) but improves if you nail the first 10 minutes Creative/Design events: Most enthusiastic reactions, highest ""clap per minute"" rates

The Stuff That Didn't Matter (Surprisingly)

Event length (30 min vs 90 min = no significant difference in engagement rates)

Production quality beyond ""decent"" (4K video didn't outperform 1080p)

Celebrity speakers (name recognition didn't guarantee engagement)

Happy to answer questions about:

Specific engagement strategies for different event types

Technical stuff about building real-time interaction tools

Data from specific industries or audience sizes

Why some ""best practices"" are complete BS

I'll be around for the next few hours to respond!

We built an AI messenger that learns from your chats to be your personal memory aid. Looking for feedback.,"Hey community,
I'm Sonny, one of the creators behind Chat10000. We're solving a problem I think many of you can relate to: the mental load of remembering countless details about the people you talk to.

You know that moment when you're chatting with a friend, and you blank on their recent vacation spot? Or when a colleague mentions a project, and you can't recall the key details? It happens to the best of us.

That's why we built Chat10000. It's an AI-powered messenger designed to be your second brain for communication.

How does it work?
* Learns as You Chat: Simply use Chat10000 to message your friends, family, and colleagues. Our AI (with full privacy controls, of course) quietly learns about the important things discussed – like names, preferences, projects, and key events.
* Builds Your Personal Memory: It automatically organizes this information into a secure, private ""memory bank"" that is unique to you.
* Helps You in Real-Time: When you're about to start a new conversation, Chat10000 can surface relevant context. For example: ""Remember, Sarah mentioned her presentation is on Friday."" Or, ""Tom's son, Leo, just started soccer practice.""

Key Features & What it does for you:
* Effortless Recall: Never scramble for details again. Have more meaningful and personalized conversations.
* Saves Mental Energy: Offload the work of remembering so you can be more present in the moment.
* Contextual Awareness: Get subtle, helpful hints based on who you're talking to and what you've discussed before.
* You're in Control: Your data is yours. You can view, edit, or delete any memory at any time.
Our goal is simple: to make communication feel effortless and thoughtful, not like a memory test.
We're currently in early stages and are actively looking for our first group of testers to help us shape the product. If this sounds like something you'd find useful, we'd be incredibly grateful for your feedback.

You can check out chat10000.

"It always starts with ""I have a dream to...""","During my teenage years, I used to have a lot of dreams and bucket list items I wanted to do but as I grew up and life hit me, they all kind of faded away and I didn't even know how my life become so mundane and boring. One day I know I needed a push.

Watching all these travel reels, people completing their bucket list items, doing adventures really made me feel alive again. That's when the idea for this app came to my mind. I needed a space where I can save all the things I wanted to do in life, some place where I can come to really feel alive that I have so much to do, so much to enjoy. I know I don't not want to make just a checklist app. I know it needed to be beautiful, fun and delight to use.

There is tasks where you can break you dreams into mini goals, document your journey with journal, add memories of completing your dream and relive it with detailed timeline of how you completed your dream.

What Really Helps directory Grow Safely and Steadily,"Today, I looked at the directory changes of about 15 brands that followed our basic directory-building method recently, and I noticed a clear trend that

Steady DR growth comes from having a good mix of listings, not from quick fixes.

Key findings from today’s data-

- Having listings in different industries, countries, and categories helps create safer DR.
- Google favors brands that are consistently found in many trusted places.
- DR grew faster when the first 200 listings were related to the niche.
- Sites with scattered or repeated listings made slower progress.
- Most ranking improvements came from the basics, not just from high-end backlinks.

This goes against what many founders think that one strong link will fix SEO problems. But today’s data showed otherwise.

What we changed today at [Directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org):

- Added new verified directories in SaaS, AI tools, tech, and marketing.
- Removed about 12 directories that lost value.
- Updated DR/DA checks in our internal tracker.
- Improved our approval verification process.
- Enhanced descriptions for better listing acceptance.
- Added region-specific directories for founders focusing on Western markets.

All these changes make sure that when founders build their foundation with us, they get steady and safe growth that builds up over time. 

If you want slow and stable DR growth instead of risky shortcuts, this basic approach will help.",Quiet_Composer_8622,1petxt2,SideProject,05-12-2025,13:34:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1petxt2/what_really_helps_directory_grow_safely_and/

I built Potato - an AI Meeting assistant that does useful stuff,"[https://meetpotato.com](https://meetpotato.com)

I've been working on Potato – an AI assistant that joins your calls and works alongside you during the meeting.

What it does:

* Paste a meeting link, a bot joins your call
* Automatically tracks agenda, decisions, and action items as people talk
* You can ask it questions mid-meeting and it researches answers live
* Can generate docs/forms/html mockups and images on the fly based on what's being discussed
* Everything streams to a real-time dashboard

No sign-up required – you can just paste a meeting link and try it.

Still early and rough around the edges.

Built an idea-scoring tool… now I can’t tell if the scoring actually makes sense. Thoughts?,"I just pushed a new idea-scoring feature into my project [SaaSThink](https://www.saasthink.app), and now I’m not sure if the scoring logic actually makes sense or if I just hallucinated confidence at 1am.

The concept is simple: type in a niche/problem and it scores how promising it is based on demand, trends, competition, etc. It sounded great in theory. But now that it’s live, I’m second-guessing everything.

For example: someone tried **“coffee subscription for remote teams”** and it scored surprisingly high… even though my quick research says barely anyone is looking for that.

  
Meanwhile, another niche with real search volume got a pretty average score. So now I’m wondering if it’s the inputs, the weighting, or just me pretending I understand markets better than I actually do.

It’s live and **free to try**... no DM needed.  
If anyone wants to poke at it, test a few niches, or just tell me whether the scoring feels useful, I’d seriously appreciate it.

If you’re up for deeper testing or more detailed feedback, DM me and I’ll send the tester coupon code in order to try the full analysis mode.

"I made natural language to insights platform (MSSQL, PostgresSQL, MySQL, csv, pdf, txt, etc.)","I've been working on VerbaGPT - a platform that lets you ask questions about your data in plain English and get back charts, tables, and analysis.

**The problem I'm solving:**

  \- 80% of people who need data insights can't write SQL or Python

  \- Generic LLMs don't understand your schema, column meanings, or business logic

  \- Most users don't know how to prompt effectively

**What it does:**

  \- Connect PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MSSQL databases

  \- Upload files: CSV, Excel, JSON, PDF, Word docs, or import from Google Drive

  \- Ask questions like ""What were our top products last quarter?"" → get instant charts and analysis

  \- Text-to-Python (not just SQL) - so you can do statistical modeling, ML, forecasting

**Two modes:**

  \- Virgo (cloud): Fast analytics in your browser, multi-model support (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)

  \- Taurus (local): Agentic workflows powered by Claude for complex, multi-step analysis

**Some features I'm excited about:**

  \- Data Notes: Automated data dictionary so the AI actually understands your schema

  \- Prompt Libraries: Share effective prompts org-wide (or license to clients)

  \- Smart schema selection: Embedding-based filtering so it only looks at relevant columns

* **Impermanent Loss Calculator** — for anyone LPing in DeFi who wants to know if fees actually offset the IL
* **House Hacking Calculator** — analyze multi-unit deals and see how rental income covers your mortgage

**File Tools:**

* PDF to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, images (and the reverse)
* Split, merge, sign, redact PDFs
* Image conversion between JPG/PNG/WebP/HEIC/GIF/BMP
* Audio conversion (MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, M4A)

* **Ebook Writer** — generate full ebooks with chapters and export to PDF/EPUB

**Tech stack:** Next.js, WebAssembly for the heavy lifting, Ollama integration for local AI. Dark theme because I'm not a monster.

I built a 100% static SEO article generator because I couldn’t find anything that fit my needs,"Salut,

Aujourd'hui, la plupart des outils d'écriture d'IA sont des produits SaaS traditionnels :  
backend requis, comptes d'utilisateurs, stockage côté serveur, journalisation, métriques et gestion parfois opaque des clés API.

Ce n'est pas ce que je voulais.

Je recherchais un outil entièrement statique, facile à auto-héberger, ne nécessitant aucun backend, ne stockant aucune donnée côté serveur, n'ayant aucun suivi, conservant ma clé API dans le navigateur uniquement, doté d'une interface utilisateur propre et produisant du Markdown pur au lieu d'un texte d'IA générique.

Je n'ai rien trouvé qui corresponde à ce dont j'avais besoin,  
j'ai donc fini par le construire moi-même : **OpenSEO Studio**.

# OpenSEO Studio – Statique, BYOK, rédacteur SEO open source

* Fonctionne entièrement dans le navigateur (HTML/CSS/JS uniquement)
* Pas de backend, pas de base de données, pas de métriques
* BYOK via OpenRouter
* Chargement dynamique du modèle (basé sur votre clé API)
* Sortie Markdown uniquement
* Interface utilisateur sombre et moderne
* Licence MIT

**GitHub :**  
[ https://github.com/Vellis59/openseo-studio ](https://github.com/Vellis59/openseo-studio)

**Démo en direct  :**  
 [https://openseostudio.localhosted.io/](https://openseostudio.localhosted.io/)

# Ce qui est déjà disponible (v0.7)

# ✔ Flux de travail en 3 étapes

1. Aperçu généré par l'IA (H1/H2/H3)
2. Réviser et ajuster
3. Générez l'article complet

# ✔ Éditeur Markdown + aperçu en direct

# ✔ Panneau Paramètres (options avancées)

* BYOK (OpenRouter)
* Mode anonyme (pas de stockage local)
* Mot de passe principal (cryptage local)
* Chargement dynamique du modèle
* Mode Expert (température, jetons, top-p, etc.)

# ✔ Préréglages intégrés

Guide, Article long, Tutoriel, Comparaison, Listicle, Actualités

# ✔ Modes d'invite

* Standard \* Minimal (amélioration actuelle de la qualité et de la cohérence des invites)

# ✔ Options supplémentaires

* Ajouter une table des matières Markdown
* Exporter la configuration (JSON)
* Importer la configuration
* Réinitialiser le stockage local

L'application est entièrement fonctionnelle et déjà utilisable pour les flux de travail d'écriture quotidiens.

# Feuille de route

# Je travaille actuellement sur :

* amélioration de la structure des invites pour des articles plus propres
* affiner le comportement prédéfini
* amélioration du mode d'invite standard
* Perfectionnement UX sur l'éditeur + mise en page d'aperçu

# Prochaines étapes :

* export multiformat (Markdown, HTML épuré, éventuellement MDX)
* Améliorations continues de la qualité des invites longues

# À la recherche de commentaires

J'apprécierais des réflexions sur :

* l'approche 100% statique / BYOK
* Clarté UX
* structure rapide
* l'interface utilisateur des paramètres avancés
* si le système de préréglage est utile ou doit aller plus loin

Tout retour, positif ou négatif, est le bienvenu.

I built a CLI that extracts structured metadata from React/TypeScript codebases - looking for feedback,"Hi guys :)



I built a small CLI that turns any React/TypeScript project into a set of context.json bundle files (plus a main index).



These bundles include:

\- Component contracts: name, paths, props (TS inferred), hooks, state, exports

\- Dependencies: components used/using it, external imports, circular deps

\- Behavior hints: data fetching, navigation, event handlers

\- Docs: JSDoc, comments, auto summaries

\- Next.js aware: pages, layouts, client/server components

\- UI Style metadata: Tailwind, Material UI (sx/Box/Stack), Radix UI, ShadCN, inline styles

\- Token estimates + folder indexes in context\_main.json



It works well on medium-sized projects and helps with understanding a codebase’s structure and dependencies.

I made an app to lock my phone before bed because my sleep was getting wrecked. Would love some honest feedback,"So this started as a personal project because my sleep was falling apart and I realized that the main reason was my phone.

* 1 hour before that, your distracting apps get locked
* it shows a wind-down screen

I’ve been building a gamified productivity platform for a few months here’s the progress so far + what I’ve learned,"Hey everyone,  
For the past few months I’ve been working on a side project called **Habit Jungle**, and I wanted to share a bit of the journey and get some thoughts from other builders here.

The idea started because my friend and I kept bouncing between different apps one for habits, one for planning, another for Pomodoro sessions and everything useful seemed to be behind a paywall. We thought it would be fun (and maybe useful) to try making an all in one version ourselves.

We ended up building a gamified system with habits, to-dos, daily/yearly planning, a deep focus timer, XP + coins, cosmetics, rankings, leaderboards… basically way more than we originally planned 😅

Some things we’ve learned so far:

* Designing something that feels simple *despite* having lots of features is insanely difficult.
* Mobile responsiveness across every weird screen size takes more time than expected.
* Gamification works even small XP rewards motivated early users way more than we thought.
* Sharing progress early helped way more than keeping everything “secret until finished.”

Some challenges:

* Keeping the XP/coin system fun without letting users exploit it.
* Balancing visual style between “fun game” and “serious productivity tool.”
* Firebase occasionally testing my patience lol.

why every founder ends up with 200 bookmarks and no flow,"Last year, my browser history looked like I was a detective instead of running a startup. Some days, I saved 10 tools, and other days I opened 40 tabs to compare similar products. Most of the time, I used none of them. 

The problem is that we have many tools but no clear way to use them. There are AI tools, design services, and freelancers, but everything feels messy and overwhelming. 

At one point, I saw my desktop filled with:

- 7 Notion pages called “Tools to try”

- 28 bookmarks of AI tools I forgot about

- 3 pages of freelancers I wanted to hire but lost track of

- random screenshots of resources I wanted to check later

I had no real clarity. That was my breaking point. I didn’t need more tools; I needed a single place to find them. 

So, I created a simple directory for myself. It’s clean, easy to update, and helps founders quickly find AI tools, SaaS products, freelancers, and services all in one place. This became [Bigblackfriday.sale](http://bigblackfriday.sale). 

It’s not a fancy marketplace or a list of “best tools.” It’s just an organized version of all my messy bookmarks. The great part is that people can list their tools or services for free or for a fee, so founders can discover them and be discovered too.

Many other founders shared my struggle, saying, “We have too many tools but no structure.” 

Bigblackfriday.sale is my way of solving this. It doesn’t just pick the “best” tools; it brings them together so we can stop wasting time searching and start building.

 If it helps you avoid having 200 useless bookmarks, then I’ve succeeded.",myjeffreyjefferson,1pey1ts,SideProject,05-12-2025,16:31:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pey1ts/why_every_founder_ends_up_with_200_bookmarks_and/

"I built GoodWatch - Tinder for movies (free, no signup)","

After spending 30 minutes choosing a movie on Netflix last Friday and ending up watching nothing, I built GoodWatch.



It's basically Tinder for movies:

1. Tell us your mood (romantic, thrilling, need a laugh, etc.)

2. Swipe through 10 AI-picked movies

3. Watch the one you like



No signup. No BS. Just: [goodwatch.movie](http://goodwatch.movie)



Built it in a weekend because I was tired of decision fatigue. If even one person avoids Netflix paralysis because of this, I'm happy.

"I built a ""Pretotype"" YouTube Comment Finder to finally solve bad native search. Does this look useful?","I've always found YouTube's native search impossible for digging up specific information or tracking comments on a video.

I made an iOS app for my daughter to practice her math tables and launched v2 yesterday,"Hey everyone!

Last school year I built a small iOS app for my daughter to practice her multiplication tables. It started as a quick side project, but over the past ten months a lot of other kids ended up using it too.

I finally gave it the proper update it deserved and just launched Table Champion 2.0. The whole app has been redesigned and generally feels much more polished and fun.

If you want to try it out, the upgrade to the full version is **free until Sunday**.

"I built a free tool to help freelancers protect their work from client theft (and avoid the ""email chain"" hell)","I’ve been working as a freelance graphic designer for a while, and I noticed a recurring problem in the industry: The Delivery Gap.

When sending near-final work to clients for approval, you have two bad options:

1. **Send a low-res JPEG:** Looks unprofessional, and clients still try to use it.
2. **Send a high-res PDF:** Risky. Clients can take the file and ghost you without paying.
3. **Watermark manually:** Tedious and ruins the presentation.

I looked for a simple, free tool to handle this professionally but only found expensive enterprise software or clunky file transfer sites.

**So, I built SignOffPro.**

It’s a simple web tool designed to bridge the gap between ""sending a screenshot"" and ""using Adobe Enterprise.""

**What it does:**

* 🛡️ **Protection:** Disables right-click/save and adds an automatic watermark to your uploads.
* 🎨 **Presentation:** Shows your work in a clean, branded viewer (not an email attachment).
* 💬 **Feedback:** Clients can tap anywhere on the image to leave specific comments (no more ""make the logo pop"" emails).
* 📱 **Mobile Friendly:** Works great on phones for clients on the go.

**The best part? It is 100% Free.**  
This is a side project I built to solve my own headache, and I decided to open it up to the community. No paywalls, no ads.

I’d love for you guys to roast my landing page or give me feedback on the UI.

"I don't think it's because you're not motivated enough. You just need to find something with a very clear scope that you can do every day, until the process becomes autopilot","Currently I speak around 5 languages (some are fluent, some are just conversational level). People often find this impressive because, naturally, it takes a lot of time and effort to learn them one by one. They are usually quite surprised when I tell them that I learn mainly from Duolingo.

*(By the way, this post is definitely not an advertisement for Duolingo at all! They are obviously a huge company that doesn't need to post on Reddit to advertise their business, you all know them already. I just wanted to share my personal experience on how having a clear, simple goal makes consistency feel effortless)*

After talking with my friends, I realized that it worked for me because I spent around 45 minutes (almost) every day consistently, instead of just five minutes like most people.

Doing 45 minutes sounds like a lot, but honestly it is quite simple. Since the structure and materials are already laid out in front of me, I don't need to use my brain and mental power to research what topics to learn or how to organize my study. I just simply execute whatever that is given to me.

I have a very clear target of 10 lessons per day.

That's simply it! Because I know I just need to finish those 10 lessons and then I am free, I can do it consistently without stress. I don't have to spend any mental energy, I just execute on autopilot.

Of course this Duolingo thing is just an example, you should find a way to apply something similar for your own case when building your own service. Honestly if you don't mind posting what you're trying to achieve, I might help with brainstorming on what simple things you can do daily to go closer to your goals!",bronzebrownie_,1pex0c7,SideProject,05-12-2025,15:50:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pex0c7/i_dont_think_its_because_youre_not_motivated/

For years, we’ve been consuming more video than ever…

Scrubbing timelines.  
Skipping 10 seconds.  
Hunting for that “somewhere around here” moment.

It’s very early.  
Rough edges everywhere.

Right now, you can upload up to 3 short videos (under 100MB or 15 mins, whichever you reach first). There are limitations on embeddings, tokenization and video key frame analysis as this is a FREE service for now.

"After managing 12 side projects, I built a tool to track what actually matters","I have a confession: I'm terrible at SEO.

Not because I don't understand it, but because I never had a system. My ""backlink strategy"" was:

1. Find a directory
2. Submit my project
3. Forget about it
4. Repeat

Sound familiar?

After one year of this chaos, I finally built something to fix it: **MyBacklinks.app**

**What it does:**

✅ **Backlink Resource Library** - Save all the directories, forums, and sites where you can submit. Track DR, traffic, payment type.

✅ **Discovery** - Enter your domain, get a list of all sites linking to you (via API)

✅ **Traffic Attribution** - See which backlinks actually send visitors

✅ **Multi-project Dashboard** - Because one side project is never enough 😄

Free tier available (3 projects, 100 resources).

Ultimate Tool for Making Beautiful Screenshots & Device Mockups - Now with video support 🎬,"Hey everyone!

I’ve been building PostSpark, a tool for creating beautiful mockups. I recently realized that static mockups aren’t always enough to grab attention, so I spent some time adding full **Video & Animations** support!

The goal is to let you turn a screen recording or screenshot into a high-quality promo video in seconds.

✨ **What’s New (shown in the video):**  
🎬 **Video Support:** Drop in a screen recording, place it inside device frames, and export as video.  
⚡️ **Auto-Backgrounds:** The app automatically extracts colors from your screenshot and generates a matching background.  
🎥 **Keyframe Animations:** A simple timeline editor to add zooms, pans, and 3D movements to your mockups.

And of course, all the core features are still there:  
• 30+ Devices and Frames (Browser, iPhone, Android, etc.)  
• URL-to-Screenshot capture  
• Annotation tools

You can try the new features here: [https://postspark.app/screenshot](https://postspark.app/screenshot)
