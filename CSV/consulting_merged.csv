"In this Slough hospital, nobody washes their hands. It’s for health reasons","https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/12/03/wexham-park-hospital-slough-banned-sinks/


>Intensive care unit consultant Dr Karim Fouad Alber had a few questions when he and his colleagues were asked by his hospital to start washing their hands less. “Multiple,” he acknowledges, politely.. Understandably, he was tentative. The guidance contradicts everything he had ever been trained to do, even though **the replacement advice was to use repeated hand sanitiser instead of washing**. “Initially, I was slightly slow to take it up – I used to wash my hands as I normally did,” he admits. “Until the sinks were taped over.” Taped over, and then removed.

>**To be exact, 23 sinks have been removed in his ICU at Slough’s Wexham Park Hospital, and 108 sinks have been removed from across the hospital as a whole over the past year**. They have been taken from nine wards, including two elderly care wards and the Eden Day Unit oncology ward. Eventually, it is possible that up to 80 per cent of the hospital’s sinks will be removed across the whole site, which is part of the Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust. In the end, the only ones likely to be left will be those in toilet facilities. In its sister hospital, Frimley Park, work is even starting to remove sinks in the neonatal ward.


> according to Dr Manjula Meda, the consultant clinical microbiologist who is behind this startling pulling of the plug. In a first for a UK hospital, following the introduction of similar practices in the Netherlands and Germany, the move is actually part of a landmark “water-safe” initiative designed to protect patients against antimicrobial-resistant superbugs – bugs that are increasingly resistant to antibiotics.
**Sinks, drains, waste pipes and, by extension, handwashing**, when it is done badly – which, apparently, it is 95 per cent of the time – **are the key harbourers and spreaders of this potentially fatal bacteria**. Few of us wash for the 20 seconds required to be effective.

>You get the impression that they've become accustomed to persuading doubters. **“Water and wastewater are reservoirs of bacteria… It’s an Amazon rainforest in drain systems,” she says. “We know when people wash hands or go to the toilet bugs are going… into drain systems. But until now, we’ve never appreciated the fact that they travel from drains to patients.”**


Who knew washing your hands could be so dangerous?! ",FlockBoySlim,1pczv8r,hygiene,03-12-2025,09:35:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/hygiene/comments/1pczv8r/in_this_slough_hospital_nobody_washes_their_hands/

"Looking for a good, affordable dermatologist in Delhi (student here )🙏","Hi everyone,
I’m a student in Delhi and currently dealing with some skin issues. I’m looking for recommendations for a reliable dermatologist who is:
	•	Patient and takes time to listen
	•	Doesn’t push unnecessary medicines or expensive treatments

I’d really like to get real recommendations based on personal experience rather than just clinic names.

If you’ve visited a good dermatologist in Delhi and had positive results, please share the doctor’s name, clinic location, consultation fee (approx), and your experience.

Suspected ADHD,"Hi. Just wanted to hear your thoughts about my situation. Recently, I got an HR interview and felt that I bombed it because of how the interview went. Several questions asked were not answered clearly. I've realized that I always have a hard time putting my thoughts into words which lead me to search and read in Reddit. Most comments said that they were diagnosed with ADHD so I searched the symptoms in Google. Most of the symptoms describe me.

- Day dream a lot
- Struggle putting my thoughts into words
-  Stuttering/ speaking fast
- Easily forget/missing things
- Things are always not organized on a daily basis 
- At night, thoughts ko ay gumagana
- While at work, easily distracted ako 
- Interrupting or finishing other's sentence

More or less, these are the symptoms na usually kong na-eexperience and nasasabi sakin ng ibang tao which is why I suspected that I have ADHD. I'm an introverted person and diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depression last 2023 but hindi na ako nakapagcontinue ng medication because of how expensive it is. I'm thinking that maybe I have those symptoms because of my introverted personality and, growing up, I hardly speak about our emotions inside the household. 

Can you please share your thoughts about this? Ang mahal kasi talaga ng consultation and medications for mental health problems in PH and maintaining it. Thank you so much!

Double eyelid surgery,"Hi! I’m flying to Korea next week (12/8-12/25) to hopefully get double eyelid surgery. I’ve confirmed consultations with Luho Plastic Surgery and Respect Plastic Surgery so far and am trying to confirm for Pop Plastic Surgery as well. I’ve done some basic online consultations with all these places and they all seem to recommend incisional with ptosis corrections. I’m conflicted between incisional and non-incisional, but open to both. I think I mainly just like how non-incisional is not permanent (in case something goes wrong), which is why I think I’d prefer incisional but also I like the idea of incisional is permanent so I wouldn’t have to go back to fix my life if they become undone. Right now my dilemma is- many of the clinics seem to be full, as apparently December is peak season to book surgeries. Does anyone have any input/personal experience for any of the clinics mentioned above? I also would like to add that I looked into Wink Plastic Surgery, as I liked how there was only one doctor and this clinic seemed to be known for eye surgeries. But it seems now they have a new doctor in addition to the one already there. They said they have one opening for 12/24, but I leave Korea on 12/25 and want to have the doctor that did my surgery check up on me, which is why I ultimately decided to not proceed with Wink. But I just wanted to know if there’s any information that anyone can comment about Wink in case I postpone my surgery to next year. 

I’d also like to mention that i’m hoping to get an outline crease. ",cupcake5523,1pczryn,SeoulPlasticSurgery,03-12-2025,09:29:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeoulPlasticSurgery/comments/1pczryn/double_eyelid_surgery/
Will workplace pension contributions disqualify me from ILR under new Earned Settlement rules?,"I'm feeling quite anxious about the proposed changes to the ILR route and hoping others might be in a similar situation or have insight.

Background

* **Visa:** Skilled Worker (arrived Nov 2021)
* **Projected ILR application:** Nov 2026
* **Nationality:** Canadian passport holder
* **Employment:** Same company, same job code for 5 years (very stable employment history)

Salary history

* Apr 2023: £51,000
* Jun 2024 - present: £52,530
* Projected salary at application: £52,530

The proposed Earned Settlement criteria states: *""Applicant has earned a taxable income of £50,270 for 3 years immediately prior to applying for settlement""*

I contribute 5% to my workplace pension, which brings my calculation to:

* Gross salary: £52,530
* Pension (5%): £2,626.50
* **Taxable income: £49,903.50**

This puts me **£366.50 short** of the threshold, despite earning well above it.

1. **Is anyone else in this boat?** Where your only deduction is a workplace pension contribution, which is literally a positive thing (saving for retirement, reducing burden on state), yet it potentially disqualifies you from settlement?
2. **If these new rules pass, do I have a reasonable chance of being approved anyway?** My gross salary is above £50,270, I've been with the same employer in the same role for 5 years, and I'm clearly not a burden on the system.
3. **Should I reduce my pension contribution to 4% to be safe?** It feels ridiculous to have to choose between saving for retirement and securing settlement, but here we are.
4. **Has anyone heard anything about transitional arrangements** for those of us already in the system? I've been here since 2021 and followed all the rules, only to potentially have the goalposts moved.

I'm genuinely stressed about this. On paper I do everything right - stable job, good salary, contributing to a pension - but a technicality might derail everything.

Anyone else navigating this? Any advice would be massively appreciated.

*Note: I know the consultation is still ongoing and nothing is final yet, but the proposed April 2026 implementation is cutting it very close to my application date.*

Getting blamed for mould. 2 year old in respiratory distress.,"I have what I believe to be penetrating damp in both my bedrooms. Water is ingressing through the wall during rain and my bedrooms do not retain warmth.. they fall to 2 degrees over night with the heating on full. My windows often freeze. 

Due to this we are overcome with black mould. It is in our carpets, on our bedframes, in our mattress and soft furnishings and rotting bedroom furniture.

My housing association are blaming my fishtank that is situated in my living room (43% humidity and no mould), and the self condensing tumble dryer in my airing cupboard again no mould. 

I have sent them weeks of medical evidence dr notes explaining how it’s affecting my own health as someone who has nocturnal seizures and is sleeping on a mattress pressed against a sofa. I am at a high risk of suffocating like this during a seizure. 

They have also had letter from 4 different doctors and consultants on how the issue has affected my 2 year old with respiratory issues. 

I have documented the decline in her health to them (multiple medication increases within a month), and had no follow up. She went into respiratory distress over the weekend and was coughing up lots of red blood. She was blue lighted to hospital. 

I am at my wits end. I don’t know what to do to get them to listen I’ve made nearly 50 phone calls, 20 emails documenting everything and requests for help and now. I have contacted my local councillor and MP but all my housing association can offer me everything I call is a surveyor attending and no follow up to that.

I Built an AI Agent System - Looking for 5 Businesses,"Over the past 6 months, I've been building a multi agent AI system that handles lead qualification, outbound prospecting, and call setting for sales teams. I need 5 businesses to test it at scale across different industries.  
**The Problem**

Most businesses lose 40 - 60% of their leads because:

* Response time is too slow (leads go cold within 5 minutes)
* Manual followups are inconsistent
* You can't afford a full sales team
* Evenings and weekends = lost opportunities

Your competitors with bigger teams are eating your lunch while you're stuck doing admin work.

# What the System Does

1. Inbound Agent: Responds to inquiries in under 60 seconds, qualifies based on your criteria, books meetings on your calendar
2. Outbound Agent: Researches prospects, sends personalized sequences, follows up 5 - 7 times automatically
3. Calling Agent: Makes qualification calls, handles objections, transfers hot leads to you
4. Full Integration: Works with your existing CRM, calendar, email, and phone system

# Target Industries

Staffing & Recruitment Firms: Automate candidate outreach, pre-screening, and interview scheduling. Built for firms placing 10+ candidates/month.​

B2B Manufacturing: Handle RFQ responses, qualify buyers by budget/timeline, nurture 6 - 12 month sales cycles.​

Real Estate Agents/Teams: Instant response to property inquiries, buyer qualification, automated showing bookings.​

Mortgage Brokers & Lenders: Pre qualify leads, send rate scenarios, collect documents, book consultation calls 24/7.​

# The Beta Program ($500 for 7-Day Trial)

Step 1: Free 30min demo session where I show you:

* Live walkthrough of the AI agents in action.
* How it integrates with your current tech stack.
* Custom automation opportunities for your specific business.
* Q&A and fit assessment.

Step 2: If we're aligned, I build your custom MVP in 3 days for $500

Step 3: You test it with real leads for 7 days

Step 4: Love it? We move to production. Not satisfied? Full refund.

# Qualification Requirements (Please Read Before Applying)

I'm only taking 5 clients and need specific criteria

1. Revenue: $10K+/month.
2. Lead Volume: Minimum 20+ leads per month you're currently handling manually. 
3. Existing Process: You have a sales process that works, we're automating it, not building from scratch.

Timeline: Ready to implement within 2 weeks of demo session​  
Industry Diversity: Taking max 2 clients per industry for testing purposes

# Who This Is NOT For

* Startups with no revenue or leads yet
* People who want to ""explore options"" for 3 months
* Businesses expecting zero setup effort
* Anyone thinking AI will magically fix a broken sales funnel​

# How to Apply

If you want in,  
DM ""BETA"" and I'll send the Demo Session Link.

Taking only 5 clients total selecting based on business fit and industry diversity.​​  
What you'll walk away with after the demo:

* Even if we don't work together, you'll see exactly how AI agents can be deployed in your business​
* A free audit of your current sales process and automation opportunities​
* Clear understanding of ROI potential for your specific situation​

Note: This is a legitimate beta test. I need real world data from multiple industries running simultaneously.

Political/Policy professional considering part time MBA (UChicago or Kellogg),"Hi all,

Using a throwaway account for this. I’m a 31 yr old male considering applying to part time MBA programs next admission cycle. 

Looking specifically at UChicago Booth and Kellogg. Curious to know my chances and any advice from any current part time MBA’s. 

My background:

Have worked in politics for about 6 years, have raised millions of dollars for campaigns, and most recently was a campaign manager for a competitive congressional campaign. 

Went and got a Masters at Harvard (an MPP) and had experience while there interning at a Fortune 5 doing healthcare work (think value based care).  

I also was a consultant for a voter registration nonprofit, helping them rethink their growth strategy. 

I’d like to leverage a part time MBA to eventually work strategy at a philanthropic organization or a nonprofit (think CoS or other strategy type roles). 

Also curious about Bridgespan/Redstone Strategy type roles, and curious if folks have used a part time MBA to transition to social sector consulting. 

GRE score - 320 (but would like to retake)

Curious to hear y’all’s thoughts! 

Thanks. ",PerpetualTraveler94,1pcznxq,MBA,03-12-2025,09:22:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1pcznxq/politicalpolicy_professional_considering_part/

	•	Anything that helped you get familiar with systemic therapies, cancer pathways, or oncology emergencies?

2) Shortlisting Scores
	•	Roughly what was your shortlisting score when you applied?
	

3) Demonstrating Commitment

Since my current portfolio isn’t oncology-focused, what can I realistically start doing over the next year?
I’m considering:
	•	Attending oncology clinics (medical + nurse-led)
	•	Getting involved in audits/QI projects related to cancer care
	•	Joining MDTs, shadowing consultants, or even attending local teaching sessions
	•	Anything else that shows genuine commitment and boosts my chances?

Would love to hear from current ST3+ Medical Oncology trainees or anyone who has been through the process. Any tips or insights would be super helpful!

Thanks in advance 😊

A major strength is its **dual-country compliance**:

* Supports **Malaysia LHDN e-Invoice**
* Supports **Singapore Peppol InvoiceNow**

Other useful tools include automated bank reconciliation, OCR document scanning, and integration with **Financio Payroll** for HR management.

While MYOB is solid, it tends to be less optimized for Malaysian-specific workflows compared to SQL or AutoCount. The 7-day trial is short but lets you evaluate core features.

**Key Features:**

* ✅ Compliant with Malaysia's LHDN e-Invoice system
* ✅ Compliant with Singapore's Peppol InvoiceNow network
* ✅ Automated bank reconciliation
* ✅ AI-powered OCR scanning
* ✅ Financio payroll integration
* ✅ International brand recognition
* ✅ 7-day free trial available
* ⚠️ Less tailored to Malaysian-specific needs compared to SQL/AutoCount

# 5. [Million Accounting Software](https://www.million.my/)

>**Best for:** Small businesses with basic needs and very tight budgets

>**Pricing:** From **RM1,499** (one-time payment) 

**What it offers:**

Million Accounting Software covers basic accounting with Malaysian SST compliance, multi-user support so your team can collaborate, and standard financial reporting suitable for micro-SMEs. 

However, **e-Invoice is NOT included** in the base license — it requires additional purchase.  
It also lacks modern features such as mobile apps, OCR scanning, AI tools, or advanced inventory support.

The smaller market presence means fewer consultants, limited community support, and fewer updates compared to the major players.

**Key Features:**

* ✅ Basic Malaysian SST compliance
* ✅ Multi-user support
* ✅ Standard financial reporting
* ⚠️ E-Invoice does not include in purchase license
* ⚠️ Limited features compared to others
* ⚠️ Smaller support network and fewer resources

This is just my personal opinion. Every software has its strengths — there’s no absolute “best” or “worst” software — the right choice depends entirely on your business needs.",Virtual-Star392,1pczmve,AcctSoftwareTalk,03-12-2025,09:20:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcctSoftwareTalk/comments/1pczmve/top_5_best_budget_accounting_software_in_malaysia/
"C_TADM_23 Exam Retiring on December 31, 2025: Should You Take It Now?","Recently, many candidates have asked an important question: “**Since the C\_TADM\_23 exam will be retired on December 31, 2025, can I still take it to extend my certification? Will the certification remain valid after the retirement date?**” These are common concerns, especially with SAP’s updated certification validity model. The short answer is **yes - if you take and pass the exam before the retirement date, your certification will continue to be valid for an additional 12 months**, but the full details deserve a closer look.

The C\_TADM\_23 SAP Certified Technology Consultant – SAP S/4HANA System Administration exam has long been a respected credential for SAP BASIS administrators and technical consultants. With SAP announcing its retirement on December 31, 2025, candidates must decide whether they should pursue this certification now or wait for a future version.

# What Does “Exam Retirement” Mean?

When SAP retires an exam, it simply means:

* You cannot take the exam after the retirement date.
* Learning content may stop receiving updates.
* A newer or updated certification is often introduced later.

However, retirement does not mean the certification instantly becomes worthless. SAP has a clear policy:

If you hold a valid certificate on the retirement date, the certificate stays valid for 12 additional months beyond the retirement date.

That means if you pass C\_TADM\_23 before December 31, 2025, your certification will remain valid until at least December 31, 2026.

# Will Your C_TADM_23 Certification Still Be Valid After 2025?

**Yes - absolutely.**

As long as you earn the certification before December 31, 2025, SAP considers your certificate valid for one more full year, even though the exam itself is no longer offered.

This is aligned with SAP's new certification model introduced in 2024, which requires:

* Time-limited certification validity
* Annual “stay certified” assessments to remain active
* After the 12-month post-retirement window, you may be required to:
* Complete a yearly assessment (if SAP continues to support it), or
* Earn the new successor certification when SAP releases it

Either way, you will still hold a legitimate, recognized SAP certification for at least one full year after December 2025.

# Is It Worth Taking C_TADM_23 Before It Retires?

**Yes - and here's why.**

Despite its upcoming retirement, C\_TADM\_23 is still an excellent certification for SAP BASIS and system administration professionals. Here are the biggest reasons to take it now:

**1. It Remains Highly Relevant to SAP S/4HANA Administration**

The exam covers real-world skills used daily by administrators:

* SAP S/4HANA system architecture
* SAP HANA database administration
* Client and user management
* Transport management (CTS & CTS+)
* System monitoring and troubleshooting
* SAP system installation and upgrades

These topics apply to current SAP environments and remain valuable even when the certification version changes.

**2. You Earn a Valid SAP Certification for 12+ Months**

Passing before the deadline grants you:

* A globally recognized SAP certificate
* A digital badge
* Validity through 2026, even after exam retirement
* Stronger credentials for job applications and promotions

This gives you a solid time window to leverage the certification.

**3. The Current Exam Is Well-Documented and Familiar**

Because C\_TADM\_23 has been available for a while:

* Training materials are abundant
* Community resources, guides, and practice questions are widely available
* Instructors are familiar with the content
* The exam format is predictable

This makes preparing easier than waiting for a new, updated exam with unknown content.

**4. It Helps You Prepare for Future Successor Certifications**

If SAP releases a new version, having C\_TADM\_23 will make transitioning easier. Your foundational knowledge will already be strong.

**5. Great Option for SAP BASIS Professionals Starting Now**

If you're currently entering or advancing in SAP technical administration, earning this certification immediately boosts your credibility.

Employers recognize that version-specific admin skills (HANA, SUM, SWPM, STMS, etc.) do not change dramatically over short periods.

# Reasons You Might Wait Instead

Although taking the exam now is a strong choice, here are situations where you may prefer to wait:

* You expect SAP to release a newer, longer-validity successor soon
* You want the most future-proof certification possible
* Your company plans to upgrade to a new SAP technology baseline

However, SAP often takes months to years to release new certification versions, and newer exams are usually more difficult in the first year.

# Who Should Definitely Take C_TADM_23 Now?

You should strongly consider taking the exam before retirement if you are:

* A current or aspiring SAP BASIS administrator
* Working with SAP S/4HANA systems
* Looking to strengthen your technical resume quickly
* Planning to apply for technical SAP roles in 2025–2026
* Wanting to qualify for higher-level SAP certifications later

# Should You Take It Now?

**Yes - if you're already preparing or working in SAP technical administration, take C\_TADM\_23 now.**

You will:

* Secure a valid SAP certification before it retires
* Enjoy certification benefits through at least the end of 2026
* Build essential SAP BASIS and S/4HANA admin skills
* Be better positioned for successor certifications
* Strengthen your career prospects immediately

Waiting for the next version may only delay your career growth - especially since C\_TADM\_23 remains highly relevant and widely recognized.",hotitcertnews,1pczlly,HotITCertNews,03-12-2025,09:17:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotITCertNews/comments/1pczlly/c_tadm_23_exam_retiring_on_december_31_2025/
"#METAD—Imensional Expansion🌀| Human Consciousness Comes From a Higher Dimension, Scientist Claims—Meaning It Could Transcend the Physical World (6 min read) | Popular Mechanics: Consciousness [Nov 2025]","# 🌀 #METAD—Imensional Expansion

>*What the article implies — and what a #METAD model makes explicit*

The Popular Mechanics piece gestures toward a bold proposition:  
**Consciousness may not arise within three-dimensional space at all — the brain may function as a receiver, tuner, and translator of a higher-dimensional field.**

Here is the expanded #METAD interpretation:

# 🧠 1. Consciousness as a Hyperdimensional Field Interface

Rather than being *generated* by the brain, consciousness may be a **field phenomenon** extending into dimensions beyond space–time.  
The brain then acts as:

* a **biological aerial** (with neural oscillations acting as tuning frequencies)
* a **waveguide** for higher-dimensional signal flow
* a **compressor** translating hyperdimensional information into 3D perception

This aligns naturally with:

* theta–gamma phase-coupling during mystical states
* endogenous DMT modulation
* EEG evidence of increased signal diversity under psychedelics
* dream–lucidity transitions and near-death experiences

# 🌌 2. Higher Dimensions Fit the Lived Phenomenology

If consciousness operates through extra dimensions, several human experiences become coherent rather than anomalous:

* encounters with entities during DMT states
* fractal and geometric visions
* synchronicity cascades
* out-of-body perceptual shifts
* the sense of stepping “outside time”

Mathematically, these map more cleanly onto higher-dimensional structures than onto 3D neurochemistry alone.

# 🧩 3. Psychedelics Momentarily Loosen 3D Filtering

Psychedelics may not produce “hallucinations.”  
Instead, they may **reduce the brain’s dimensional filtering** — akin to removing compression on a complex signal.  
This would reveal:

* higher-dimensional patterning
* database-like informational strata
* temporarily expanded non-local cognition

This provides a rigorous explanatory framework for “downloads” and sudden insights.

# 🔬 4. Where Empirical Evidence Might Arise

Even if consciousness itself cannot yet be isolated instrumentally, physics may soon validate the **dimensional architecture** required for it:

* **DUNE 2028** (sterile neutrinos → evidence for additional dimensions)
* upgraded gravitational-wave interferometry
* hidden-sector particle searches (dark photons, axion-like fields)
* refined neurobiological studies of Schumann resonance coupling

Should extra dimensions be empirically confirmed, consciousness-as-field moves from speculation to scientific plausibility.

# 🧭 5. Why This Matters

This reframes the entire debate:  
❌ Consciousness as an inexplicable by-product of neurons  
→  
✔️ Consciousness as the *interface layer* between biological matter and a wider, hyperdimensional informational ecosystem.

For those exploring meditation, psychedelics, mystical cognition, psi, and advanced states of awareness, this framework provides a unifying map linking experience with frontier physics.
______

# The #METAD View Within the [Unified Cosmic → Atomic Field System](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeuronsToNirvana/comments/1jwk099/unified_cosmic_to_atomic_field_system_a/)

>*How higher-dimensional consciousness integrates into a four-field unified map of reality*

The Popular Mechanics article hints at higher-dimensional consciousness.  
The #METAD model takes this further by placing it inside a **unified four-field architecture**:

**1. Cosmic Field** (macro, relativistic, gravitational)  
**2. Quantum Field** (micro, probabilistic, entangled)  
**3. Cellular–Biofield** (mitochondrial, EM, fascia–piezoelectric)  
**4. Consciousness Field** (hyperdimensional, non-local, informational)

Where conventional science treats these levels as separate, the #METAD approach treats them as **nested layers of one continuum**.

# 🔷 1. Cosmic Field → Consciousness Field

If extra spatial dimensions exist, consciousness may operate through the *upper layers* of this structure.  
In this model:

* consciousness is not confined within the skull
* it is a **non-local field** entangled with space–time geometry
* the brain is a **translator**, not an origin point
* synchronicity arises from cross-level coupling between timelines

This naturally explains why deep mystical or psychedelic states feel “cosmic” in scope.

# 🔷 2. Quantum Field → Consciousness Field

Quantum processes (superposition, tunnelling, entanglement) provide the *mechanisms* by which the brain may interface with higher dimensions.

Examples:

* theta–gamma coupling as a “quantum gateway oscillator”
* endogenous DMT enabling brief perceptual decoherence
* holotropic states increasing quantum-level sensitivity
* psilocybin/LSD reducing top-down prediction and strengthening bottom-up field permeability

These effects allow consciousness to **slip into meta-dimensional bandwidths**.

# 🔷 3. Cellular–Biofield → Consciousness Modulation

The mitochondrial, fascia, vascular and electromagnetic layers form the *biological substrate* that tunes the field-connection.

Hyperdimensional access improves when:

* electrolytes are balanced (Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase stability)
* vagal tone is high
* breathwork induces CO₂–O₂ oscillatory shifts
* melatonin peaks (Witching Hour resonance)
* Schumann entrainment occurs near 7.83 Hz

This is why psychedelic microdosing, meditation, cold exposure, holotropic breathwork, and somatic practices modulate consciousness so strongly.

# 🔷 4. Consciousness Field → Atomic–Quantum–Cosmic Feedback

Once consciousness is recognised as a field, not merely a by-product, the entire system becomes **bidirectional**:

* insights (“downloads”)
* precognitive flashes
* synchronicity clusters
* archetypal entity encounters
* expanded pattern recognition
* creative epiphanies

These appear as *feedback effects* between the hyperdimensional layer and the lower physical layers.

This also frames the ""Star Mother"" or 5D neon-entity encounters not as hallucinations, but as **contact across dimensional strata**.

# 🔱 Why This Matters for N2N

The Unified Cosmic → Atomic Field System provides:

**• a scientifically compatible architecture** (quantum → macro)  
**• a phenomenologically accurate model** (psychedelics → mystical states)  
**• a spiritually coherent narrative** (Gaia, Akashic, entities, multidimensionality)

It doesn’t replace neuroscience or physics — it **integrates** them.

This is how higher-dimensional consciousness moves from an article in Popular Mechanics  
→ to a plausible scientific frontier  
→ to an experiential, testable model for awakened minds.

# ▫️ Footnote: Sources, Iteration History & Community Contribution

**Content provenance (approximate percentages):**

* **42% — Sources consulted:**
   * Recent peer-reviewed studies on higher-dimensional models of consciousness
   * Reviews on altered-state neurodynamics (signal diversity, oscillatory coupling)
   * Research on non-local cognition, quantum biological effects, and field-based theories of mind

Trinitarianism cannot be Sustained Without Tradition,"The doctrine of the Trinity has been at the center of Christian theology for centuries, yet a careful examination of Scripture exposes deep contradictions that Trinitarian theology struggles to resolve. 

From the Bible itself, it is clear that God is self-sufficient, independent, and supreme, while the Son, Jesus, repeatedly demonstrates dependence on the Father, calling the Father greater, acting only as the Father directs, and receiving authority and knowledge from Him. 

John 5:19 states plainly, “The Son can do nothing of Himself,” a verse that makes it clear that Jesus acts in complete dependence on the Father. 

He further says in John 5:30, “I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of Him who sent me.” 

In Acts 2:36, it is blatantly stated that God made Jesus the Lord and the Messiah.

These statements define the relationship between the Father and the Son in terms of authority and action, leaving no ambiguity.

The Old Testament (and also New Testament) consistently describes God as independent and self-sufficient. 

Acts 17:25 declares, “He Himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything,” emphasizing that God is the source.

Psalm 50:12 affirms, “If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is Mine, and everything in it,” 

Job 41:11 asks rhetorically, “Who has first given to Me, that I should repay him?” 

Isaiah 40:14 questions, “Whom did He consult, and who made Him understand?”

Malachi 3:6 reminds us that “I the Lord do not change.” 

Most importantly, Deuteronomy 6:4 declares, “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.” This verse affirms the absolute oneness and supremacy of God, leaving no room for a God with a superior or equals. 

God, according to Scripture, is the ultimate source, dependent on nothing and subordinate to no one. Yet Jesus, by His own testimony, can do nothing on His own, receives authority, knowledge, and life from the Father and acts in accordance with the Father’s will.

If Jesus were God in the same sense the Father is God, then Scripture presents a scenario in which God has a superior and is dependent on another. This would create a hierarchy of deities, producing a Lesser God and a Superior God and leading to a polytheistic pantheon, directly contradicting the clear biblical teaching that God is one. 

The plain reading of Scripture therefore shows that the Son is not God in the same absolute sense as the Father. His actions demonstrate limitation and dependence, which are incompatible with divine independence. The Father alone is described as supreme, the ultimate source of life, authority, and power. The Son’s obedience, dependence, and reception of authority point to his status as a created being, the highest of God’s creation, yet distinct from God Himself.

It is precisely because Scripture exposes these contradictions that Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions rely so heavily on ecclesiastical tradition. Councils, creeds, and long-standing interpretations provide the scaffolding that allows Trinitarian theology to survive despite the apparent inconsistencies in Scripture. 

Tradition interprets and defines terms such as “person” and “nature” in ways that the Bible never explicitly lays out. It dictates that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are co-equal, co-eternal, and fully divine, even though the text of the Gospels presents the Son acting in dependence on the Father. Without these centuries of interpretive tradition (which originated from Greek philosophy, already centuries old by the time of Nicaea in 325 A.D), Trinitarianism could not be sustained. The reliance on tradition is not incidental; it is the very mechanism that allows them to maintain Trinitarian claims that Scripture alone cannot justify.

In essence, the plain reading of Scripture presents a clear hierarchy: the Father is supreme, self-sufficient, and independent, while the Son depends on Him for authority, knowledge, and life. Trinitarian doctrine, however, insists on the full Godhood of the Son, a claim that Scripture does not support on its own. Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox adherence to tradition is therefore not just merely a matter of reverence or continuity, it is the essential tool that allows them to maintain Trinitarian claims that Scripture alone cannot justify. Tradition fills in the gaps, provides definitions for ambiguous terms, and imposes interpretations that reconcile the Son’s dependence with claims of divinity. Without tradition, Trinitarianism cannot stand; the contradictions become undeniable.

The result is a reliance on human-mediated interpretation and ecclesiastical authority rather than on the clear testimony of Scripture. The Bible, read without the lens of centuries of tradition, consistently affirms the supremacy, independence, and self-sufficiency of the Father and the subordination and dependence of the Son. Deuteronomy 6:4 makes the principle unmistakable: “The Lord is one.” 

It is this reality that reveals why tradition is not optional but central to sustaining Trinitarian theology and why, when stripped of tradition, the doctrine collapses under the weight of its internal contradictions. This is precisely why tradition is essential for them.",FrostyIFrost_,1pczhth,ArianChristians,03-12-2025,09:11:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArianChristians/comments/1pczhth/trinitarianism_cannot_be_sustained_without/

I Built an AI Sales Agent System - Looking for 5 Businesses,"Over the past 6 months, I've been building a multi agent AI system that handles lead qualification, outbound prospecting, and call setting for sales teams. I need 5 businesses to test it at scale across different industries.  
**The Problem**

Most businesses lose 40 - 60% of their leads because:

* Response time is too slow (leads go cold within 5 minutes)
* Manual followups are inconsistent
* You can't afford a full sales team
* Evenings and weekends = lost opportunities

Your competitors with bigger teams are eating your lunch while you're stuck doing admin work.

# What the System Does

1. Inbound Agent: Responds to inquiries in under 60 seconds, qualifies based on your criteria, books meetings on your calendar
2. Outbound Agent: Researches prospects, sends personalized sequences, follows up 5 - 7 times automatically
3. Calling Agent: Makes qualification calls, handles objections, transfers hot leads to you
4. Full Integration: Works with your existing CRM, calendar, email, and phone system

# Target Industries

Staffing & Recruitment Firms: Automate candidate outreach, pre-screening, and interview scheduling. Built for firms placing 10+ candidates/month.​

B2B Manufacturing: Handle RFQ responses, qualify buyers by budget/timeline, nurture 6 - 12 month sales cycles.​

Real Estate Agents/Teams: Instant response to property inquiries, buyer qualification, automated showing bookings.​

Mortgage Brokers & Lenders: Pre qualify leads, send rate scenarios, collect documents, book consultation calls 24/7.​

# The Beta Program ($500 for 7-Day Trial)

Step 1: Free 30min demo session where I show you:

* Live walkthrough of the AI agents in action.
* How it integrates with your current tech stack.

Step 2: If we're aligned, I build your custom MVP in 3 days for $500

Step 3: You test it with real leads for 7 days

Step 4: Love it? We move to production. Not satisfied? Full refund.

# Qualification Requirements (Please Read Before Applying)

I'm only taking 5 clients and need specific criteria

1. Revenue: $10K+/month.
2. Lead Volume: Minimum 20+ leads per month you're currently handling manually. 
3. 3.Existing Process: You have a sales process that works, we're automating it, not building from scratch.

Timeline: Ready to implement within 2 weeks of demo session​  
Industry Diversity: Taking max 2 clients per industry for testing purposes

# Who This Is NOT For

* Startups with no revenue or leads yet
* People who want to ""explore options"" for 3 months
* Businesses expecting zero setup effort
* Anyone thinking AI will magically fix a broken sales funnel​

# How to Apply

If you want in,  
DM ""BETA"" and I'll send the Demo Session Link.

I Built an AI Sales Agent System - Looking for 5 Businesses,"Over the past 6 months, I've been building a multi agent AI system that handles lead qualification, outbound prospecting, and call setting for sales teams. I need 5 businesses to test it at scale across different industries.  
**The Problem**

Most businesses lose 40 - 60% of their leads because:

* Response time is too slow (leads go cold within 5 minutes)
* Manual followups are inconsistent

Your competitors with bigger teams are eating your lunch while you're stuck doing admin work.

2. Outbound Agent: Researches prospects, sends personalized sequences, follows up 5 - 7 times automatically

Recomandare dermatolog,"Oare imi puteti recomanda vreun medic dermatolog din Oradea care se ocupa si cu tratarea alopeciei androgenice? Preferabil cineva care poate sa prescrie si medicamente de genul finasterida si minoxidil. Si bineinteles, sa fie dispus sa prescrie aceste medicamente. Spun asta deoarece am mai consultat alti dermatologi care mi-au recomandat doar vitamine si sampoane de tipul Alpecin.

Sunt constient de efectele secundare, dar as vrea totusi sa incerc tratamentul inainte sa ma impac de tot cu ideea. La momentul actual inca mai am destul par, care, cred eu, ar putea fi ""salvat"" cu acest tratament. Dar prima data vreau sa ma consult cu un medic pe tema asta.

Does the US–UK pharmaceutical deal serve us or the Corporations?,"[https://x.com/LizWebsterSBF/status/1995752766292058361?s=20](https://x.com/LizWebsterSBF/status/1995752766292058361?s=20)

**Le Monde: French press says the UK is now paying America’s pharma bill.**  
  
**France’s Le Monde reports the deal in devastating clarity.**  
**Britain will raise NHS drug prices by 25% in exchange for tariff relief.**  
**Their framing:**  
 **The US wins**  
 **The UK pays**  
 **The EU is next**  
  
**Le Monde bluntly describes the dynamic:**  
**“American patients have been forced to subsidise drugs in Europe.”**  
**Trump wants Europe to pay more.**  
**The UK just became the test case.**  
  
**France sees exactly what this means:**  
**Britain abandoned EU pricing norms in favour of US demands.**  
  
**This destroys the pathway to EU realignment.**  
  
**The tariffs weren’t hypothetical.**  
**Trump already applied them.**  
**The UK conceded after pressure.**  
**Le Monde frames this as a capitulation.**  
  
**Their final warning: The US will now pressure EU countries to follow the UK’s example.**  
  
**Britain has weakened Europe as well as itself.**  
  
**The French press has done what the British press refuses to do:**  
**Name this deal for what it is - a geopolitical submission.**

**The US–UK pharma deal is the most dangerous policy of the Starmer era.**  
  
**– Zero tariffs**  
**– Higher NHS drug prices**  
**– NICE thresholds lifted**  
**– More NHS money diverted to US pharma**  
  
**This is exactly what Brexit removed EU protections against.**  
  
**The NHS is being Americanised by stealth.**  
  
**Starmer tells the public what they want to hear on Brexit “closer alignment”, “fix the deal”, “honesty about the damage”.**  
  
**But behind the scenes he’s shoving a US trade model onto Britain that’s toxic for farming, toxic for standards, and now toxic for the NHS.**  
**Nice words for Europe.**  
  
**Poisonous deals with America.**

**Starmer abuses power to rewire NHS drug prices to avoid US sanctions with zero scrutiny.**  
  
**Starmer has signed a US deal that fundamentally rewires the NHS without Parliament, without Cabinet buy-in, without EU notification, and without any democratic mandate - purely to avoid Trump tariffs that haven’t even been imposed.**  
  
**Trump threatened 100% tariffs but never imposed them.**  
  
 **Starmer acted as if they already existed.**  
  
**This is exactly how strong-arm trade tactics work. America made a threat → Starmer folded → the UK rewired its entire health system.**  
  
**This confirms:**  
**•Britain is now subservient to US trade policy**  
**•Starmer’s govt is operating from panic, not strategy**  
**•NHS pricing decisions are now shaped by US leverage**  
  
**This MUST be challenged in court: Judicial review can be brought on:**  
  
**1. Procedural unfairness**  
**No consultation, no impact assessments, no Parliamentary process.**  
  
**2. Breach of legitimate expectation**  
**The UK promised “closer alignment”, then did the opposite.**  
  
**3. Breach of the Windsor Framework**  
**Pharmaceutical pricing absolutely affects NI supply chains.**  
  
**4. Breach of Article 10 TCA**  
**Trade distortion in a highly regulated sector.**  
  
**5. Irrationality / abuse of power**  
**Making major NHS decisions to dodge hypothetical tariffs**.

Additionally, delving into local market trends and establishing a budget for your acquisition is prudent.\
\

\
\
\

\

\
Pioneering an exploration of your financing alternatives early on in the process and ascertaining your affordability threshold is pivotal. Securing pre-approval for a loan can facilitate presenting a more competitive offer and streamline the acquisition process.\

\
\
\

\

\
Moreover, in tandem with zoning regulations, contemplating other local statutes such as building codes, environmental constraints, and easements is vital.

5. Execution of a Land Survey\
\
Before finalizing a land transaction, commissioning a licensed surveyor to survey the property is crucial. A land survey delineates the precise property boundaries and identifies potential encroachments or easements. This information is imperative for comprehending the land's actual size and form and can forestall potential disputes with neighbors or local authorities.\
\
Furthermore, contemplating a topographic survey in addition to a land survey is advisable. A topographic survey supplies detailed insights into the terrain, elevation, and natural features of the land, imperative for planning and development objectives.\
\
\
\
6. Evaluation of Utility and Service Accessibility\
\
Assessing the availability of essential utilities and services when contemplating land for sale is pivotal. This encompasses evaluating access to electricity, water, sewer, and telecommunication infrastructure. The cost and feasibility of connecting these utilities to the property can significantly impact its value and suitability for your intended purpose.\
\
In certain instances, procuring land in a remote locale may necessitate additional considerations such as off-grid living alternatives or alternate energy sources. Grasping the practicalities of accessing utilities and services contributes to a well-informed determination concerning a property's viability.\
\
\
\
7. Environmental Assessment\
\
Environmental considerations weigh heavily when acquiring vacant land, particularly if development is on the agenda. Assessing potential environmental hazards such as wetlands, floodplains, or contamination from prior land usages is paramount. An environmental assessment aids in identifying potential risks and liabilities associated with the property.\
\
Additionally, factoring in the land's natural attributes and resources such as soil quality, water resources, and wildlife habitat is indispensable. These factors influence the property's suitability for the intended purpose and its enduring value.\
\
\
\
8. Negotiation of the Purchase Agreement\
\
Upon identifying a fitting vacant land for sale, negotiating the purchase agreement assumes significance. Elements including the purchase price, earnest money deposit, closing date, and any sale contingencies or conditions feature in this negotiation. Carving out the purchase agreement is a pivotal juncture in the process and holds sway over the final sale terms.\
\
Seeking consultation with a legal professional or real estate agent to guarantee the fairness and legal enforceability of the purchase agreement is imperative. The agreement should delineate the rights and obligations of both parties and furnish a clear framework for consummating the transaction.\
\
\
\
9. Finalization of the Purchase and Ownership Transfer\
\
With the purchase agreement in place, progressing to finalize the sale and effectuate the land ownership transfer comes next. This may encompass finalizing financing, resolving outstanding contingencies, and procuring essential legal documents like a deed and title insurance.\
\
Customizing the final documentation and ensuring compliance with local laws and regulations may necessitate collaboration with a closing agent or attorney, contingent on the transaction's specific requisites.\
\
\
\
10. Development and Land Use Roadmap\
\
Post land acquisition, envisaging the development of the property in alignment with your plans and vision becomes tenable. This may involve securing requisite permits and approvals, enlisting contractors and architects, and overseeing the construction process.\
\
Prudent planning and contemplation of the long-term implications of the development plans, inclusive of cost, timeline, and regulatory requisites, is pivotal. Harnessing the expertise of professionals such as land planners and environmental consultants can underpin the feasibility and regulatory compliance of your development plans.\
\
In closing, the process of acquiring vacant land for sale encompasses several pivotal steps and considerations. Through comprehensive research, mastery of regulations and requisites, and collaboration with professionals, achieving an informed decision and navigating the acquisition process adeptly is possible. Whether seeking to erect a residence, commence a business, or invest in property, acquiring vacant land can transpire as a gratifying venture underpinned by meticulous planning and due diligence.\

Saw Prelude at dealer...Dead on arrival pt 2?,"I saw the new Prelude last night. See pics. Can confirm $60k otd, not incl interest. Salesman said they only get 3 allocations max per dealer and it's a limited production model, which could help residual values if leased. Lease payments ridiculously high. The civic type r next to it was only $4k more.

Impressions: I actually like that when the rear hatch is opened it looks like a Porsche, the driver seat is way more bolstered than the passenger's, and the paddle shifters are actually metal. It's a great car, but not $60k + interest great. I wonder if these will drop into the high $20s low $30s in three years. I didn't like that it lacked a sunroof. I tried to ignore that fact it really needed it at 60k.

Why Many Businesses Hesitate to Hire Remote Dedicated Resources — and Why They Actually Shouldn’t,"A lot of companies love the idea of remote work, but when it comes to hiring remote dedicated resources (FTEs), they become hesitant.
Here are some common reasons why businesses feel uncomfortable — and how these concerns can be solved with the right approach.


---

📌 1. “We’re not sure how productive a remote hire will be.”

Many companies fear that remote developers or consultants will be less accountable or harder to manage.

✔ How this is actually solved:

Clear communication structure (daily standups, end-of-day summaries)

Proper task tracking (Jira, ClickUp, Trello)

Worklogs, code reviews, and milestone-based progress
Most experienced remote professionals already follow these practices by default.



---

📌 2. “What if the skill level isn’t what was promised?”

Skill mismatch is a real pain point. Businesses worry the remote resource won’t match expectations.

✔ How this is actually solved:

Technical screening + sample deliverables

Reviewing past project work

Short paid trial periods

Direct interviews with your own team
This removes any ambiguity before onboarding.



---

📌 3. “Time zone differences will slow things down.”

Companies assume time zones create delays or communication gaps.

✔ How this is actually solved:

Remote developers often work overlapping hours

Async communication reduces dependency

Many experienced remote FTEs are already used to US/UK/AUS shifts
In reality, time zones rarely become an issue with senior remote talent.



---

📌 4. “Security and confidentiality concerns.”

Especially for industries like healthcare, finance, HR, etc.

✔ How this is actually solved:

NDAs, access-control, VPNs & encrypted communication

Limited environment access

Role-based permissions

Audit logs & activity monitoring
Remote teams today follow the same—or better—security discipline as in-house teams.



---

📌 5. “Local hires feel more reliable.”

A common perception: “If the person is near me, I can trust the output more.”

✔ But here’s the reality:

Remote senior developers tend to:

Have broader experience

Deliver faster

Work with higher accountability

Be exposed to diverse global environments
Reliability comes from skill + professionalism, not geography.



---

💡 Benefits of Hiring Remote Dedicated Resources

Once businesses overcome their initial hesitation, here’s what they actually experience:

✔ Access to stronger talent

Instead of being limited to one city or country, companies can hire global best-fit resources.

✔ 8+ years experienced developers at 40–70% lower cost

This is one of the biggest advantages.
Remote FTE = senior quality at a fraction of local hiring.

✔ Faster onboarding

Remote consultants can start in 24–72 hours, unlike local hires that take weeks.

✔ Higher flexibility

Scale up → Scale down → Project-based engagement → Part-time or full-time
Remote hiring adapts to your business needs.

✔ No infrastructure or overhead

No desk, no equipment, no local compliance, no insurance — just direct productivity.

✔ Value-added insights from experienced resources

Remote senior developers often bring best practices, architecture suggestions, optimization recommendations, and industry insights.

✔ Shorter delivery cycles

Remote FTEs working dedicated hours often deliver faster than traditional in-house teams.


---

🏁 Final Thought

Most businesses hesitate due to perception, not reality.
Once they hire their first remote dedicated resource, they often realise:

> “This is faster, more cost-effective, and more reliable than local hiring.”

What are the long-term effects of months of mild or moderate malnutrition on the brain for a 17 year old? read details please.,"I am a 17 female, 5 months, and my caloric needs are around 1300. I have started out at 44-45kg, I may have been 148cm tall or so, at around April, late or middle; I started restricting my food intake, eating less or much lesser than I need, most severely for a month or so until May, and I remember getting brain fog and some rare dizziness spells during that time. around June, I had become more moderate, yet still eating less than I need, and in July, where I found my weight to be 38Kg, which is equivalent to 17 BMI, I had started to eat regularly most of my caloric needs, 900 +, but not varied enough food, mostly peanut butter, and carbs such as bread and honey. at that point, I hadn't gotten my period at all, and my eating patterns got much better where I started to eat more nutritious and varied foods, up until October, when I had my period for the first time since April. my weight fluctuated across the months, and after improving my food intake, it was around 42, which is 18 -19 BMI. The past month, November, I had neglected my health and ate quite haphazardly and insufficiently, and I have lost some weight again, and my period didn't come since October. I have noticed, something which has emerged months ago, how bad my brain fog has gotten; I have not been able to focus or reach any goals which I have set for myself, I feel very slow-witted and I make a lot of mistakes, my performance on mentally-demanding tasks is worse and PLATEAUED. I am slower than a close sibling whom I have always thought to be my equal in intellect.

As I reflect, besides beating myself up over neglect, I have realized that I have not ever given myself enough time to fully recover, always hovering in that dangerous zone of eating lesser than my needs and being borderline underweight, with ups and downs and not enough protein or vitamin B, for 8 months. and I am incredibly afraid and have been obsessing over how I might have permanently damaged my brain, and curbed my intellectual potential.

I wish to know if this is at all true? has my brain been permanently damaged, or will I be able to fully or at least, mostly recover my quick wit and mental and cognitive abilities, if I quickly tried to get back to a healthy weight, such as 45 KG? I wish for a detailed answer, please. would consulting a dietician be necessary in my case for a thorough answer?

My only physical symptoms, which are few, have been some fatigue, decreased fluid retention, noticeable dark circles around the eyes, paleness, and the mental symptoms, including Executive dysfunction and forgetfulness, I have listed out.

sorry for the messy post. I do not have an eating disorder but I have done it for merely disciplinary reasons which have over time became a habit even though I have multiple times had the resolve to consciously mend my actions and gain weight (but the executive dysfunction and ADHD like symptoms made me negligent and forgetful.) I just wish for the full truth in order to deal with it and sort out my life. if there's permanent damage, I would like to know.",Rebornonmonday,1pcz72s,AskDocs,03-12-2025,08:51:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pcz72s/what_are_the_longterm_effects_of_months_of_mild/

At a complete loss for how to appropriately discipline my wildly out of control son,"
40Y Old dad here. I hate to be consulting online strangers about this, but I’m utterly lost and quite honestly at my breaking point with my son and everything he does. I feel as if I’ve exhausted every route I can conjure up and nothing is working, nor are professionals I’ve consulted, so this is my last ditch attempt of grasping at straws trying to find something that does help. 

My son is seventeen. I’m a single father, but he is biologically my child. His mother is not in the picture and hasn’t been since he was two. I feel the need to forefront this request for advice on behavioral correction by making it clear that I’ve sought professional help already regarding this situation. My son has seen numerous counselors, therapists, psychiatrists, and other general child/teen behavioral specialists. It’s been pretty damn solidly determined there’s no underlying mental illnesses, hormone imbalances, or environmental factors contributing to his behavior. As much as I hate to say it, I truly believe he’s just a badly behaved kid. 

He hasn’t always been a nightmare, growing up he was the sweetest kid until about a year ago when things slowly went downhill. He went from being well behaved at school and home, hanging out with good people, being active at school and socially, to now the complete opposite. He has zero respect for me or any other source of authority, zero comprehension of or care for repercussions, zero impulse control, and overall is horribly behaved. I quite literally can’t possibly even begin to list all of the things he’s done this past year or so, but to paint a picture some notable behavioral choices he’s made are him:

-Disappearing for nights/days at a time with no warning or explanation.
-Vaping and Drinking (Neither of which I even keep in the home).
-Stealing my car (He has/had his own, but I’ve had to start taking his keys and removing his license plate due to how he acts. In response he started to take mine, so now I have to hide my keys as well).
-Disappearing for two days only to pop up two states away from home. (No, I didn’t report him as a runaway because of how common his habit of just leaving and not telling me is. I also wasn’t aware he was in another state).
-Underage non-sub-discussable activities with people my age
-Acting out at school and showcasing a lack of respect for teachers (Numerous counts of Saturday school and detention. Ironically he still has good grades.. somehow).
-Refusing to go to school (He’s racked up countless absences and is indifferent to school-assigned disciplinary action).
-Cussing me out
-Regularly getting in fights

I’m ashamed to say that’s not even the tip of the ice berg, but I’d be typing all day if I listed everything. The point is that he’s wildly. out. of. control. I feel like I’ve exhausted every single discipline and behavioral correction method I can. I’ve tried taking away virtually everything, putting a lock on his window, installing cameras in the driveway, grounding him (Not that it ever works. I’ll leave for work and he’ll walk out the front door right past the cameras with zero fucks given), taking his keys/license plate/car, making him take corner store drug tests/do breathalyzers, having friends in law enforcement have talks with him; everything. I refuse to hit or physically harm him in any way as much as I admittedly loose my temper at times. I do yell at him, but that clearly has little effect. Words don’t work on him and it only ever ends in screaming matches between us. I refuse to send him to one of those wilderness camps- I’ve heard enough horror stories from them. Boarding school is on the table, but I’m honestly terrified of how he’ll act fully outside my supervision and I’d never forgive myself if something happened to him. 

Needless to say, I’m at a loss. Please, I’ll take any advice at this rate. Discipline ideas, potential boarding school advice, other psychiatric areas worth looking into (though I feel I’ve exhausted all of those),  ways I can support him through a more gentle parenting approach, anything.

"Why have many people claimed that the Chinese government did not honor its agreements regarding the universal suffrage, or believe that HK’s prosperity was due to the British rule of law and governance?","In insight, if you read the full context of the Article 45

>The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region **shall be selected by election** or **through consultations held locally** and **be appointed by the Central People's Government**.

>The method for selecting the Chief Executive **shall be specified in the light of the actual situation** in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and **in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress**. The ultimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures.

You’ll notice phrases such as **“shall be specified in light of the actual situation”** and **“in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress.”** This means that achieving universal suffrage **was always intended to happen step by step**. The Chinese government had also made it clear that **enacting Article 23 of the Basic Law** was one of the prerequisites for fulfilling this principle of gradual and orderly progress. However, HK was **supposed to pass its own Article 23 legislation**, but **didn**’t. Also, the HK protests, fueled by activists, and independence advocates, signaled to Beijing that many locals **might not be trusted to elect their leaders**. The experiment in **gradual democracy failed**, and **gradual and orderly progress** **toward universal suffrage** now **pretty much off the table**, though the Basic Law still allows decisions based on HK’s **actual situation**.

Many people screamed when the Chinese government implemented the National Security Laws, claiming it violated agreements. But, do they realize that the Chinese government has the authority **to amend and interpret the Basic Law**, as granted under **Article 158 and 159** of HK basic Law?

Some people claimed that the Chinese government reduced the number of representatives elected, allocating more seats to the Legislative Council instead. But do they realize that the HK Basic Law only say that HK should have elections, but d**oesn’t say how big the electoral college has to be, how many directly elected seats there should be, or who can’t run for public office?** These are details decided beyond the SBJD, for which China cannot be held liable *by treaty*.

Many people believe that HK’s success is mainly thanks to British rule of law and governance, but do they really understand what has made HK what it is today? **HK's advantages and success stem from China's isolation and backwardness**. As China continues to develop and become more open, HK will no longer have many special characteristics. Such historical changes will not be changed by the will of HK people. The gradual changes in HK's economic status are just a side effect of the huge changes in the world economic landscape.

HK thrived as a **false international entrepot or financial center**, as China’s **trusted gateway** to the world. By the early 21st century, most of its trade and listed companies were tied to mainland China, relying on essentially one “**big customer**.” Its wealth came from monopolizing China’s external trade, profiting through law firms, banks, consultancies, and trading companies. British rule or global financial status **played far less a role** than China’s size and trust in HK.

Its financial market largely serves China too--**90% of companies listed in 2022 were mainland Chinese**. Yet HK thrived, earning the nickname “Pearl of the Orient,” simply because **China is huge and trusted it**.

When you have a big customer with one billion people + 10 million square kilometers, and this big customer only sends orders to you, **It's hard for you not to succeed**.

Its real advantage was monopolizing China’s external trade, profiting from law firms, banks, consultancies, and trading companies, not being a global financial center or thanks to British governance.",MatchThen5727,1pcz3ts,AskAChinese,03-12-2025,08:46:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAChinese/comments/1pcz3ts/why_have_many_people_claimed_that_the_chinese/

Title: Need advice on EY GDS Contractor Role,"Hi everyone,
I recently received an offer for a Consultant (Contractor)  EY GDS for 6 months. It’s a good opportunity for me, but I’m genuinely confused right now.

I’m currently dealing with some ongoing health issues that require regular medication, and I’m not in a position to handle very heavy physical strain or extremely long sitting hours every single day. This is making me uncertain whether I should take this up.

During the interview, HR and the manager mentioned that this is a busy-period role.
I’ve also read some negative reviews about EY GDS work culture, stress, late hours, and burnout, which made me rethink my decision even more.

It would really help if anyone who has worked in EY GDS Assurance / Core Audit can share honestly:

How hectic is busy season for contractors?

Clio4 casse chaîne de distribution,"Hello les redditeurs, 
Premier post sur le r/voiture bien que très actif en consultation. (Longue vie à Toyota)

J’aurai besoin de vos avis pour un proche, sa Clio 4 2015 130 000 km essence 90cv (0.9 TCE) vient de lâcher sur l’autoroute pour semblerait-il, problème de chaîne de distribution.
Plusieurs interrogations :
combien cela coûte à réparer ? (J’ai cru comprendre qu’il faut changer le moteur complet car la casse de la chaîne aurait entraîner des dommages) 
cela vaut-il le coût ? La voiture semble coter a +/- 7k€ sur le marché de l’occasion en état de fonctionnement.
Le cas échéant, combien puis je en espérer pour pièce (leboncoin pour pièce/casse auto).

Pour info, elle est chez un garagiste qui dit que cela coûte trop cher à réparer (2000€-4000€) et propose un rachat à 300€, je me demande s’il n’essaie pas de se faire un billet mais je ne suis pas assez rodé pour en être convaincu…

Je n’ai pas l’impression que la question a déjà été posé d’où mon post, et vous remercie par avance.
Excellente journée.

She said that when she first saw my CV she thought I was “too marketing-focused,” but after speaking with me she felt reassured and understood why HR forwarded my profile.

Was asking that kind of question a mistake?

I need to decide but am too scared to go through with it because of my underlying fears,"I’m in the process of making the biggest decision of my life and I don’t know what to do next. I went to the facial team consult on Saturday in-person and they were very informative and lovely people. I could ask more questions but was too worried that I asked too much. The next day I went by myself to the group meeting (with other trans women and NB peoples) and I don’t know if something has shifted but the same surgeon did not say hi to me (sorry if I sound entitled). I just wanted to make sure that I’m making the right decision to go with someone who care about me while I’ll make this life changing decision on my face. But on Saturday they were very nice to me (I was with my grandfather at the time). 

I was told at the end of the meeting that it would be 20% of the surgical procedures if I go and do the surgery in January or latest in February. But I was worried because I would never cheap out on surgery so I thought something would go wrong. I talked to my grandad about it for awhile until we’ve come to a decision and after a week of waiting to see if he would accompany me for my surgery in Spain. He offered to help me financially but will have to pay him back later which is not an issue with me. 

On my mind, I had conflicting thoughts about the surgery like what anaesthesia would be like since I’ve never under the knife before. Worried about looking ugly as a woman than I did before as a man (I was called good looking and attractive by people). My goal is to look the same but just have my masculine features reduced so that I will be perceived as a woman. I don’t want to look like someone else. I like my face but I don’t like to look like a man. Hope that makes sense. I worry that there will be complications like I heard on Reddit and that I would suffer the same ordeal or I worry that I made the worst decision. I’m at a loss. I just wished that I was born female so none of this would be an issue. 

How long have I been wanting surgery (like saving up)? For 5 years with a lot of difficult times and struggle to become the woman I am. But I theorise that I I’ve wanted the surgery earlier because I use to cross dress really young and looking in the mirror and saw that young girl in me (good memories). Big <sigh>

I’ve been on hormones injections for about 4 years  and even longer than that since I’ve tried tablets, patches and sublingual routes in the past. Since I was 23 (now I’m 31). I’ve been discriminated, harassed, misgendered, laughed, and ridiculed for being and looking trans throughout those years (worked at hospital, as a scientist at a big pharmaceutical company but quit due to realising that they didn’t want me there because I was trans but couldn’t prove it). I now worked in retail pharmacy and enjoying it while I work on my animations when I get home for my Netflix show in the making. 

(Crying as typing this)…  I’ve told my grandad that  just sad because my mom doesn’t support my surgery and her fears that I could look botched like Kylie Jenner or Zac Efron) and that I will regret it if I get my surgery. As of now, my grandad is messaging my mom about having a meeting about my surgery since facial team only gave me 5 days to decide. I’m under pressure rn and I feel exhausted. 

Hope I can get advice on my situation. Would love to hear from anyone.",Kickapoointhahorse,1pcyoyx,MtF,03-12-2025,08:18:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1pcyoyx/i_need_to_decide_but_am_too_scared_to_go_through/
Women leaders an Islam,"Muslim women are leaders in their own right. There are biological, psychological, and physical differences between men and women, and both genders are not identical in their strengths and weaknesses. Men excel in one type of leadership, while women excel in another. Aisha (r.a.), the wife of the Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w), is a great example of a Muslim woman leader and scholar in Islam.

Today, Muslim women have served or are serving as leaders and prime ministers in Muslim-majority countries with the largest Muslim populations, such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. Muslim women have also been elected to many high-ranking positions in politics, administration, and other fields.

The majority of Muslims worldwide live in countries that have, at some point, elected women as leaders. The three most populous Muslim-majority countries—Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh—have all had women as leaders.

Many arguments have been put forward to claim that Islam treats women as secondary beings. Some quote a hadith in which the Prophet (s.a.w) said, ""A people will not succeed who are commanded by a woman."" (Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī) and argue that Islam is against women. However, this authentic hadith is often taken out of context to mean that women have no authority. When we compare Islam with other religions, it is clear that Islam grants women a great deal of freedom and authority. Let us examine what other religions, such as Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism, say about women and authority.

**Buddhism**: Buddha is quoted as saying:

* “Ananda, women are hateful, jealous, miserly, and lack wisdom; as a result, they neither come to the limelight, nor do they engage in industry or reap its benefits.” (Tripitaka-Anguttara Nikaya 4.80)
* ""Ananda, under whatever doctrine and discipline women are allowed to leave household life for the homeless state, that dhamma will not last long."" (Chulavagga 10.1)

**Christianity**: The Bible states:

* “I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must remain quiet.” (1 Timothy 2:12)
* “Let your women keep silent in the churches: for it is not permitted for them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.” (1 Corinthians 14:34)

**Hinduism**: In the *Manu Smriti*, which is accepted by many Hindus, it says:

* ""A female child, young woman, or old woman is not supposed to work independently, even at her place of residence.” (Manu Smriti 5/150)
* “Girls are supposed to be in the custody of their father when they are children, women must be under the custody of their husband when married, and under the custody of her son as a widow. In no circumstances is she allowed to assert herself independently.” (Manu Smriti 5/151)

Some Hindus argue that the *Manu Smriti* is just a *smriti* (text of tradition) and that the *Shruti* (the revealed scriptures) is what is important. Now, let us look at what the Vedas say about women:

* ""Indra himself hath said, 'The mind of woman brooks not discipline, her intellect hath little weight.'"" (Rig Veda 8:33:17)

As a researcher in comparative religion, I believe that Islam uplifts the status of women. The hadith mentioned should be understood in its correct context.

The Persians appointed the daughter of Chosroe as their queen, and then the Prophet (s.a.w) said, “No people who appoint a woman as their leader will ever prosper.” (Reported by al-Bukhārī, 13/53). When understanding this hadith, we must consider that the Prophet (s.a.w) said this in the context of a woman ruling over men, as leadership requires authority and a strong will to discipline and guide a nation. A woman in such a position could be physically threatened, challenged, or harassed. History has shown how female rulers were sometimes forced into marriage or even pressured to resign, as was the case with strong-willed leaders like Margaret Thatcher. This is why, in some contexts, men are considered more suited for leadership in a country.

 **Women Were Consulted**  
Women were even consulted in important matters, such as war, during the time of the Prophet (s.a.w). One example is as follows:

Marwan reported: After the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah was concluded, the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) said to his companions: ""Get up and offer your sacrifices, then shave your hair."" None of them stood up, and the Prophet repeated his order three times. When none of them responded, the Prophet went to Umm Salamah and told her about their reluctance. Umm Salamah advised him: ""O Prophet of Allah, would you like your order to be carried out? Go out and do not speak to them until you have offered your own sacrifice and called the barber to shave your head."" (Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī)

The Prophet (s.a.w) took the advice of his wife, which shows how Islam values women's opinions and contributions.",Constant-Plenty8905,1pcyonp,CJAhmed,03-12-2025,08:17:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/CJAhmed/comments/1pcyonp/women_leaders_an_islam/
"General surgery,KEM Hospital Pune","Kem hospital pune (a corporate hospital, don't confuse it with Kem mumbai) has recently restarted the dnb gen surgery programme. If any candidate is interested, this is for their information.

The department right now is filled with ayurveda MOs. Some of them are bams, some are BAMS+MS. This lot has a huge inferiority complex which leads them into constant conflicts with actual dnb residents of other dept. The surgery consultants promote this behaviour as they know these MOs are going to perpetually stay in their department and be their personal assistants. 

This is definitely going to cause issues for the new DNB residents. In fact, one of the older surgery consultants was talking about how DNB residents will be a headache and that they eventually will demand respect from these MOs. Another one has told his MOs that they are equal to residents. Ofcourse, they pay them less than one third of a residents stipend, but we don't talk about that. 

New candidates that are planning to take up DNB in any corporate hospital must keep this in mind. Visit the hospital and talk to people. You may talk to the dept MOs ofcourse, but try to get a proper picture. One of the MOs was talking to a candidate about how there will be less handson for him in the first year, as if she's a senior resident who knows how DNB works. Be careful about your choices.

Wirtschaftsinformatik – Consulting einsteigen oder lieber Industrie/Versicherung? Erfahrungen gesucht.,"Hey zusammen,
ich habe gerade mein Wirtschaftsinformatik-Studium abgeschlossen und stehe vor der Entscheidung, ob ich ins Consulting gehen soll oder lieber direkt in die Industrie bzw. Versicherung/Banken wechsel.

Consulting reizt mich einerseits (viel lernen, verschiedene Kunden, breites Skillset), andererseits höre ich oft Negatives: lange Fahrzeiten, Reisetätigkeit, Druck, wenig Work-Life-Balance, hoher Wechsel.
Industrie/Versicherung soll dafür stabiler sein, aber teilweise “langweilig” und weniger abwechslungsreich.

Da ich zwischen den Richtungen schwanke, würde mich eure Erfahrung interessieren:
	•	Wie wart ihr mit einem WiInf-Hintergrund zufrieden im Consulting?
	•	Bereut ihr es oder würdet ihr wieder rein?
	•	Ist der Einstieg in die Industrie smarter langfristig (Karriere, Gehalt, Stress)?
	•	Wie sind eure Erfahrungen speziell in Versicherungen oder Banken?
	•	Wo hat man bessere Exit-Opportunities, also kann man von Consulting einfacher in die Industrie wechseln? 
	•	Worauf würdet ihr heute achten, wenn ihr neu starten könntet?
	•	Wie schätzt ihr die Zukunft von Bereichen wie SAP, ServiceNow? 

Bin dankbar für jede Perspektive – würde gerne vermeiden, in einer Sackgasse oder einem für mich falschen Umfeld zu landen.

Danke euch 🙏

Intramediculary humerus nail removal denied at the day of operation and I'm absolutely gutted. Any advise?,"For info: I'm male, 27 years old. I broke my humerus in October 2023 during arm wrestling. It was a very stupid thing to do, and I was kind of talked into it, but I didn't think much about the possible outcome, let alone that my humerus could break while doing that. Well, I learned my lesson.

The operation was kind of okay. They inserted the intramedullary nail, and I woke up after everything was done. Unfortunately, they discovered that my hand and fingers didn't move due to a possible radial nerve palsy. I read that this is a possible occurrence after breaking the humerus. So the next day I had to undergo a second operation where they cut the backside of my arm in order to see if the nerve was intact. It was okay. They said they had just irritated the nerve a bit.

The recovery was absolutely painful. For roughly half a year I couldn't extend my arm because of tendon shortening, and it took a bit longer until my fingers and hand recovered from the nerve injury. Until then it just kept getting better.

A year after the occurrence I talked to my local surgeon and she said that the nail could be removed. However, that wasn't easy to arrange.

I broke my humerus in a city 300 km away from where I live, and due to complications during the operation, mainly the miscommunication about discharging me and the lack of care at the hospital, I didn't want to have the nail removal done at that particular hospital.

So I talked with three hospitals about a possible removal, and after a while one of them said that it would be possible and that they would like to schedule an appointment with me.

At the hospital we discussed my issues and my motivation regarding the nail removal. I was advised that it isn't really necessary to remove the nail unless I have problems with it, because an additional operation means trauma and a possible second nerve palsy.

I was okay with the risks and agreed to move things forward. I was told that I needed a CT in order to get an appointment for the operation and also the model numbers of the implants used in my surgery because they weren't described anywhere in my papers, not even in my operation report.

I had a lot of phone calls and emails with the hospital where I had my bone fixed, asking them to send me the exact implants they had used so that I could get them removed. In the end, a registered letter with a return receipt did the job. But it took literally three months or so. It was an absolute shitshow.

In the meantime I had an appointment for the CT and the findings said: possible pseudoarthrosis. I read it and was absolutely gutted as my surgeon had said that the X-rays looked fine. So I took the findings to the hospital that had agreed to the nail removal, but they needed the CT images, not just the written findings. So I had to make an additional appointment at the radiology practice to get the images. Apparently they couldn't send them via email or give me a CD. This process delayed everything by about a month.

After I got my images I went back to the hospital and they looked through them. They couldn't understand the diagnosis. Everything looked healthy and good, so they agreed to move forward with the operation and give me a date for it.

The operation was planned for yesterday (02.12) and I had the preliminary consultation with a surgeon and an anesthesiologist the day before. I had to go through dozens of papers about possible risks of the nail removal and the surgeon emphasized that a nerve palsy might be possible as well. However, they all seemed somewhat skeptical about my plan, which I understand after reading a lot about the risks.

The day of the operation. I needed to arrive at 10 am and my operation was planned for 7 pm. At 11 am I got a call from a surgeon asking if I was already at the hospital. I said I was. He asked for my location, picked me up and said that we needed to talk.

He said that the doctors had agreed the evening before to cancel my operation. Unfortunately he was not involved in the decision making process, but he asked me about the complications I had after my first operation. I told him about the nerve palsy and he said that this was likely the reason for cancelling the operation due to the risk of irreversible nerve damage. Mind you, this was the first time someone had spoken about irreversible nerve damage to me. Before that it was never communicated that clearly.

He said that I could still try to find someone else to remove it, but my best bet would be the hospital that did my initial operation because otherwise it would be hard to find a hospital willing to accept the risk. So I was sent home and I still feel helpless and really bad to be honest.

So now let me tell you why I wanted to have it removed.

My arm just feels overly stiff and unnatural. Day to day everything seems fine, however once sports or a lot of movement is involved I feel a lot of unpleasant tension in my humerus and pain in the shoulder area. In all honesty it isn't that bad of a pain, but it is noticeable and something I didn't plan on living with for the rest of my life. At night, when sleeping with my arm above my head, my shoulder lets me know that it is there, every single night. And after a day of physical work, for example lifting a lot of things, working on my car and similar tasks, I get a burning sensation all around my humerus after everything comes to rest. Maybe that isn't enough to justify the risks of a removal, which I completely understand. But is there something I can do about it? I feel like this isn't given any attention by the doctors because I am probably young. They just said that this is normal because the metal inside my bone isn't as flexible as my bone structure. They also encouraged me to do some sports, which in all honesty I haven't done at all because it's painful. Whether it's swimming or push ups. I just don't want to push through the pain. Or is it still the lack of muscle? I'm clueless.

The worst thing of all is that I postponed my three month internship following a practical exam for a new job for this operation. I am currently in a workplace where I am really stuck and not happy at all. And all of this is giving me a really bad time.

Slept with ex now I feel like the biggest idiot,"My ex (42m) and I (31f) broke up about 8 weeks a girl and we ended up crossing paths at an AA convention (we are both in the program) and one thing led to another, he invited me to his room, and I slept with him. It didn’t feel like casual sex. It did feel very intimate and we did talk afterwards, stayed up all night cuddling and then talking. I didn’t leave feeling bad. I actually felt really good and I felt like things were OK finally and he told me he would talk to me later.  He ended up texting me about 2 PM telling me he just got home and needed a long nap and then I didn’t hear from him the rest the night and he read my text at 5:30 PM. That’s when the anxiety set in. Now that we aren’t together, he is allowed to do things like that and I know he knows that it didn’t make me feel good and he still chose to do it.

The next day he called me and told me that he did want me in his life but he doesn’t know how because he can’t go back to how it was and the accusations of cheating. Then he continued to say in a perfect world we could’ve worked out. And then basically repeated the same thing about how he does want me in his life. I told him we could take it slow and I would prove to him I can be better  and figure it out as we go he said OK sounds good.

Of course it all hit me a couple hours later when I started to realize after talking to one of my friends, there were reasons why I thought he was cheating. The inconsistent schedule even though we make our own schedule something didn’t add up. I kept having these feelings about a certain girl that  just didn’t make sense to me. He got really quiet and distant, and really angry and hostile towards me especially when I would try to have a calm non-blaming conversation, and if there was something else going on in his life. I literally found out that he started drinking, which would make sense why some of the anger happened. But also deepen my fear of him cheating because I know that he has cheated while drinking in the past with other relationships and I just could not shake this feeling about this girl.  

Fast-forward he actually did end up moving out of the condo that we moved in together literally two months prior with both my daughter and his son and he moved back in with his mother. I really didn’t think it was gonna last that long because we’ve been down this road, but at a different time when we didn’t share responsibilities. But as the weeks passed, started to realize that he hasn’t came back And it started to settle in.

Every time I would try to talk to him and tell him to come home, he would remind me that he left me and that it’s over and he’s moved on, and I should move onto. I couldn’t even believe the words that were coming out of his mouth because he’s never talk to me like that even in our previous break ups, he’s never said anything like this And he has been treating me like I cheated or did something extremely bad to him when I have been a very loving, thoughtful, understanding a woman to him. I cook, I clean, I work hard, I’m a great mother, I’m devoted to my relationship, love of God, I’m pretty, I’m fit, and I tried so much harder to be everything else for him yet I’m being treated like the villain.  Towards the end, probably the last two weeks before he moved out, we literally fought every single day. But most of it was me trying to ask him what’s going on why are you being like this? What is wrong? What is making you treat me this way I take responsibility for maybe pushing but I was concerned and I was scared.

Not only did this affect me emotionally in every single way, it affected my income. As my ex was also my manager and my partner in work so now I have been left with things that I’ve never dealt with before in the winter season when work actually slows down(I’m a claims consultant for a restoration company)  and we were gonna figure it out together. He is still paying his half the rent, but the emotional weight of all the things that break up has touched has left me in a very bad spot, emotionally and financially.


And then I fucking slept with him. I felt like that was my only power and I gave it away. He is still communicating with me occasionally like today he sent me a picture of him and told me he’s been working out super hard like he’s in training mode and he’s getting ripped. Mind you we’ve been broken up for eight weeks so he trying to tell me he’s doing so much better since he left me so that was cool

I just want to change this dynamic. I want to flip this in someway if anyone has any advice for me and if you were able to make it through the whole post, lol

Stuck in community pharmacy and studying bioinformatics: what jobs should I aim for?,"
Hi everyone,

Sorry in advance if this is a bit long: I’m trying to make sense of what I want, but I’m feeling pretty lost.

I’m a 30M trained pharmacist with 7+ years of experience in community pharmacy. I’ve done everything: technician, trainee, pharmacist, even pharmacy manager. After the pandemic and the constant pressure of the job, I’ve come to hate the work environment. I’m exhausted by the long hours, dealing with customers nonstop, and the toxic “small business” expectations of being available 24/7. The only real upside is the salary, which is above average but still not amazing.

I’m currently legally bound to my workplace for an indeterminate amount of time (hopefully less that a year), so while I wait this out, I decided to start an online Master’s degree in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics. I find the field genuinely interesting and I think it could lead to the intellectually stimulating work I’ve always wanted. But because I’m working 50+ hours a week, I’m progressing slowly and often rushing projects just to meet deadlines. It makes me feel like a fraud because I don’t feel like I’m actually learning enough or enjoying what I'm doing.

When I browse LinkedIn, I mostly see postdoc roles or mid/senior positions. I don’t want to do a PhD. Meanwhile, a friend of mine (not healthcare-related at all) works for a marketing consulting company building data infrastructure for clients, and her job sounds great: normal hours, remote work until recently, a solid salary and the work itself seems interesting. That lifestyle and type of work really appeal to me.

I’m based in Europe and I guess my question is:

- What realistic entry-level career paths could someone like me break into, either in healthcare/biotech or outside of pharma altogether?

I’ve always assumed my life would be: community pharmacy or hospital or pharma industry. But now I’m wondering if there are roles in data, tech, consulting, analytics, or something similar that would suit my background, especially since I’m studying bioinformatics/biostats.

Any advice from people who have made a similar transition, or who work in data/tech roles, would be hugely appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Desperate looking for advise as a new grad project coordinator with no construction experience.,"I'm so stressed and need some advise/consultation on how to get more leads based on our situation.

Here is the puzzle:

We are a construction family, I recently graduated with a completely different degree and had no construction experience. We own a renovation company, and only recently started building our online presence when I took over the marketing duties this past month. My brother runs the company, and he wants to learn from our senior professionals (He's the main person doing to job and have no time to respond to calls, AND poor in English).

Our leader has over 30+ years of international commercial experience and has managed/directed various structural engineering projects worth over $100M. Experience wise, he knows everything. However, all of those were government projects, which means he doesn’t have a portfolio he can publicly show because the rules were different back home. He also doesn’t speak English and only speaks Mandarin. He is supposed to be retired but came back for my brother business.

I once tried estimating and submitting bids, but whenever contractors called me, I had no idea what they were talking about. I tried redirecting the conversation into email so I could understand and translate it properly, but they never followed through once the call ended.

Now the leader's back to work, but can only take on residential and small renovation projects. Because he doesn’t have any network here we tried our best to win leads in the Mandarin circle and now that we’re running out of small renovation jobs too for saturated reason. He also tried partnering with Mandarin-speaking people in the field, but most of our “partner” basically used us for consultation and then pushed him out to take future leads for themselves. I really don’t understand why people who brag a lot get more leads than we do, even though we actually do the work more and better.

Me, as the bridge know nothing about construction and sitting here chatting with grok and GPT is having so much stress. I know at some point in heart the conversation is getting more and more hallucinated, so I came here looking for real advise.

Please… I genuinely don’t know what to do to help right now beside running ads for renovation and structural leads (which is even worse because people just came to ask for estimate), and running social media, editing and all that to create a dynamic portfolio to earn trusts. But those will take a long time to build and doesn't help much for now in getting leads. I haven't try spamming people with email and wonder if that is a feasible step without hurting reputation. This is a family business. I’m pretty tech-savvy, so I can handle the online and digital side. We are Toronto-based, and I appreciate any advice. I just want to help set up a proper pipeline so the business can run smoothly without needing me for everything that requires English..",Fluid-Mechanic-5968,1pcyg9z,ConstructionManagers,03-12-2025,08:03:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConstructionManagers/comments/1pcyg9z/desperate_looking_for_advise_as_a_new_grad/

Would this type of private network actually appeal to you?

SSD: Samsung 990 Pro - 1x 2TB & 1x 4TB 

  
Now, I've consulted the internet, ChatGPT and fellow streamers and still don't see any different results. 

What I've tried:

\- Limiting the FPS of the game

\- Limiting the FPS of the game in OBS

\- Switching around encoder settings

\- Starting OBS as admin

\- Switching the encoder from GPU to CPU(onboard GPU) encoder

How GLP-1 consultations work in Japan (simple explanation),"I work at a pharmacy in Tokyo, and a lot of visitors (and even locals) are really confused about how GLP-1 prescriptions work here.  
So here’s a simple, non-medical explanation of what the typical process looks like from the pharmacy side:

1. You always need a doctor’s consultation

Japan doesn’t allow dispensing weight management meds (Mounjaro, Ozempic, etc.) without a doctor reviewing your case first.  
Most consultations are pretty short, often 3minutes, but they must be done. And it's mostly about the confirmation of name, medication history and the dose you want to/can get.

2. The prescription is sent electronically

In most clinics, the prescription comes through an electronic system directly to the pharmacy.  
From the pharmacy side, we only dispense what the clinic has prescribed.

3. Pickup or delivery depends on the clinic

Most clinics allow pick-up in person as well as delivery service.  
This part varies a lot not standardized, for example, some clinics do both domestic and international delivery, but some only do domestically.

That’s the general outline.  
If anyone has questions about how the system works (not medical advice), I’m happy to clarify.  
Japan’s process is pretty straightforward but very regulated.",AnglePrimary7051,1pcyetk,Tokyo,03-12-2025,08:00:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tokyo/comments/1pcyetk/how_glp1_consultations_work_in_japan_simple/

Freelance or different job,"Current situation, I’m working at a company as IT Support (medior role with options to move over to senior middle of next year) on the payroll.

The issue is that it’s a consultancy gig where I work with two intermediary companies. 
So by the time they all take their cut - there’s not much left for me.

I know that I make very little - but I’m actively looking to change that. So no need to repeat what I already know..

Currently I make:
Gross: 2500
Net allowance: 125€/month
Phone plan + home internet.
Company car, middle class (value of 35k) + fuel card.
The usual group insurance and medical insurance and end of year bonus.

With all taxes etc it nets a little over 2050€ net

I have been in discussion with my employer for a while but they are not budging on increasing my salary.

Where I’m working now (the client) they would be willing to take me on as freelance via another intermediary. However, I’m not sure about the numbers. I think I could get away with 500€/day.

Would that be ‘workable’? Or should I just go look for another job all together but on payroll.

I do like the current job, but not for the current pay.

Should I get an employment advocate?,"TLDR; coworker has made some pretty serious (but mostly false) allegations against me, the company seems to be following a correct and fair process - should I get an employment advocate or lawyer involved?

So a co-worker who I thought was a friend, has raised a complaint against me to HR which has led to some serious allegations made against me.

Last week, I was called into a meeting with my senior manager and HR which they notified me of the allegations which falls under serious misconduct and may lead up to summary dismissal. My senior manager let me know at that stage, there was only preliminary information and an investigation process would be initiated. I would be made aware of any information regarding the allegations in full, along with any evidence. I would also be advised in detail of any investigation processes they follow. I was also advised I would be given a full opportunity to respond to the allegations. For safety concerns, it was proposed for me to take fully paid special leave (which is not deducted from any of my leave balances) while the company begins the investigation. I was also advised this was to ensure a fair investigation for everyone and for me to seek advice on the matter.

A day later, I received a letter confirming my special leave and minutes from the initial meeting.

A couple days later, I received a Notice of Investigation letter which had some high level details of the complaint and the proposed investigation process. They have said I am welcome to bring a support person to any scheduled meetings and if I wish, seek independent legal advice. They also detail an Employee Assistance Program for my wellbeing during this time.

After that, I received another letter detailing the draft terms of reference of the investigation approach and full details of the complaint made by my coworker. I have been given a couple of days to review the terms of reference for feedback or comments.

Looking at the allegations made, I can confidently say most of the allegations are not true. There are some allegations which I feel has been taken out of context or missing some important information which I believe my co-worker purposely left out to make it seem worse than they actually were. For example, what I believed was a light hearted joke at the time but clearly I misread the situation.

I plan to prepare my responses to which I will be obviously denying the allegations which aren’t true and providing more background information about the allegations which my coworker definitely missed important information about. I will mention that given the nature of our relationship and how they responded to the jokes / what I said at the time, didn’t lead me to believe they weren’t okay with it. Any time I did think I made a potentially edgy joke, I would immediately say “if that kind of joke isn’t okay with you, let me know and I won’t make it again”, to which they responded “it’s okay”. I know that’s not a good excuse but I have only ever cared for/supported this person so these allegations have completely blindsided me.

A bit of background on my working relationship with this coworker - I thought we had a pretty good friendship, we sat next to each other and would always be either laughing or giggling at something, we would sometimes hang out during our lunch or morning tea breaks and I even went to an expo one weekend with them (after asking if they would like to do that, seeing as I thought they would enjoy what the expo was about). Now one of their claims was that I would often ask to hang out on the weekend alone when in fact, that expo was the only time and I assured them that if they didn’t want to go with me, they didn’t have to. A lot of the claims they made seem to be all things said when were hanging out during our breaks or at our desks. All of our personal text messages and Teams messages don’t show any bad messages which support their allegations but rather show that everything seemed okay?

At this stage, I am wanting to know if it is worth getting an employment advocate involved? I have had an initial free consultation with employmentlaw.net.nz but not sure if I should fully get them fully involved since the fees are still pretty expensive.

I got revision DJS/ jaw surgery in korea mainly for aesthetic reasons,"I’m currently 13/14 days post-op and I can genuinely say I’m extremely happy with my results! I feel like a little cutie patootie >< 

left is pre surgery 

middle is post op (im literally crying in the image because looking at my face always made me cry after my first operation 😭) 

right is revision surgery 13/14 day post op aka rn! and i am obsessed with the results :D 

it’s such a striking difference in the way i feel about my first surgery vs revision. 

I know it’s very taboo on this subreddit to pursue jaw surgery for aesthetic reasons or to choose a plastic surgeon over a traditional hospital team. I’ve had a lot of comments in the past telling me not to do it.

For me, the risk was worth it. I’m still very swollen, I won’t share proper comparison photos yet (the professional ones + CT scans)  will add more info n movements in following posts, all questions will be answered eventually so please be patient <3 

 I’ve been compiling charts, writing a report about my experience, and putting together documents that I hope will help others in the future. 

i want to make a whole video, and share my images because anyone who’s in my shoes i want to show the whole process of my journey. 

Recently someone DM’d me asking how to explain this surgery to friends, family, or partners who only see it as medically necessity and not cosmetic. I had the same struggle. 
EVERYONE  except my mum and my orthodontist was against my revision because they thought I was “already pretty” and didn’t understand what I was going through. Yes, aesthetics were part of my concern, but my issues were also affecting my health. I actually made a PDF breaking down why my revision was medically necessary and not purely plastic surgery. 

I hope this helps anyone who is in a similar situation whether you’re doing medical tourism, going primarily for cosmetic reasons, or trying to understand the overlap between aesthetics and function. At the end of the day, you can’t even qualify for this surgery unless something is functionally wrong, and your quality of life really is impacted !!! 

Cheers :) stay strong !  It’s not the end of the world. I hope everyone on this subreddit finds peace as I want to return my knowledge to the people here as they helped me immensely a year ago when i was struggling with my first operation. 

P.S If anyone wants to know my surgeon, feel free to DM me.
I’m only willing to share privately if you’re seriously considering booking with them, since I spent a lot of time and money on consultations and research before choosing my clinic.
I went with a plastic surgery clinic, so I don’t want to openly promote it here because I respect that this subreddit prefers hospital-based maxillofacial teams and I understand and agree with that preference.
That’s why I won’t post my surgeon or clinic publicly. But I’m happy to share privately if you genuinely want the information & are serious !!! And already done your due diligence in research. ",Over-Alternative-139,1pcybio,jawsurgery,03-12-2025,07:54:48,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pcybio

**Why Painting Is More Than Just a Task**

Painting a home may seem simple, but true artistry lies in the details. It’s in the even brushstrokes, the seamless edges, and the way color enhances natural light. A professional [**Residential Painting Service in Nassau**](https://allpropaintingco.com/interior-painting/) does more than just cover walls—they bring vision to life.

"The Dashboard Light Decoder: What That ""Check Engine"" Symbol Really Means","**Category:** [Car Maintenance](https://mechanic4me.com/) / DIY Guide **Reading Time:** 4 Minutes

It’s a scenario every driver dreads. You are cruising down the highway or stuck in bumper-to-bumper city traffic, enjoying your music, when suddenly a *beep,* a mysterious orange symbol pops up on your dashboard.

https://preview.redd.it/11mwjd4p1y4g1.png?width=2816&format=png&auto=webp&s=bedac171c43bb378c4c25813b8e66c911af18b30

Your heart skips a beat. Is the engine about to explode? Do you need to pull over immediately? Or is it just a sensor glitch?

Modern cars communicate with us through these lights, but unfortunately, they often feel like hieroglyphics. Today, we are decoding the dashboard so you can stop panicking and start acting.

# First: The ""Traffic Light"" Rule

Before we look at specific symbols, you need to know the universal color code used by car manufacturers (Maruti, Hyundai, Tata, and luxury brands alike):

* 🔴 **Red Light:** **DANGER.** This is serious. You usually need to stop the car immediately and safely to avoid permanent damage.
* 🟠 **Yellow/Orange Light:** **CAUTION.** Something is wrong, but you can usually drive the car to the nearest garage. Do not ignore it for long.
* 🟢 **Green/Blue Light:** **INFORMATION.** This just means a system is on (Headlights, Indicators, Cruise Control). You are good to go.

# The Big 4: Symbols You Cannot Ignore

# 1. The [Check Engine](https://mechanic4me.com/) Light (The Submarine)

**What it looks like:** An outline of an engine (often looks like a submarine or a tap). **Color:** Usually Orange/Yellow.

This is the most confusing light because it can mean anything from a loose fuel filler cap to a major engine misfire.

* **What it means:** The car's computer has detected an issue with the engine’s operation or emissions system.
* **Common Indian Causes:** In India, this often triggers due to **adulterated fuel** or a dirty oxygen sensor.
* **What to do:** If the car drives normally (no shaking or weird noises), you can drive it to the service center. If the light is **flashing/blinking**, pull over—it means severe engine trouble.

# 2. The Oil Pressure Light (Aladdin’s Lamp)

**What it looks like:** An old-fashioned oil can with a drop coming out. **Color:** Red.

**⚠️ DANGER:** This is arguably the most critical light on your dashboard.

* **What it means:** Your engine has lost oil pressure. Without oil pressure, metal parts grind against each other.
* **What to do:** **Stop the car immediately.** Do not try to reach the next petrol pump. Turn off the engine. Checking the oil dipstick might show you have oil, but the *pump* might have failed. Call a tow truck. Driving even 1 km can seize your engine and cost lakhs in repairs.

# 3. The Battery Alert (The Lego Brick)

**What it looks like:** A rectangle with a plus (+) and minus (-) sign. **Color:** Red.

* **What it means:** Many people think this means the battery is dead. It actually means the **Alternator** (the part that charges the battery while driving) is not working. The car is currently running only on battery power, which will drain very quickly.
* **What to do:** Turn off the AC, radio, and unplug phone chargers immediately to save power. Drive straight to the nearest mechanic before the car dies completely.

# 4. The Temperature Gauge (The Thermometer)

**What it looks like:** A thermometer dipping into waves. **Color:** Red.

* **What it means:** The engine is overheating. This is very common during Indian summers or in heavy traffic jams.
* **What to do:** Pull over safely. Turn off the engine and let it cool for at least 30 minutes.
* **Crucial Warning:** **NEVER** open the radiator cap while the engine is hot. The pressurized steam can cause severe burns.

# The ""False Alarm"": Service Due Light

**What it looks like:** A spanner or wrench tool. **Color:** Orange.

Don't confuse this with the ""Check Engine"" light. This simply means your car has crossed its kilometer limit (e.g., 10,000 km) and is due for a scheduled service. It is a reminder, not a malfunction.

# Summary: Your 3-Step Action Plan

If a light pops up during your drive, follow this protocol:

1. **Don't Panic:** Check the color. Is it Red or Orange?
2. **Listen and Feel:** Turn down the music. is the car making a grinding noise? Is it shaking? Is there smoke?
3. **Consult the Glovebox:** Your user manual has a full list of these symbols. If it’s a Red light (Oil or Temp), pull over and call Roadside Assistance.

Father suffering from Prostate Cancer,"Hey everyone, a month ago, my father (62Y)was sick every now and then. One night, he had acute lower abdominal pain and we took the emergency consultation. A couple of week went by. We took multiple tests, CT scans, blood reports and everything. We found out the my father suffers from Stage IV Prostate Cancer (PSA 49.5) which has metastasised(spreaded) to bones in many parts of the body. This was concluded via a PET scan. Now we have two options, one is surgery and other is the quarterly injection to stop cancer from spreading which we are on to and will go ahead with the quarterly injections as of now because surgery may prove somewhat effective but cancer might come back in 3-4 years(very high chances).

So, coming to the question now. What are other medications that might prove effective and won't hamper allopathic treatment? I'm asking if anyone can help me to find out a good Ayurvedic or Homeopathic doctor whose medication will slowly help the ongoing allopathic medication and can be proven effective.

Please advice.

Advice Requested regarding Immigrating to Europe/Australia/New Zealand from Southeast Asia,"Hello there. I hope I am posting this in the right place.

I am looking for some advice from experienced people about immigrating to Europe, Australia or New Zealand from a Southeast Asian country. I recently finished my BBA. Currently, I am continuing my studies, pursuing Chartered Accountancy certification while also holding a lower-middle level corporate job in accounts at a pharmaceutical company. I have quite a bit of experience in the fields of accounting, auditing, and related consulting (around seven years in total, almost four years employed as a full-time salaried employee).

My questions are these:

1. If I want to avoid further studies and directly enter the workforce, what are the chances of getting a job in one of these countries that will help me to also move countries?

2. Should I complete my CA qualification before attempting to move? Will that somehow help my chances?

I apologize if these are silly questions. I feel like I am stuck in a fork in the road, and I would really use some outside perspective on what to do going forward.",OkContribution9156,1pcy08g,immigration,03-12-2025,07:35:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/1pcy08g/advice_requested_regarding_immigrating_to/

Helping people with their VSLs, offers, CRO, landing pages, and overall strategy has honestly been one of the most enjoyable parts of what I do. I’ve got a little free time this week, so I’m opening a few **completely free** 30-minute help sessions.

**No catch. No pitch. Just real help.**

**Quick note:**  
 Last time I took on *way* too many people, and it made it hard to give everyone the attention they deserved ( and created a few issues with my actual consulting work lol even upset some folks ).  
 So this time I’m keeping it limited I still want to help as many people as I can, just without burning myself out.

**About me:**  
 • 18 years in marketing  
 • Built and sold 2 companies  
 • Managed 9-figure ad spend (currently in the 8-figure range)  
 • Worked across every major platform  
 • Experience building, buying, scaling, and exiting businesses  
 • Former Director of Performance Marketing at PDI  
 • Former Director of Marketing at Acquisition

  
Been deep in my own projects lately and realized I really miss helping people directly. Took me a few months to recover from the last batch. As well as holidays and family.

If you’re stuck, want clarity, or need another set of eyes on something, I’m happy to look at it.  
 Again it’s free, and limited to 30 minutes so I can help as many as possible without overloading myself.

Drop a comment and let’s see if I can help you pull the right lever.

If I had gotten too busy in the past and had not gotten back to you please feel free to reach out again.

🚨EIC Accelerator: Opportunities in Times of Rest🚨,"https://preview.redd.it/ij9qbrydzx4g1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=29cf7530571541f00541bb3198b02d8fdf795689

With the EIC Accelerator, there are always opportunities. Whenever the EIC makes significant changes or launches a new work program, the budgets are refilled, and all applicants, including consultancies, have to adjust.

📊 Competitiveness By Cut-Off

It is easy to forget that you do not compete against all EIC Accelerator applicants. You only compete against the applicants who apply to the same deadline. If you happen to pick a deadline that is less competitive, your chances will increase.

When the budgets increased in 2021 and the evaluation process changed entirely, the first deadline was a major opportunity with success rates significantly higher than those before (i.e., over 5% in 2021 vs. less than 1% in 2020). Since many applicants and consultancies could not adapt to the changes in time and had to postpone their submissions, success rates were more than five times higher in the first cut-off of 2021 compared to the last one in 2020.

🚀 Why Start Now

Here is why it is a good idea to start applying now, and why the upcoming deadline might be a good opportunity:

💰 Budget: The budget in 2026 stays high at €634 million compared to 2025, but the EIC Accelerator Open Call budget has increased by €30 million in 2026.

🔄 Changed Process: The application process comes with a different Step 1 template (i.e., the structure and evaluation have changed recently) and a new Step 2 process (i.e., increased due diligence, a new template, and new evaluation criteria), leading to confusion among those unfamiliar with the changes.

😴 Procrastination: During the holiday season, most companies will procrastinate on their proposal submission, and most consultants will be on holiday, so a large volume of applications might not make it to the next deadline at all.

🎯 How To Use The Opportunity

Here is how you can use this opportunity:

The next Step 1 deadline is on January 6th, 2026, and you will obtain Step 1 results by mid-February.

If you pass Step 1, you are eligible to apply for Step 2 on March 4th and have a chance to make the first interview batch in April 2026, which is the first call of 2026, where EIC Accelerator winners will be decided.

As you can see, it all starts now. In order to have a chance to make the first batch of winners in 2026, you have to start preparing your proposal now and apply for Step 1 in early January.

While everybody else rests, you can seize the opportunity.

He doesn't leave our side, hates being alone in a room if he can't see us. Runs from one side of the living room where he plays to our laps on the couch m because he ""heard something and is scared"". 

Last night, we were having dinner and he jumped from his chair to my lap because he saw a shadow under the table. 

We are so tired. We tried a lot. When the nightmares started, we saw a sleep consultant. We read books about feelings and fear. We tried playing along by giving  him a cardboard sword to protect himself, an anri-minster spray. We draw monster and threw them in the bin.

We tried being rational and explaining that monsters don't exist and that it's his imagination at work. 

It is hard for me at night to take care of him and getting his Baby sister to sleep because he won't leave my side and won't stop fidgeting and talking 😭 it is also exhausting when my husband is away for work and I have to cosleep with both of them. 

Any suggestions are welcome ! Thx",pompom4678,1pcxyce,Parenting,03-12-2025,07:31:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1pcxyce/very_fearful_toddler_driving_us_crazy/

How much health info do I need to provide? How do I properly answer this question?,"Hi! First time getting life insurance here. Im getting it thru my work and they recently just sent me the eligibility form. Everything else is pretty cut and dry except this question. If I understand theyre basically asking if I have any diagnosed medical conditions within the last ten years and if Ive been prescribed any meds (part b does not apply to me)... how detailed do I need to be here? Im healthy mid twentys. Like do I need to tell them about every yeast infection, UTI, ear infection, etc. Ive had, I was technically prescribed antibiotics for them. Do I need to tell them about times like when I got an infected cat bite and had to go to the ER? That just feels like a lot and I dont want to give them a rundown of basically half my lifes  medical history if I dont need to, but I also dont want to die and then my family dosent get the money because I answered this question wrong.

Top 5 Courses to Consider for Your Future Career (Based on Current Industry Demand),"Every year, new career options appear, but only a few actually hold long-term value. While researching skill-based courses in Bangalore, I noticed a clear pattern across industries that are consistently hiring, evolving, and paying well. Below are five courses that seem genuinely future-proof based on current demand and industry growth. This is not a ranking, just a practical overview for students and career-switchers.

  


# 1. Digital Marketing

Digital marketing continues to grow because every business, whether a startup or a large brand, needs an online presence. From SEO and paid ads to social media and analytics, this field offers multiple career paths like performance marketer, SEO specialist, content strategist, and growth marketer.

One academy I explored for this space was **Web Marketing Academy (WMA)** in Bangalore. What stood out was their fully practical learning model with interactive classroom sessions, very small batches of 8 to 10 students, and over 40 modules covering the entire digital ecosystem. They focus heavily on real-time execution with live projects for each module, access to 50 plus marketing tools and 20 plus AI tools, and a strong emphasis on hands-on learning rather than theory.

Their faculty has over 12 years of experience, and they also offer lifetime mentorship along with placement support. The academy has been running since 2011 and has trained more than 6000 students so far, which gives it a strong alumni network. For anyone serious about building a long-term digital career, this kind of structured, practical exposure makes a difference.

  


# 2. Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

Data is now at the core of almost every industry. Data science and AI professionals are required in healthcare, finance, marketing, logistics, and even education. This field focuses on data analysis, machine learning, predictive modeling, and automation.

While this course demands stronger math and programming foundations, it also offers some of the highest-paying roles for freshers and experienced professionals alike. The learning curve is steep, but the career growth is equally high.

  


# 3. Cyber Security

With the rise of cloud computing, online payments, and digital infrastructure, cyber security has become a critical need. Companies are constantly hiring ethical hackers, security analysts, and network security professionals to protect their systems and customer data.

This field is particularly suitable for students from IT, computer science, or networking backgrounds. Certifications, real-world attack simulations, and continuous skill upgrades play a major role in building credibility here.

  


# 4. UI/UX Design

UI/UX design is one of the fastest-growing creative tech careers. Every app, website, and software product needs user-friendly design. UI/UX designers work on user research, wireframing, prototyping, and interface design.

This course is ideal for people with a creative mindset who also enjoy problem-solving. Compared to pure coding roles, UI/UX offers a balance between creativity and technology. The demand is especially high in startups and product-based companies.

  


# 5. Cloud Computing and DevOps

Most companies today rely on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Cloud computing and DevOps professionals manage servers, automation pipelines, deployments, and scalability.

This field is highly technical but offers excellent job stability and salary growth. It is especially relevant for those who want to build a long-term career in IT infrastructure and system automation.

  


# Why Digital Marketing Still Stands Out Among These Options

While all five courses are strong career choices, digital marketing has a few unique advantages. It is accessible to students from any educational background, does not require heavy programming skills, and offers faster entry into the job market. It also allows flexibility in working as a freelancer, consultant, agency professional, or even as an entrepreneur building your own brand.

Institutes like WMA make the learning more industry-aligned by focusing on practical execution, live tools, and real-world campaign exposure rather than just certificates.

  


# Final Thoughts

Among all future-ready skills, digital marketing continues to stand out for its low entry barrier, fast hiring cycles, and multiple career paths across industries. For students actively exploring [digital marketing courses in bangalore](https://www.webmarketingacademy.in/best-digital-marketing-courses-in-bangalore/), choosing a program that balances strong fundamentals with real-world execution will always offer the best long-term career value.",haste1vali,1pcxude,MarketingDigitalAds,03-12-2025,07:24:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingDigitalAds/comments/1pcxude/top_5_courses_to_consider_for_your_future_career/

SoCal Piriform Filler Recs,"Hi! I (29F) lost a significant amount of weight a few years ago and my already genetically prominent smile lines got reeeeeally deep even at rest and they age me by quite a bit. 

I’ve done microneedling with PRP, microneedling with PDGF/Ariessence, I use a red light therapy mask regularly, retinol regularly, and good skincare. I think it might be time for injectables. 

I’ve read the little triangles next to the nostrils called the piriform fossa is the best way to give projection to the area without bulk (Also I have good cheek volume already according to a few consults I’ve had, so no cheek filler needed). 

Trouble is I’m terrified of the risk of complication since this is one of the highest risk areas on the face to inject.

Thinking about revision,"I’m 10 months post op and pretty much hate the results. I’ve already had two consultations with two different surgeons so far and each of them have different approache to my problem. One of them suggested to uplift my bridge with rib cartilage, derotate the tip down and make nose a bit longer (not protruding). The other surgeon suggested to use my nose grafts to fix the bridge, deroted the tip and deconstruct it to make it appear less protruding. So my question is which approach is better and more effective to make my nose look better and more natural?",Massive_Classic8352,1pcxgsm,rhinoplastyquestions,03-12-2025,07:01:54,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pcxgsm

"If you’re confused about where to start with mutual funds or SIPs, I made something that might help","Hi everyone,

After helping families with their investments for **18+ years** as a **SEBI Registered Mutual Fund Distributor**, 

I noticed that most people don’t actually struggle with “investing” — they struggle with clarity.

People usually ask me things like:

• “Am I choosing the right fund for my goal?”  

• “How much SIP should I do for retirement?”  

• “Is my current portfolio too random?”  

• “Where do I even begin if I’m just starting out?”  



So recently I put together a very simple website where anyone can:

• Book a **free 1-on-1 consultation**  

• Ask questions about **SIPs**, **insurance**, **goal based planning** or **retirement**  

• Get clarity on fund selection or portfolio clean-up  

• Understand what’s suitable for their goals  

(no fees, no selling, no obligation)

PSA - Recently learned that inheriting non-Japanese pension income can lead to a huge tax bill,"My spouse and I had been planning to move to Japan quite soon. But, those plans have been put on hold. The reason we reluctantly gave up was that we found out that inherited future non-Japanese pension income (ie: social security from the US) would be taxed all at once as part of the inheritance tax calculations for the surviving spouse if they are a resident of Japan.

With a hefty deduction for the surviving spouse that potential extra taxation is usually not applicable. But, when it does apply the amount of tax can be quite problematic. A key reason is that often retirees have a lot of their net worth invested in tax sheltered investments, not all of which are easy to access on short notice. It can lead to a cascade of taxation from other nations in which assets are based if a lot of money needs to be pulled out in a short time frame to pay a very large inheritance tax bill. If a large tax bill cannot be paid in full by the due date then, of course, interest charges, penalties, and potential asset seizures are all on the table. We consulted with an international accountant who is working with retirees who, because of this particular tax law, and at a stage in their life when they can no longer work, find themselves unable to pay the inheritance tax that they owe.

Younger spouses who inherit a foreign-based pension will be the ones who get the largest bill, other things being equal, because their inheritance tax calculations will be based on the assumption of them living longer. As another issue that can create even more problems for younger spouses who lose their partner, tax is calculated using prevailing payout rates as a starting point for non-Japanese pensions. But, with US-provided social security in rough shape there is a good chance that benefits will be noticeably cut at some point in the future. Thus, it is conceivable that somebody could pay a hefty tax for their inherited ""spousal"" social security, only to see the benefits for which they paid taxes noticeably cut years down the road.

We are very glad and grateful to find this out before we moved to Japan. It seems relevant to ""pay it forward"" by sharing what we've learned because this particular part of Japanese inheritance tax law often seems to catch people by surprise and, for some, it can be financially very destructive.",InteRest_LEtuCe2467,1pcxe3f,JapanFinance,03-12-2025,06:57:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/1pcxe3f/psa_recently_learned_that_inheriting_nonjapanese/
Understanding Cat Foods Low in Phosphorus for Urinary Health," Anyone else have a super picky cat? This is the food that finally worked.

My cat was the pickiest eater imaginable—sniffing his food and walking away without a second thought. It drove me nuts trying different brands while worrying about his health (and my budget!). Then I gave Royal Canin Feline Urinary Care Adult Dry Cat Food a shot. He loves it so much that he cleans his bowl every single time now! His coat looks amazing, he's got more energy than ever, and I'm thrilled knowing he's getting what he needs.

At-a-GlanceWhen it comes to maintaining your cat's urinary health, diet plays a crucial role. Cat foods low in phosphorus are often recommended as they may help manage urinary conditions by supporting a balanced mineral intake.

EU ARs and AI: Compliance to Competitive Advantage,"EU authorised representatives are becoming a strategic asset for medtech and AI innovators, not just a regulatory checkbox. When combined with the right AI consultant and digital tools, the Authorised Representative (AR) can unlock faster EU market access, stronger post‑market surveillance, and a more resilient business strategy around your medical or AI device.​

# Why the EU Authorised Representative matters

Under the EU MDR and IVDR, any non‑EU manufacturer must appoint a single EU Authorised Representative before placing devices on the European market. This partner becomes your official face to regulators, responsible for holding technical documentation, supporting conformity assessment, and responding to competent authorities.​

Because the AR shares liability, regulators expect them to deeply understand your device, risk profile, and clinical use. For AI‑enabled and software devices, this includes lifecycle documentation, data governance, cybersecurity controls, and alignment with the evolving AI Act.​

# Beyond compliance: a data and AI opportunity

EUDAMED and other regulatory databases are often seen as “just another admin burden.” In reality, the structured data your AR helps maintain (UDI, incidents, vigilance, economic operators) can become a strategic analytics layer for your business if you design for it.​

Here is where an AI consultant changes the game:

* Transform regulatory data into dashboards for incident trends, complaint hotspots, and field safety signals.​
* Use AI solutions to automate checks on documentation completeness, labelling consistency, and change impact analysis across your portfolio.​
* Apply predictive models to prioritise post‑market actions and market expansion decisions, rather than reacting to issues one by one.​

# What a modern AR–AI consultant partnership looks like

Forward‑thinking Authorised Representatives, such as MedQAIR, already combine regulatory expertise with software and AI know‑how for MDR, IVDR and the AI Act. They support economic operators across the chain and use platforms to manage registration, documentation, and evidence in one place.​

When you add an independent AI consultant into this mix, you can:

* Build AI solutions that sit on top of your regulatory platform to monitor signals, documentation status, and audit readiness in near real time.​
* Align AI product design, data strategy, and go‑to‑market with EU requirements from day one, instead of retrofitting compliance later.​
* Design business strategy around “compliance by design,” using regulatory strength as a differentiator in tenders, partnerships, and reimbursement conversations.​

# Turning compliance into competitive advantage

For founders and regulatory leaders, the question is no longer “Do we need an Authorised Representative?” but “How do we turn that relationship into a strategic engine for growth?” A strong AR, paired with AI‑driven tooling and expert AI consulting, helps you:​

* Enter the EU faster while reducing rework and regulatory surprises.​
* Prove control over MDR, IVDR and AI Act expectations in a way that scales with your pipeline.​
* Use regulatory, quality, and post‑market data as a strategic asset instead of letting it sit in static PDFs and siloed systems.​

For medtech and AI innovators, the AR is no longer just an address on your label. Treated strategically and augmented with AI solutions, it becomes a core pillar of your business strategy for building trust, accelerating market access, and staying ahead of the next wave of EU regulation",Express_Meal_2002,1pcxd52,TheLinkDrop,03-12-2025,06:55:43,https://i.redd.it/7xz2rf5msx4g1.png

"“Birmingham PD does not make available any data on officer involved shootings, arrests, calls for service and 911, crime and crime mapping, traffic and pedestrian stops, training, or policies.” (Vera Institute of Justice 2023)","[“The better the police can be on **transparency** the fewer worries citizens will have.”
– Diana Dolliver, assistant professor of criminology and criminal justice at University of Alabama (2019)] 

*TLdr: Birmingham, AL has become a municipal “black box”, operating as one of the least transparent major cities in the country: the police release no crime data, no use-of-force records, no traffic-stop numbers, not even basic crime mapping; the mayor claims crime is down but BPD says the data is “not yet available”; journalists can’t get interviews or records; families can’t obtain body-camera footage; ShotSpotter contracts and surveillance-camera locations are hidden; the city funneled $1.8 million into friendly newspapers while investigative coverage dried up; and even the Alabama Legislature is now trying to force agencies like BPD to disclose basic staffing information because Birmingham refuses to. What the city calls transparency is really a strategy of delay, denial, secrecy, and PR—a government that monitors its residents while refusing to let its residents monitor it.*

Birmingham’s leaders talk a big game about transparency. City Hall invokes the word the way a magician invokes smoke—something to distract the audience while the real trick happens out of sight. But transparency here is not a value. It is a slogan, repeated often and delivered rarely, a marketing term deployed to mask a public-safety regime that is as secretive as any in the Southeast.

Every week, someone asks the same anxious question on r/Birmingham or Nextdoor: **“Is [this neighborhood] safe?”** The answers are always a blur of anecdotes, news stories, and strong opinions—anything but data. This cycle of uncertainty might be funny if it weren’t also a symptom of something deeper: Birmingham, despite all the talk about “public safety,” is one of the least transparent big cities in America when it comes to police data.

When the Birmingham City Council voted to extend the East Lake barricades in October 2024, Mayor Randall Woodfin could not provide information to support claim that the program had reduced gun violence. When queried by Councilwoman Smitherman the mayor acknowledged he didn’t have the stats, stating only that the city “believed” it had worked, and admitting that actual crime data varied in terms of the program’s **primary goal** of reduced shootings, from one month to the next. Nevertheless, the Council passed the extension by unanimous vote as a routine consent item, along with the promised public hearing to consider permanent street closure.

The Vera Institute of Justice lays it out with clinical precision:

[“**Birmingham Police
Department** does not make available any data on officer involved shootings, arrests, calls for service and 911, **crime and crime mapping**, traffic and pedestrian stops, training, or policies.”
– Vera Institute of Justice† (2023 Police Data Transparency Index)]

In 2025, in a major American city, the police produce no public data at all—nothing to show how they use force, where they patrol, who they stop, or what crimes are happening where. LexisNexis’ Community Crime Map, used nationwide for basic public information, is even blunter: 

[“There is currently **no agency data** coverage available for the selected area [Birmingham,AL].“
– LexisNexis® Community Crime Map]

It is as if Birmingham has been cut out of the map entirely.

Despite this blankness, Mayor Woodfin stood at a podium earlier this year and assured residents that crime is down—way down—except for homicide, which “overshadowed everything else.” ABC 33/40 did what any credible outlet should do: it requested the data behind the mayor’s claims. The response from Birmingham Police? “The data is not yet available.” Every other city in Alabama can produce them on demand. Only Birmingham, somehow, cannot. Meanwhile, Woodfin himself hasn’t responded to the station’s weeks-long request for an interview. Transparency, in Birmingham, is something to promise in speeches and dodge in practice.

This blackout would be shocking enough on its own. But it sits atop something even more troubling: a public-safety apparatus that grows more secretive by the year. When the city decided to install nearly 100 surveillance cameras—high-resolution units with license plate recognition, integrated with ShotSpotter—the residents were not told. Neighborhoods were not consulted. City councilors were briefed in executive session, then rubber-stamped it. The cameras’ locations “won’t be disclosed.” The footage is exempt from public records law. The Montgomery Advertiser reported flatly that the mayor’s office has designated the video “confidential.” Surveillance is public; accountability is secret.

Criminal justice experts called Birmingham’s rollout “textbook everything you shouldn’t do.” Residents, excluded from the process, said the obvious: “The leadership isn’t communicating.” They weren’t supposed to. The point of a silent expansion of surveillance is not public safety—it is control without consent.

At the same time that Birmingham was obscuring crime data and building a clandestine camera network, Woodfin’s administration was quietly transforming the media environment meant to hold him accountable. Ban Balch & Bingham revealed that the city funneled $1,815,170.84 to the Birmingham Times during Woodfin’s tenure. Afterward, the paper shifted almost entirely to “Happy News”—cheerful lifestyle features devoid of scrutiny, criticism, or investigative reporting. The Times does not disclose where the money went. The foundations involved do not disclose it. And AL.com, after entering a content-sharing arrangement with the Times, began offering its own polished, flattering coverage of Woodfin—right as the city doubled its payments to the Times’ entities.

The arrangement is unmistakable: a financially distressed media ecosystem propped up with taxpayer dollars, softened, aligned, and laundered into a PR arm for the mayor. As the investigation put it, AL.com and the Birmingham Times have “showered Woodfin with consistent and favorable news coverage, at taxpayers’ expense.” All of this while Woodfin’s administration was, as AL.com itself once acknowledged, “stonewalling and ignoring legitimate public information requests.” The watchdog has been brought to heel.

Consider the ShotSpotter scandal. In 2017, Fox 6 requested data, contracts, and correspondence related to the system—a normal request in any functioning democracy. Under Mayor Bell, they were told they could have it. Under Woodfin, they received “a whole lot of nothing.” Years went by. Letters were sent. Threats of litigation issued. The administration finally denied the request outright, even the request for the contract itself—a document the previous administration considered public. Every step of the way, the city relied on delay, deflection, and the thin pretext of “security.” Anything to avoid the public seeing how its money is spent.

Even the Alabama Legislature appears fed up. In February 2025, state lawmakers—who are hardly champions of civil liberties—advanced a bill that would require law enforcement agencies to publicly report staffing numbers because so many agencies, including Birmingham’s, refuse to disclose even the number of officers they employ. The state had to consider a law compelling what should be the bare minimum: telling the public how many police officers work in their own communities. It is astonishing that such a bill is even necessary. It is even more astonishing that in Birmingham, it is.

And then there are the body cameras—a reform sold to the public as a transparency tool. WBRC reported this summer that Birmingham residents and families of people shot by police cannot obtain the footage. In cases where officers kill citizens, families beg for video. The city delays. The city redacts. The city withholds. The mayor’s office shields. WBRC had to run a segment titled “Your Side Calls for More Transparency” because BPD would not answer basic questions about footage that belongs to the public. A mother whose son was shot by Birmingham police said, with shaking hands and a breaking voice in a 2021 interview: “I just want to see my baby.” She was told nothing. She was given nothing. Her grief, like her son, was swallowed by the city’s machinery of secrecy.

It is not a new pattern. Birmingham police killed Desmon Ray Jr. in 2021. His family demanded answers. They received silence. Black Lives Matter Birmingham called for the resignations of the mayor and the police chief for the stonewalling and the lack of answers. Nothing changed. The mayor issued statements about “healing.” The city released no meaningful information. The press wrote stories about a community abandoned by the very officials who claim to champion transparency and reform.

This silence becomes even more grotesque when placed against the backdrop of the city’s own homicide numbers. When Woodfin took office in 2017, he stood on the steps during his inauguration and declared that violence would be addressed decisively. “I can show you better than I can tell you,” he said. The city recorded 111 homicides that year. Every year since then has been worse. The numbers are public, because homicide tallies must be: 109 in 2018. 104 in 2019. 126 in 2020. 129 in 2021. 142 in 2022. 135 in 2023. Then the unfathomable: 148 murders in 2024, the highest in decades.

[“We requested **crime data** from Birmingham police… BPD says **the data is not yet available**.”
– ABC 33/40 (2025)]

He did not show us better. He did not even tell us.

Instead, he now says that “crime is down overall,” citing reductions in rape, assault, and auto theft—statistics which cannot be verified because the Birmingham Police Department will not release them. ABC 33/40 asked for the numbers. The department stalled. Then declared, incredibly, that “the data is not yet available.” These are not obscure metrics. These are monthly crime stats that every major city in America publishes as a matter of routine governance. Birmingham does not.

The mayor insists that solving gun violence requires more than policing. He says it requires community-wide cooperation. Legislative assistance. Neighborhood cohesion. Systemic change. All of that is true. But it is also a deflection from the central fact: city officials cannot ask for public trust while refusing basic public information. They cannot ask residents to collaborate when they will not even tell them how many homicides occurred in their neighborhood last month. They cannot ask the public to “come together” while hiding footage, data, numbers, and policy decisions behind closed doors.

This is the same Birmingham that secretly installed nearly 100 Alabama Power–owned surveillance cameras with undisclosed locations, withheld the camera contract for years, exempted camera footage from public records law, and briefed the city council on the program in executive session so residents would not hear a word about it until it was already done. The same Birmingham where ShotSpotter records were withheld for three years until the Woodfin administration finally denied the request outright, claiming “security exemptions.” The same Birmingham where the mayor’s multimillion-dollar payments to local media outlets produce a steady stream of “Happy News” while investigative journalism dries up.

Birmingham’s contempt for transparency is not an anomaly; it is a lineage. In 1963, when activists traveled to Washington for the March on Washington, Birmingham police secretly sent an officer 700 miles to surveil them. Slate recently resurfaced the images—twenty covert photographs showing unsuspecting marchers, snapped by a Birmingham cop who had no jurisdiction and no reason to be there except to spy. The tools have changed. The impulse has not.

Today, Birmingham is a black box. Crime data is withheld. Use-of-force data is withheld. Surveillance camera locations are withheld. Surveillance footage is withheld. ShotSpotter records are withheld. Contracts are withheld. Public records requests go unanswered for years. Journalists’ questions go unanswered entirely. The mayor’s office insists on transparency, while governing through secrecy.

And yet residents are expected to trust the city’s assurances about crime, about safety, about surveillance, about how their money is being spent and what tools are watching them. Trust is not built on speeches. It is built on access. On sunlight. On accountability. Birmingham has chosen the opposite: a city where the government monitors the public, and the public is denied the right to monitor the government.

A city cannot be safe if it is not honest. And Birmingham, today, is not honest. Until this administration releases full police data, full surveillance policies, and full contracts—not excuses, not slogans—their claims are just that: claims. The truth is not “not yet available.” It is simply being withheld.

In 2019, when public records journalist Freddy Martinez submitted a request to the Birmingham Police Department seeking documents on the city’s possible use or solicitation of facial recognition software, the city’s communications director, Rick Journey, responded with a statement that has aged into something far more revealing than he intended: “Based on our research, the city does not currently use such technology and is not currently in the process of acquiring such technology, therefore these records do not exist.” It is the kind of bureaucratic sentence engineered not to clarify, but to end the conversation. The city, Journey claimed, was not using facial recognition, was not trying to use it, and had nothing on its radar even tangentially related to it.

The denial was so emphatic it should have raised suspicion immediately. But Birmingham has trained its residents to accept non-answers as answers, silence as policy, and loopholes as governance. When Martinez appealed, explaining that he had also requested communications about potential implementation—such as unsolicited proposals, marketing materials, or vendor outreach—the city fired back with the procedural escape hatch that Alabama agencies have used for decades: they insisted that he had not used the “official” form. As though the form—not the request—were the obstacle preventing the public from learning whether the police were considering a technology capable of scanning every face in a city without consent.

The message was unmistakable: We’re not going to tell you anything. Not because there’s nothing to tell, but because we don’t feel obligated to tell you.

Birmingham is not suffering from a crime problem alone. Birmingham is suffering from a secrecy problem so entrenched, so normalized, and so politically useful that it has become a governing philosophy.",drew_incarnate,1pcxcd8,alabamabluedots,03-12-2025,06:54:25,https://i.redd.it/tj3v0t1jsx4g1.jpeg
"As a cancer patient and a medical professional, it breaks my heart seeing treatment delays","I’m a cancer patient and a medical professional and it honestly hurts to see how long people in Western countries have to wait just to start treatment because of insurance or NHS delays. While they wait, their cancer doesn’t. Neither does their fear.

I’m from India, and here things are very different. You can see top oncologists almost immediately, and the costs are unbelievably low — often just $20–30 for a consultation. Treatments like chemo and scans are also far cheaper,some even 100 times cheaper ,yet the quality is just as good, and sometimes even better in many places.


Doctors always say early treatment is critical, but many people abroad lose precious months just entering the system.

It makes me wonder: why can’t patients start their treatment in a place like India — where care is fast, affordable, and high-quality — while they wait for their insurance or NHS approval? It could save so much time, and maybe even lives.

I do realize that it's hard to move even for few days and the support system is more at home, but delaying treatment feels unfair and wrong too.

And it's just not with cancer there are many diseases where urgent care is unavailable for people which leads to serious consequences.",DataAggressive8243,1pcxc7e,HealthInsurance,03-12-2025,06:54:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/1pcxc7e/as_a_cancer_patient_and_a_medical_professional_it/

Sleep and 2 year olds,"Hi, me, again. I deleted last night's rushed post because I'm really ashamed of myself. 

I believe I came in looking for advice but I anxiously put my foot in my mouth. I've honestly felt like I haven't been the best mom in the last few months. I just got diagnosed with BPD after attempting to take my life back in August and I spent a week in the hospital, away from my son, getting better. My confidence as a mother is horrible and I still blame myself for nearly leaving him without one. I'm barely forgiving myself for that alone.

I just went to my therapist as well. The session was about parenting while being mentally disabled. My husband is autistic and I have major depressive disorder and now BPD as the wonderful cherry on top. But that is an explanation, I never want it to be an excuse for anything, especially anything involving the baby.

Upon diving into the sleep consulting I received, I honestly believe that one of the nurses were unprofessional and it doesn't state that I can't soothe him. https://www.ngala.com.au/sleep/

It bothered me that I had to beg to step in and hold him. 

As for the bed, I'd really love suggestions so I can better cuddle him to sleep. I've been getting ideas and we already have Bluey bedding.

I do receive assistance with my close friend/support worker. She's basically his aunt at this point. I want to discuss it as well in a constructive way, also informed. I apologise for coming across as ignorant. I don't think I see recommendations for cio anymore and when we started really sleep training, I had a lot of concerns because all I'd read was about the mental impact. 

I want to educate myself on everything for his health. I've always hated being told I'm spoiling him by being his mother, if there's anything he needs me for, it's definitely comfort. 

In Australia, we have child health nurses and I will definitely talk about it with her. We're also needing to get information on starting to potty train. But now that everything is more stable in our lives, he definitely needs to be the primary focus.

Quick Prefecture Switch for PR Application?,"Hello everyone!

TLDR

I would like to know if some people have experienced moving temporarily their address to another prefecture (renting a cheap place) where waiting time to process the application would be much shorter than Tokyo (currently 2 years ish)

Details

So here’s my situation: I’ve been holding a HSP I visa for 1 year and a half with 80+ points and I was ready to apply for PR but unfortunately I got laid off so this might reset the 1-year period in case I find another job that allows me to justify a profile with 80+ points again.

I thought that being the PR all applications had to transit through Shinagawa at the national level but it seems that’s not the case and depending on which prefecture people apply from, they can get their PR approved within 6 months (4 the shortest I’ve seen).

Honestly, PR has been on my mind so I wouldn’t mind double renting, i.e. keeping my current place in Tokyo and renting another place, dirt cheap, in the middle of the countryside where I could get PR much faster.

I’d rent the place, change my address on my resident card, apply to PR, check once a month the mail box by going there and then once I get the PR “move back” by changing my address back to Tokyo.

Is it something that some people have already done? Would it look suspicious to the immigration to make such a move? Do I need to stay for at least a few months in a new address before being able to apply?

Note: I have an appointment with immigration lawyer this afternoon to clarify a few points about this but this is a 30-minute appointment so I don’t know whether we can cover it all.

I’m asking this because this is a very specific move and I couldn’t find specific experience feedback from any people online.

Thank you in advance for your help and advice!


EDIT After Consulting with Immigration Lawyer:

Because the immigration is checking proof of residency (住民票) it would look a bit suspicious to move too far and apply directly.

That being said, he mentioned that Kanawaga Area (Yokohama, etc…) + Machida (even though it’s Tokyo) are rattached to Kanagawa immigration office and since those areas are very close to Tokyo, it’s totally normal to move there for whatever reasons. 

Also at the moment I’m writing this Kanagawa is around 6-month processing VS a 18-month one for Tokyo.

If I want to speed it up moving to an area rattached to Kanagawa immigration would be the move according to him.

Hope it will help some people!",Iseril78,1pcx6yk,japanlife,03-12-2025,06:45:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/1pcx6yk/quick_prefecture_switch_for_pr_application/
Integrate BPD Predatory scammy practices- BEWARE,"Ashley Zahabian markets her “services” on social media such as tiktok. I came across her tiktok live talking about her program but wasn’t sure it was for me, she was marketing her “consultation”. I booked this to find out more information about the program and process. I do not have BPD, while when I was young and in an abusive relationship I met a lot of criteria, nearly 15 years of multiple modalities of therapy, professional evaluations and self work, I found I was just undiagnosed ADHD and had CPTSD from my childhood and that abusive relationship. 

I explained this to her in this conversation, and she insisted that this could help me too. That it was a generalized program to help with all kinds of trauma. I felt pressured during this because I wasn’t sure and wanted to think about it. In this zoom she emphasized and drove home that the goal was to sign me up no matter what because she thought I was a “good candidate”. I’m a disabled college student on a fixed income and she initially quoted me around 3000 for this program, and said financing through Affirm was pretty much the only option. Slowly over the course of this meeting she drove down the price until I finally agreed, still a 1500-1700 loan.

When I finally got access to the program I realized I didn’t need it, all the materials are things I had already worked on with multiple therapists, group therapy, self work, EMDR, etc. But, reaching out to Ashley didn’t work. “No Refunds”. But hey, I get lifetime access to a Discord server I guess 🤷‍♀️ only a cool ~1,700$ later.

I find this practice to be INCREDIBLY PREDATORY. People with BPD, ADHD, CPTSD can be a vulnerable population, looking for help only to have their symptoms like poor impulse control or their people pleasing from their trauma used for someone else’s gain. I tried to say no more than once, to think about the commitment but she kept insisting that there was no thinking about it. I either signed up right then and there or I wouldn’t be able to sign up at all at a later time! And of course she has you sign a contract. All in the name of helping others though. I see she has genuinely done some good for many people, but how many people that essentially got scammed are out there and just not saying anything? Either due to embarrassment or public/self stigma. Whatever the reason, I’m over it!!! 

I even reached out to her to ask to help with Affirm to release me. No help at all, Affirm said she had to refund me, again. No help at all. I couldn’t walk for 3 months, I have liver and kidney damage now from the health issues I was going through and she couldn’t even take a second to pause and think that maybe she screwed over someone who was already in a hard situation. Anyway, Ashley if you see this, love ya babe. Please be more conscientious of the pressure you are putting on people, it’s lowkey kinda evil. I’ve been paying this for 2 years and counting, and still unable to work. I looked into comments on Tiktok and looks like yeah! Others have been scammed by her pressure/urgency tactics too. Lovely. Hope this helps someone else avoid being scammed.

"As a cancer patient and a medical professional, it breaks my heart seeing treatment delays","I’m a cancer patient and a medical professional and it honestly hurts to see how long people in Western countries have to wait just to start treatment because of insurance or NHS delays. While they wait, their cancer doesn’t. Neither does their fear.

I’m from India, and here things are very different. You can see top oncologists almost immediately, and the costs are unbelievably low — often just $20–30 for a consultation. Treatments like chemo and scans are also far cheaper,some even 100 times cheaper ,yet the quality is just as good, and sometimes even better in many places.

Doctors always say early treatment is critical, but many people abroad lose precious months just entering the system.

It makes me wonder: why can’t patients start their treatment in a place like India — where care is fast, affordable, and high-quality — while they wait for their insurance or NHS approval? It could save so much time, and maybe even lives.

I do realize that it's hard to move even for few days and the support system is more at home, but delaying treatment feels unfair and wrong too.

And it's just not with cancer there are many diseases where urgent care is unavailable for people which leads to serious consequences.",DataAggressive8243,1pcx4b2,healthcare,03-12-2025,06:41:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthcare/comments/1pcx4b2/as_a_cancer_patient_and_a_medical_professional_it/

my ExtraEmily Award votes,"I add my short comment of each category. I was about to post this on discord but the wall of text would be annoying, so I post it here 😅

* Best Stream Arc: Elden Ring Marathon

Michelin Star not always on Mondays btw, and I don't trust Emily's taste bud, respectfully, but I enjoy her reactions anyway. Recently I watched Wake Wilder's stream in Michelin Star restaurant in Miami with Rage and Cyr. He described the tastes elegantly. I like when he talk about food like that 😅

I voted Elden Ring because I was there. My time zone is -11 from PST btw, I remember watched it on 3 or 4 AM. We got the cinematic gamer group orgasm clip beating that bitch Malenia.

* Most Embarrassing Stream Moment:  SAY IT

Drunk Emily is so different with regular Emily. We also see it with streamer univ party drunk moments, mad at a photographer, getting out from bus not noticing Kai, and then Nina feeding her pizzas. And also the weed segment on Rages's collab. Be careful dear.. 😅

* Best Michelin Star Stream: Houston Episode with Agent00

I like the episode within the context of the road trip. The restaurant environment was hot outside, but they still can enjoy the food. Btw don't forget the Michelin notebook was left behind in Rage's house, did she get it back yet?

* Best Streamer University Moment: Emily Raps at the Talent Show

Stand out as Asian doing rap. Emily entertained the crowd like she engaged with chat. Not great at vocals tbh, she's out of breath sometimes maybe because limited lung capacity and she also do the dances but her confidence cover all of those limitations and we got one of the best clip in Streamer University 2025.

* Most Disgusting Moment: Underwear Talk with MisterArther & Acie

Girl, you shouldn't talk abt this in public.. ICANT
If I done the same (reusing underwear) I wouldn't talk as if it's normal. 😅 But the Acie's expressions are priceless for the clip. And you got many underwears in PO Box after that.

* Best Elden Ring Marathon Moment: Malenia Defeated

Cinema.

* Best Athletic Moment: The Blob Launch

One of the best clip of the year. Thank god Emily didn't hurt from that. Thank you AT&T btw (it's also within one of the Always On episode, even tough we know she doesn't use AT&T on her phone 😅)

* Best Streamer Games Moment: The Winning Moment

""Being consistently good defeat the erratic great/bad team performance on each games"" iiTzTimmy's great team strategy. His archery was top notch.

Please don't vote the gymnastic disaster.. she and everyone else got mogged by Lily's dog. 😅

* Best “Monster” Reveal: KaiCenat & Davis

I like the context before the clip, Emily was getting super diligent energy and cleaning up the apartment in 1 day before Kai & Davis handing invitation to the party personally to her apartment. But it's maybe been messy again recently after the PO Box opening stream 😅

* Best Pokemon Go Marathon Moment: Goon Cave with Cinna

Literal Goo-n Cave. Also shout out to Rosii and Keem best cameramen for the hawaii marathon. sy-bao is our fav bao.

* Best TwitchCon Road Trip Moment: Dancing at the Bar

Cindy the bartender is lovely. Bonnie mogging and teaching everyone dance moves. The crazy frog remix was horrible. But we can't always have the good without sometimes also get the bad ones.

* Best Always On Episode: Drifting School

Haven't seen this episode. But the clip is cool. I'll check out the vod.

* Best Girly Pop Moment: Emily, Cinna & Maya hit the Catwalk

""Why they keep saying ""kiss""?"" 😅

* Best QT Concert Performance: Dance (Ass)

She got lucky with the outfit shopping before the event. She got the Suki pants and simple pink tank top, also got free pair of shoes (RIP CoolKicks the owner apparently done scam/fraud and arrested). Shoutout to ConnorEatsPants camera-manning when she's performing.

* Best Concept Stream: NYC Walk-a-Thon

But maybe put a cap on it to prevent abuse 😅. Haven't watch NPC and bike without map vod, they sounds so funny.

* Best Emily TikTok: Emily Aura Farming

As an Indonesian I'm biased coz the original Aura Farming kid is 11 tear old Indonesian boy.. 😅

* Best Emily Impression : Maya

* Best YouTube Thumbnail: Extra Emily & Agent Elden Ring Marathon Day 5

tbh I don't watch the official yt as often as I scrubbing the unofficial yt archive. The thumbnails are pretty good without using AI edit imo.

* Best City Emily Visited: NYC

* Best #AD Stream: King of Meat

Emily also hosted big ad events stuff like Level Reforge with Will Neff (crazy she done it right after Elden Ring Marathon), TwitchCon gameshow (where she slipped on stage), and maybe other ones I missed. Could be a category in ExtraEmily Award tbh. Maybe something like ""Best event hosted/cohosted by Emily""

* Best Friend in Austin: Misterarther

He seems like a dependable friend on and off stream. Especially when he's not doing clip farming collabs with pretty girl streamers and Dean. Emily is quite techie (she was a coder, right?) but sometimes she need a tech guy to fix camera and computers in the house she'll call Arther. He pretty much tend the OTK house and really use it in fillers time (they recently end the lease and give back the house to Jeremy the Swan). Some silly Emily collab in the house I remember with Arthur are the jetski streams, summer slip and slide competition, cardboard boat building that stretch out to 3 days, giant ball, and recent Soussé 5 course meal poison hazard risk restaurant. Arther was almost always there for Emily for her ""filler"" stream.

* Best Dress: Blue Dress From 2023 Streamer Awards

idc what Emily  think of it. It looks good. And it's sapphire-like in color. But she should dress with anything she's comfortable with, coz they said confidence is key. Maybe she should do a color analysis or hire a fashion professional, it maybe worth investment to consult them, and a good stream idea (coz we normies wouldn't do that, like we don't eat at michelin star restaurants, 😅)

* Best Male Collab: Agent00

Dap him up.

* Best Female Collab: Maya

Maya is the opposite of Emily in many things. Their conversation in car after Pumpkin Patch stream could be a mini podcast.

Love Emi when she teach Emily cosplays and collabs trying Michelin star Restaurants. She maybe the most frequent one to collab with Emily this year of this category nominations..

Fanfan is close second best imo, but she lives in Canada.
Fuslie present in spirit anytime Emily wears the iconic I Can't Drive hamster T-Shirt.
Cinna is busy with her own things, like abusing Rosii and spreading tortism. Emily and Cinna's recent tiktok brainrot collab is peak comedy. Tough competitor in Streamer Awards Sapphire Award this year.

* Best Stream: 17th Door with T10Nat and CarolineKwan

Watching the vod rn.

* Best Overall Clip: Emily Flies on a Water Slide

Ouch.

* Streamer of the Year: ExtraEmily (first choice)

I'm not troll voting for Russel guys, I swear.

* Other categories than can be considered for next year: Best piano segment, best event host/cohosted by Emily (example: Level Reforge, TwitchCon gameshow, etc)",armanke13,1pcwzr4,ExtraEmily,03-12-2025,06:33:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtraEmily/comments/1pcwzr4/my_extraemily_award_votes/

Flood Damage Restoration Oneonta: Mold Risks After a Flood and Prevention Tips,"When your Oneonta house experiences flooding, the water doesn't just sit on the floor - it seeps into the carpets, walls, and behind walls. You can feel that the moisture is gone, but in reality, it isn't, even when it looks completely dry. For this reason, mold is frequently a bigger problem than the actual flood. Mold will begin to grow in many homes within 24–48 hours, which can elevate a water issue into a potentially serious health and structural issue.

# How Mold Spreads in Flood-Damaged Homes?

Picture this: your living room feels dry, but beneath the floorboards, moisture is quietly spreading. In these moist, dark areas, mold grows. It can grow on drywall, wood, furniture, and even behind wallpaper. Without professional help, it’s almost impossible to spot or remove everything. That’s why [mold remediation in Oneonta](https://360propertyrestoration.com/tag/mold-remediation-contractors-oneonta/) is so important.

# Essential Prevention Tips for Homeowners

To keep mold from taking over, start with quick action. Open windows for airflow, run fans and dehumidifiers, and remove wet items as soon as possible. Avoid scraping or touching mold, as it may spread spores. For deep moisture and structural drying, certified [property restoration NY](https://360propertyrestoration.com/) specialists are your best support system. 

So, floods can turn your world upside down, and mold growth only adds to the stress. The good news? You don't have to deal with this situation on your own. If you act quickly and get the appropriate experts on your side, restoring your home will be much easier, safer, and far less stressful. That is where [360 Property Restoration](https://360propertyrestoration.com/) comes in.

"Tattoo Aftercare Guide: Healing Time, Scabbing & Peeling","Getting a new tattoo is exciting, but what happens afterward matters just as much as the artwork itself. Proper tattoo aftercare determines how well your ink heals, how vibrant it stays, and whether you run into complications. Many first-time clients have questions about **tattoo healing time**, **tattoo scabbing**, **tattoo peeling**, the right **tattoo care products**, and especially **how long after a tattoo can you swim**.

This comprehensive guide walks you through every stage so you can ensure your new ink heals beautifully and safely.

# Understanding Tattoo Healing Time

One of the most common questions new clients ask is about realistic [**tattoo healing time**](https://www.tattmagic.com/blogs/blog/how-long-does-it-take-for-a-tattoo-to-heal). While every person heals differently, most tattoos follow a general timeline:

# Days 1–3: Initial Healing Phase

This is when your tattoo is considered an open wound. The area will look red, swollen, and may ooze plasma or excess ink. This is completely normal. You’ll want to wash it gently with mild soap and lukewarm water, then apply a thin layer of recommended ointment or other **tattoo care products**.

# Days 4–14: Scabbing and Peeling Phase

This is usually the part people worry about the most. Your tattoo will form scabs and start peeling, similar to a sunburn. Although it may be tempting, avoid picking at the skin. Let it fall off naturally.

# Days 15–30: The Surface Layer Finishes Healing

Most tattoos look mostly healed on the surface within 2–4 weeks. However, the deeper layers of your skin continue healing for up to 3 months.

# Complete Healing

A tattoo is **fully healed** (both surface and deeper layers) in **2–3 months**, depending on placement, size, and your personal aftercare routine.

# Tattoo Scabbing: What’s Normal & What’s Not

[**Tattoo scabbing**](https://www.tattmagic.com/blogs/blog/the-ultimate-tattoo-scabbing-guide) is a perfectly normal part of the healing process. Your body is naturally closing the wound and repairing the skin barrier.

# Normal Tattoo Scabs

* Thin, light scabbing
* Scabs that fall off on their own
* Slight itching

These are all expected signs of a healthy healing tattoo.

# Signs of Trouble

If you notice any of the following, it may indicate an issue:

* Thick, raised scabs
* Scabs filled with yellow or green fluid
* Excessive redness or swelling around the tattoo
* Severe pain

In these cases, you should consult a tattoo professional or dermatologist.

# How to Care for Scabbing Skin

* Keep it clean with gentle washing
* Do not scratch or pick at the scabs
* Apply only a **thin** layer of aftercare products to avoid suffocating the skin

Let patience be your best tool during this stage.

# Tattoo Peeling: Why It Happens & How to Handle It

After scabbing, you will enter the [**tattoo peeling**](https://www.tattmagic.com/blogs/blog/tattoo-peeling-101-what-s-normal-what-s-not) phase. This is when your skin sheds the damaged outer layer, revealing the fresh, new skin beneath.

# What Tattoo Peeling Looks Like

* Flaky, white skin shedding
* Dull or cloudy appearance of the tattoo
* Mild itching

Again, all of this is normal. The “dull” look is temporary; your tattoo will brighten as your skin finishes regenerating.

# Tips for Managing Tattoo Peeling

* Avoid pulling peeling skin
* Moisturize regularly using proper **Tattoo Aftercare** products
* Use fragrance-free lotions
* Wear loose clothing to avoid friction

Peeling usually lasts about **3–7 days**, depending on your skin.

# How Long After a Tattoo Can You Swim?

One of the most crucial — and often misunderstood — aftercare rules involves swimming. People often ask, **“**[**How long after tattoo can you swim**](https://www.tattmagic.com/blogs/blog/how-long-after-tattoo-can-you-swim)**?”** The short answer: **Avoid swimming until your tattoo is fully healed on the surface**, which typically takes **2–4 weeks**.

# Why You Should Avoid Swimming

Pools, hot tubs, oceans, and lakes carry bacteria that can easily get into your open skin and cause infections. Additionally, chlorine and saltwater can fade or damage fresh ink.

You should especially avoid:

* Pools
* Hot tubs
* Lakes, rivers
* Beaches
* Long baths or soaking in tubs

Showering is fine as long as you keep the tattoo clean and avoid soaking it.

# Safe Rule of Thumb

**Wait at least 3–4 weeks or until all scabs and peeling are completely gone.**

# The Best Tattoo Care Products for Healing

Using the right [**tattoo care products**](https://www.tattmagic.com/collections/tattoo-care-products) can make a significant difference in how well your tattoo heals. Your skin needs hydration, protection, and the right ingredients to avoid irritation.

# Look for Products That:

* Are fragrance-free
* Contain moisturizing ingredients like shea butter, aloe, or ceramides
* Are specifically labeled for “[Tattoo Aftercare](https://www.tattmagic.com/)”
* Are gentle and non-comedogenic

# Avoid Products With:

* Alcohol
* Strong fragrances
* Petroleum-based products (unless recommended by your tattoo artist)
* Exfoliating ingredients like AHA/BHA

These can irritate your fresh tattoo or clog pores around healing skin.

# Essential Steps for Proper Tattoo Aftercare

Proper **Tattoo Aftercare** is a combination of hygiene, product use, and knowing what behaviors to avoid. Below is a simple yet effective routine:

# 1. Cleaning Your Tattoo

Wash your hands first, then gently clean your tattoo with warm water and fragrance-free soap. Pat dry with a clean towel.

# 2. Baby Your Tattoo for the First 48 Hours

Your tattoo artist may apply a bandage or protective film. Follow their instructions on how long to keep it on.

# 3. Apply a Thin Layer of Aftercare Product

Using too much ointment can clog pores, slow healing, or cause breakouts.

# 4. Wear Loose Clothing

Tight clothes cause friction and can pull off scabs prematurely.

# 5. Avoid Direct Sunlight

Fresh tattoos are extremely sensitive to UV light. Once healed, always apply SPF to maintain vibrancy.

# 6. Do Not Scratch or Pick

Even if itching becomes intense, scratching can damage the tattoo and cause uneven healing.

# What to Expect During the First Month of Healing

Here’s a quick overview of what’s normal:

# Week 1

* Soreness
* Redness
* Oozing plasma
* Initial scabbing

# Week 2

* Heavier scabbing
* Noticeable **tattoo peeling**
* Dryness and itching

# Week 3

* Peeling stops
* Tattoo may look cloudy or milky

# Week 4

* Skin surface looks healed
* Color begins to brighten

Even if your tattoo looks healed, remember that deeper layers are still repairing.

# Final Thoughts

A new tattoo is an investment — one that deserves proper care from day one. By understanding **tattoo healing time**, managing **tattoo scabbing** and **tattoo peeling**, waiting the right amount of time before swimming, and using high-quality **tattoo care products**, you ensure your tattoo stays sharp, vibrant, and healthy for years to come.

With the right **Tattoo Aftercare**, your new ink will heal beautifully and remain a source of pride long after the healing process is complete.",Available_Plum6354,1pcww5l,u_Available_Plum6354,03-12-2025,06:27:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Available_Plum6354/comments/1pcww5l/tattoo_aftercare_guide_healing_time_scabbing/

I had my procedure at **BT Plastic Surgery Clinic** with **Dr. Lee Seung-ho**, whom I originally found through an online forum.

When I first arrived in Korea, everything happened quickly—consultation, pre-op tests, and surgery the following day. The first two days were definitely the hardest because of the nasal packing. Breathing only through my mouth was uncomfortable, and even after the packing was removed, my nose felt dry and stuffy for a while. On day 7, Dr. Lee used an endoscope to clean the inside of my nose, which immediately made breathing easier. Since I had a **Septoplasty** as well (my septum was severely deviated), the improvement in breathing has been huge. Knowing that Dr. Lee is an **ENT** specialist really made me feel confident about that part.

During the two weeks I stayed in Korea, I went to the clinic almost every day for laser treatments. In between, I walked around, ate, and shopped nearby, so the days went by faster than I expected. Dr. Lee was patient, thorough, and always answered every question I had.

**Now, at 4 months post-op,** here are the main changes I’ve noticed:

* **Bridge:** Swelling has gone down a lot, especially from the front view. The bridge looks slimmer and more defined.
* **Tip:** The tip is smaller and more refined, though some swelling remains, which is normal at this stage.
* **Sensitivity:** Still a bit sensitive, but much better than in the earlier months.
* **Nostrils:** Slightly uneven, but likely swelling-related and improving gradually.
* **Scar:** The columella incision is much lighter and less noticeable. I’ve been consistently using silicone scar gel as instructed.
* **Breathing:** Still really good. I can breathe clearly and comfortably, which wasn’t the case before surgery due to my deviated septum.
* **Daily life:** I’ve returned to the gym and normal activities without issues.

For anyone curious, I did not get an implant in the bridge. My surgery included **hump removal, nasal bone osteotomy, tip plasty using donor cartilage, septoplasty, and alar rim lowering using ear cartilage**.

Overall, I’m happy with how everything is healing so far. I notice small but clear improvements each week, and I’m confident things will continue to refine over the next few months. I’ll probably share another update later as the swelling continues to settle.

Hope this helps anyone considering rhinoplasty in Korea!

How to deal with bone-crushing handshakes from men at work?,"I'm female. I meet tons of people in my line of work. Every now and then a guy will absolutely crush my hand when shaking it. I'm always in shock and usually can't talk while they do it because of the sudden crushing pain in my hand.

What's the best way to deal with this? It's really rare but also extremely painful and disturbing. It makes me nervous to shake hands if someone looks exceptionally strong.

Last time I couldn't make a fist or flex my fingers completely for a few days - it was a consultant who came to see us three times. I didn't know how to avoid shaking his hand the second time so I just pulled it away quickly so it wasn't as bad. His handshake was more just grabbing and holding/squeezing my hand to death. The third time I made sure my hands were full when he arrived and left. Even thinking about it brings a twinge back.

I do not have the strength to crush their hands back like some other men have told me they do in this situation.

Any helpful suggestions greatly welcomed!

Has anyone experienced urge incontinence or overactive bladder after Finasteride/Dutasteride use?,"I just got diagnosed with idiopathic OAB. I asked several urologists what caused it and they said they don't know for sure.

I admit that I have a lot of bad habits that may have contributed and while I was unable to find any clinical evidence that 5ARIs cause urge incontinence (in fact I know they improve urinary function for most people), the coincidence of when I started having symptoms prefectly coincides with when I've been around 5 months on Finasteride. If it happened before I started, or many years after, I wouldn't even think about it.


How my symptoms progressed:  
1-2 years ago, first noticed how urge is often triggered earlier:  
● by exposure to cold environments  
● by exposure to water (e.g. washing hands, gargling water, taking a shower)  
● when standing up after long sitting

Then just about more than 9 months ago I switched to Dutasteride and noticed:  
● extreme increase in overwhelming urge intensity  
● increased urination frequency  
● that when I attempt to reduce frequency by trying to hold it in and supress the urge, I can't successfully do so anymore and I start experiencing incontinence within 10 seconds  
● bladder feels hypersensitive and often feels heavier with a constant urge to go

Biggest and most annoying change is how overwhelming and non-resetting the urge is, and that I will surely experience leakage until I make it to the toilet to voluntarily void.

Has anyone else developed urge incontinence or overactive bladder months after starting Finasteride/Dutasteride and felt it was possibly in a way somehow an effect of that?

My urologists already tested me for any obstruction or infection and I didn't have either.
I also don't have any neurological symptoms outside of urination. My only imaging finding is bladder wall thickening and all the urologists I've consulted said it doesn't tell us anything.

It has been 9 months since I last took Finasteride, and 3 months since I last took Dutasteride. I haven't felt any better since stopping. (I never had any prostate problems and I only took Finasteride and Dutasteride to manage hair loss.)",geecee22,1pcwue0,FinasterideSyndrome,03-12-2025,06:25:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinasterideSyndrome/comments/1pcwue0/has_anyone_experienced_urge_incontinence_or/

"Invisalign in Monmouth, NJ: The Clear, Modern Solution for a Straighter Smile","Achieving a beautiful, straight smile has never been easier thanks to [Invisalign in Monmouth](https://teethtamersortho.com/invisalign/), NJ. This innovative orthodontic treatment uses a series of clear, removable aligners to gently shift teeth into the correct position—without the discomfort or visibility of traditional metal braces. Whether you’re a working professional, teen, or adult seeking a discreet way to straighten your teeth, Monmouth orthodontic practices offer personalized Invisalign treatments designed for comfort, convenience, and confidence.

https://preview.redd.it/cs0r296vmx4g1.png?width=575&format=png&auto=webp&s=956e599c36eb2f197bfd7382dea385ea1126cbd3

# What Makes Invisalign So Popular in Monmouth, NJ?

Patients throughout Monmouth County love Invisalign for its blend of aesthetics, technology, and lifestyle flexibility. Unlike braces, Invisalign aligners are nearly invisible, allowing you to straighten your teeth without drawing attention. The trays are made from smooth, medical-grade plastic that fits comfortably over your teeth, making it easier to speak, eat, and smile naturally during treatment.

# Benefits of Choosing Invisalign

# ✔ Virtually Invisible

The transparent design allows you to straighten your teeth without noticeable brackets or wires.

# ✔ Removable and Convenient

You can easily take out your aligners to eat, brush, floss, or attend social events.

# ✔ Comfortable Fit

The soft, flexible material reduces irritation and discomfort.

# ✔ Faster, Predictable Results

Advanced digital planning ensures precise movements and more efficient treatment.

# ✔ Perfect for Busy Lifestyles

With fewer office visits and easy maintenance, Invisalign fits seamlessly into daily routines.

# Who Is a Good Candidate for Invisalign?

Invisalign can effectively treat mild to moderate alignment issues, including:

* Crowded teeth
* Spacing or gaps

Residents of Monmouth, NJ can schedule a consultation to determine if Invisalign is the right solution for their smile goals.

# Your Invisalign Journey in Monmouth: Step-by-Step

# 1. Consultation & Digital Scans

Your orthodontist uses advanced imaging tools—often 3D digital scanners—to capture precise details of your teeth.

# 2. Personalized Treatment Plan

A digital model of your smile is created, along with a time-mapped series of aligners that guide your teeth into alignment.

# 3. Wearing Your Aligners

Each set of aligners is worn for 1–2 weeks for 20–22 hours per day. They work gently but consistently.

# 4. Progress Checkups

Short, periodic appointments ensure your teeth are moving as planned.

# 5. Final Results & Retainers

Once treatment ends, retainers are used to maintain your beautiful new smile.

# How Long Does Invisalign Take?

In Monmouth, NJ, the average Invisalign treatment lasts 6 to 18 months, depending on the complexity of the case. Minor alignment issues may take as little as a few months with Invisalign Express.

# Cost of Invisalign in Monmouth, NJ

The cost typically ranges from $3,500 to $7,000, depending on:

* Treatment complexity
* Length of treatment
* Provider expertise
* Number of aligners needed

Many orthodontic offices in Monmouth offer payment plans, flexible financing, and insurance assistance to make Invisalign affordable.

* Flexible appointments to accommodate busy schedules
* Comfortable, modern offices
* High success rates and customized treatment plans

Whether you want to enhance your smile for personal confidence, upcoming events, or long-term oral health, Monmouth providers deliver trusted, high-quality results.

* Nearly invisible

However, braces are often recommended for more complex orthodontic cases. Your Monmouth orthodontist can help you choose the best option.

Best AI Consulting Services in San Francisco for SaaS & Tech Startups [2026 Edition],"Let’s be honest ➡ finding the right [**AI partner in San Francisco**](https://imperoit.com/ai-development-company-san-francisco-ca) today feels a bit like dating in Silicon Valley. Everyone looks great on paper. Everyone says they do “cutting-edge AI.” Everyone promises transformation. But when it comes to actually shipping real, working AI into your SaaS product, the list of truly reliable partners gets a lot shorter… very fast.

After watching dozens of startups struggle, pivot, burn money & (in some cases) finally get it right ➡ here’s a practical 2026 list of AI consulting services in San Francisco that are actually helping SaaS & tech startups grow, not just experiment.

# 1. Impero IT Services

I am putting Impero IT Services at #1 for a very simple reason: They do not sell AI hype ➡ they deliver working, production-ready systems.

Why startups trust Impero in 2026:

* They start with business problems, not algorithms. Revenue, churn, automation, cost reduction ➡ that’s their entry point.
* Strong expertise in Generative AI, predictive analytics, AI chatbots, recommendation engines & custom ML models.
* They integrate AI directly into existing SaaS platforms instead of forcing full rebuilds.
* Their team balances data science + software engineering, which most AI-only firms struggle with.
* Communication is clear, honest & startup-friendly ➡ no enterprise red tape.
* They scale with you: MVP → Growth → Enterprise.

If you are a SaaS founder who wants AI that actually works in production (not just fancy demos), Impero is hands-down one of the safest & smartest partners to work with in 2026.

# 2. Turing AI Labs

Strong in AI talent deployment & fast prototyping.  
Good for startups that already have a technical vision but need elite ML engineers to accelerate execution.

# 3. Accel AI Consulting

Well-known for data strategy + AI roadmap development.  
They are excellent at helping startups figure out *what* to build with AI before a single line of code is written.

# 4. Slalom AI

Enterprise-grade AI consulting with strong cloud + data engineering capabilities.  
Great for startups moving into large-scale deployments or regulated industries.

# 5. Xyonix AI

Focused on AI automation & operational intelligence.  
Good fit for SaaS companies optimizing internal workflows, DevOps automation & large data pipelines.

# 6. Cognizant AI Lab

A big-name option with deep research capabilities.  
More suitable for well-funded, later-stage startups that need heavy data & compliance support.

# Why These AI Consultants Stand Out in 2026

The AI space has matured fast. In 2026, startups no longer want:  
❌ AI experiments  
❌ Shiny POCs that never scale  
❌ Overpriced research-heavy models

They want:  
✅ AI embedded into real products  
✅ Scalable infrastructure  
✅ ROI-driven automation  
✅ Predictable costs  
✅ Fast iteration  
✅ Real user impact

Every company on this list has consistently shown the ability to move beyond hype and into real-world delivery.",ImperoIT,1pcwstw,TechUSA,03-12-2025,06:22:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechUSA/comments/1pcwstw/best_ai_consulting_services_in_san_francisco_for/

Is construction consulting in NYC worth considering for a project?,"Yes — especially in a city with complex building codes and high-density construction. Construction consulting in NYC provides guidance on project planning, scheduling, budgeting, and risk management. Consultants help foresee potential problems, like permit delays or contractor conflicts, and suggest strategies to avoid them. They also assist with coordination among architects, engineers, and contractors, keeping the project organized. By improving communication and resource management, construction consulting ensures projects run more efficiently, reducing the chance of cost overruns or schedule setbacks.

4 Months After My Rhinoplasty in Korea – Honest Review of BT Plastic Surgery,"I’m currently 4 months post-op after getting my rhinoplasty done in Korea, and I wanted to share my nose job  review for anyone who’s researching clinics or planning to travel for surgery. I had my procedure at BT Plastic Surgery Clinic with Dr. Lee Seung-ho, who I originally found through an online forum.

* Breathing: Still really good. I can breathe clearly and comfortably, which wasn’t the case before surgery because of my deviated septum.
* Daily life: I’ve gone back to the gym and normal activities without any issues.

For anyone curious, I did not get an implant in the bridge. My surgery included hump removal, nasal bone osteotomy, tip plasty using donor cartilage, septoplasty, and alar rim lowering using ear cartilage.

Overall, I’m happy with how everything is healing so far. I see small but noticeable improvements each week, and I’m confident things will keep refining over the next few months. I’ll probably share another update later on as the swelling continues to settle.

Hope this helps someone who’s considering getting rhinoplasty in Korea!

"The story of common people who stopped fascist insurrection: “Don’t worry, our soldiers and police aren’t like that.”","On the night of December 3 last year, when the illegal emergency martial law was declared, an unexpected battle began inside and around the National Assembly building in Yeouido, Seoul. Some rushed over on their way home from work, some left their families behind, and others were already in the building when they heard the news. Their ages and occupations differed, but they all ran toward the same place with one shared conviction: **“The National Assembly must not fall.”**

To mark the first anniversary of martial law, the Dong-A Ilbo reporting team met with 15 citizens who were at the National Assembly that night. Martial law lasted about 2 hours and 30 minutes, from its declaration to its lifting. The citizens recalled feeling *bewilderment* at first, then *solidarity* as they gathered, and finally *relief and overwhelming emotion* when martial law was rescinded. The soldiers and police officers who had blocked them spoke of *pain* and *regret*.

At 10:27 p.m., labor attorney Kang Young-su (33) was awakened by a call from his brother.  
“They declared martial law….”  
He didn’t have time to process the thought. He simply grabbed his shoes. On the 30-minute drive from his home in Gangnam to the National Assembly, he left a short will on KakaoTalk:  
“I’m scared. I don’t know what’s right. I’m just moving.”

Some ignored their families’ pleas and chose courage. Oh Su-jeong (49), mother of four, instantly imagined a grim future the moment she heard the news. She refused to let her children grow up in such a country. As she hurriedly slipped on her shoes at home in Yongin, her youngest daughter, still a middle schooler, wrapped herself around her mother’s leg.  
“Mom, what if something dangerous happens to you?”  
Oh tried to remain calm.  
“Our soldiers and police officers… they’re not that kind of people. Don’t worry.”

Graduate student Kim Gyuri (25) spent an hour thinking before deciding:  
“I won’t be able to sleep anyway—might as well add another head to the crowd.”  
Her mother texted:  
“Things feel unsettling. Don’t go outside.”  
Kim replied “Okay,” and left.

In Goyang, private Korean-language academy owner Choi Young-shin (41) quietly slipped out without waking his pregnant wife—he could not bring himself to say he was heading to the National Assembly.  
“If armored vehicles broke through, I thought I’d block them with my own car,” he said.  
Han Il-hwan (25), an aspiring history teacher, drove a rental car four hours through the night from Gyeongsan, thinking of his future students.

They arrived near midnight. Outside the National Assembly walls, facing soldiers and police across barricaded gates, the citizens felt both tension and solidarity.

Kim Won-kyung (44) and Bang Hee-jun (48), a married couple, stuffed a week’s worth of diabetes medication into a pocket before leaving their home in Gangdong—just in case they were detained. They were afraid. But the moment they saw a taekwondo black belt tied to the wall—left by a citizen who had already climbed over—it steadied them. Gripping the improvised “ladder,” they scaled the wall.

In front of the main gate, a “three-layer human scrum” formed to block military and police entry.  
Lee Seok-chan said he initially trembled with fear, wondering, “What if the vote fails and we’re all arrested?”  
But looking around, he realized everyone else had come with the same fear—and that, strangely, gave him courage.  
“Well, if we get taken, we get taken. They’re not going to kill us, right?”  
With that mindset, he joined the scrum.

Citizens also worked to prevent clashes with the authorities.  
Whenever tensions rose, Kang the labor attorney said, “it was actually the civilians who calmed the police.”  
People kept saying, “They were dragged out here too—they must be confused.”

There were also unknown helpers inside the Assembly. To swiftly rescind martial law through a plenary vote, they needed personnel to run the electronic voting system.  
Lee Gwang-bok, an executive at Daeshin Information & Communications (58), was one of them.

When he arrived around 11:40 p.m., another citizen helped him over the wall.  
As Lee shouted, “I need to get inside,” an elderly man signaled with his eyes. Lee understood the meaning:  
*“I’ll hold them. Go.”*  
Using the barricade as a stepping stone, he climbed the wall and sprinted to the main building. Inside, he managed to get the voting system running just in time and not a single voting terminal malfunctioned. It felt like divine luck.

At 1:01 a.m. on December 4, the vote to rescind martial law passed. The citizens waiting outside exhaled in collective relief. Some burst into tears.  
Lee said, “Right after the vote passed, the sighs of relief were louder than the cheers.”  
Then someone outside began singing the national anthem, and hundreds joined.  
Park Min-sang said, “The very fact that angry citizens still existed and could still move felt like hope.”

But even after martial law was lifted, few went home. There was a lingering fear that the President, as commander-in-chief, might declare martial law again.  
Administrative consultant Han Kwang-seop (56) recalled, “Looking back, sure, there was a sense of victory. But at the time, the fear of ‘a second martial law’ was much stronger.”  
So most stayed until dawn.

“Can the present help the past? Can the living save the dead?”  
Four days later, novelist Han Kang asked this in her Nobel lecture in Sweden.  
For the citizens who had rushed to the National Assembly, their experience that night became one answer to that question.

Father Hwang In-su (57), who witnessed the Gwangju Uprising firsthand at age 14, said:  
“I have lived my whole life remembering those who died that day. If someone couldn’t protect them then, I had to protect this now.”  
“I remember the courage and fear of the adults in 1980, and the silence that followed. This time, I did not want to stand on the side of silence.”

Lee Gwang-bok said, “Because I knew history, I could judge how to act that night.”  
He added, “One day, this too will become the past—and perhaps it will help save another future.”

One year later, all 15 citizens emphasized one truth:  
**“It wasn’t special heroes, it was ordinary people, stepping out of their everyday lives, who stopped martial law.”**  
And they warned:  
**“The lights and voices that filled the National Assembly that night must not be forgotten. Only then can democracy survive the next emergency.”**

A year after the illegal martial law declaration, those who confronted armed troops at the National Assembly have returned to their daily lives. But that night remains not just an event, but a deeply personal memory shaping who they are. Running, pulling, blocking, and standing together outside the Assembly rekindled their trust in Korean society and instilled pride in “the self who was there.”

Kim Young-wan (51), a security official at the National Assembly, still works there today. Calming angry visitors and patrolling the dark, empty halls at night—his routine hasn’t changed.  
But the meaning has.  
“Before, the Assembly was just my workplace,” he said. “Now I feel a clear sense of duty—guarding the core space of our democracy.”

Graduate student Kim Gyuri is now busy preparing for her thesis defense. She had lived mostly detached from politics before martial law—but afterward she began attending rallies and meeting people.  
“At a time when the thesis review was weighing heavily on me, solidarity with citizens gave me positive energy,” she said.  
“The biggest change is that now I have a moment I can be proud of.”

To them, that night has become a memory that sustains both democracy and themselves.  
Choi Young-shin said he endured nightmares of military helicopters chasing him for weeks afterward—but witnessing soldiers and police refuse unjust orders deepened his trust in society.  
Han Il-hwan said, “Knowing I played a part in stopping martial law has become the drive that pushes me toward becoming a teacher who helps students think critically.”  
Labor attorney Kang said, “The biggest achievement was that the nation collectively reaffirmed what should *never* be done.”",Freewhale98,1pcwm4j,SocialDemocracy,03-12-2025,06:11:47,https://www.donga.com/news/Society/article/all/20251202/132885012/1

"2015 Retina MacBook 12"" (8,1) - Arch Linux","Hello Redditors,

In an effort to make sure my old MacBook is not just a useless piece of modern e-waste, I have successfully installed Arch Linux, however I find that this model is notorious for having issues with drivers, so I have decided to document my journey here. I would love and appreciate any help from other Redditors coming across the same issues as myself.

To start, I first had to overcome this mess:

    [    0.000001] applespi spi-APP000D:00: SPI transfer timed out
    [    0.000002] spi_master spi1: failed to transfer one message from queue

Unfortunately, switching to another TTY using ctrl-alt-f2 would not stop the continuous loop of error messages. I was able to get around that by SSHing into the Install ISO. I plugged in an Ethernet Adapter by j5create that I bought from Best Buy to get the MacBook connected to the internet. I chose this one because it is natively compatible with Linux. Also, I did not want to bother with iwctl (ISO-only networking tool) so I opted for the adapter.

Thankfully, any commands you type in will run, even though the error loop takes up lines of text. After establishing the network connection, I set a password using ""passwd"" and then ""ip a"" to get my local IP address.

Using another device, I successfully established an SSH connection to the MacBook running the Arch Install ISO and used the ArchInstall (call me crazy) script to continue with installation.

I rebooted to see a successful install of Arch on my MacBook, unfortunately, the keyboard and trackpad do not work out of the box. Interestingly enough, the keyboard does work during grub boot.

Using an external mouse and keyboard, I download the [macbook12-spi-driver-dkms](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/macbook12-spi-driver-dkms) driver from AUR.

Upon installing the package from the AUR, I struggle to figure out the next step. After some suffering, I believe *this* is the next step:

    sudo dkms install -m macbook12-spi-driver -v 0+git.315

But unfortunately, I get this error:

    Deprecated feature: CLEAN (/var/lib/dkms/macbook12-spi-driver/0+git.315/source/dkms.conf)
    Sign command: /usr/lib/modules/6.17.9-arch1-1/build/scripts/sign-file

    Consult /var/lib/dkms/macbook12-spi-driver/0+git.315/build/make.log for more information.

Before I tried this command, I edited the mkinitcpio.conf to include the modules mentioned in the github page, but to no avail.

And I am back to feeling like this MacBook may just be a tiny, yet beautiful piece of e-waste after all. I don't plan to give up on this, though!!!",vmpyr_,1pcwiqd,linux_on_mac,03-12-2025,06:06:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_on_mac/comments/1pcwiqd/2015_retina_macbook_12_81_arch_linux/

A Discourse–Semantic State Model (DSS): A Practical State-Transition Framework for How Readers Process Paragraphs,"Hi everyone! I’m a Korean patent attorney, and this idea originally emerged from a very practical problem: **how to give clear, structural feedback** on junior colleagues’ technical and legal writing (especially patent drafts).

While trying to explain *why* certain paragraphs disrupt comprehension or *how* information should unfold, I found myself wanting a more explicit model of how readers update their internal state while reading.

This led me to build a simple state-transition framework I call the **DSS Model (Discourse–Semantic State Model)**. I am *not* presenting this as a scientific theory—I have no academic training in psychology, linguistics, or cognitive science. I’m sharing it here *to ask for pointers*: Is there existing research related to this? Does this resemble known models of text comprehension or discourse representation?

# 1. Core Idea: Paragraphs as State-Transition Functions

Instead of viewing paragraphs as “content blocks,” DSS treats them as **state-transition operations** acting on the reader’s internal model.

Formally:

    D := pn ∘ pn-1 ∘ ... ∘ p1
    STi = (di, si)
    pi : STi-1 → STi
    STn = D(ST0)

Where:

* **di (discourse state)** = active tasks, unresolved questions, expected elaborations, definitions needed
* **si (semantic state)** = tone, interpretive frame, emotional stance, narrative expectation

Each paragraph may:

* introduce a discourse element
* consume (resolve) it
* partially consume it
* transform it into sub-elements
* reactivate forgotten elements
* prune irrelevant items
* shift interpretive stance or tone

The document becomes a chain of deliberate cognitive state transitions.

# 2. Why I Think This Might Be Relevant to Psychology

Even though I developed DSS in a practical context, it feels similar to several cognitive-psychology concepts, such as:

* **situation model updating**
* **discourse representation structures (DRT)**
* **event indexing model**
* **schema activation and slot-filling**
* **expectation-based processing**
* **hierarchical predictive models of reading**

DSS, however, focuses specifically on **paragraph-level functional roles**:

>“What exact change in the reader’s mental state does this paragraph produce?”

This framing has been extremely helpful in evaluating technical writing.

I’m wondering whether psychology has explored something similar but more rigorously.

# 3. Practical Value (Context Where DSS Originated)

# (a) Diagnosing comprehension breakdowns

In technical writing, many problems arise when:

* a paragraph resolves a question never raised,
* introduces new tasks implicitly,
* shifts topics without explicit transition,
* or overloads the reader with multiple competing operations.

A state-transition view makes these breakdowns explicit.

# (b) Understanding cognitive load

If too many discourse elements remain active for too long, readers experience overload or confusion.

DSS implicitly tracks this by monitoring the size/complexity of the discourse state.

# (c) Training novice writers

People often know how to write clear sentences but struggle with **paragraph function**. DSS gives them a simple rule:

>“A paragraph is meaningful when you can describe the change it causes in the reader’s state.”

This reframing alone significantly improves clarity.

# 4. DSS-Lite (Usable Without the Formalism)

A simplified version I use for training:

1. Identify the document’s tasks (what the reader must ultimately understand).
2. Ensure each paragraph performs one primary function:
   * introduce
   * transition
   * elaborate
   * resolve
3. Avoid paragraphs that:
   * do too many things
   * answer questions never asked
   * raise questions never answered

This is surprisingly effective in technical writing and legal drafting.

# 5. What I’m Looking For

I would appreciate any input from cognitive psychologists or discourse researchers:

* Does this resemble existing models?
* Are there formal theories of paragraph-level state transitions?
* What literature should I consult (text comprehension, discourse processing, psycholinguistics)?
* Are there computational models that treat documents this way?

Again, I’m not presenting DSS as a validated theory—just a framework that emerged from practical writing problems. I’m very open to critique, correction, and redirection.

I’m essentially a stay at home mom, but I do work and I do have a career- I just work extremely part-time. (Because I’ve been raising our child.) My partner makes 95% more than I do. They have a very high paying job. I do not have access to significant amounts of cash. I do not understand how I will be able to sign a lease to move out. My income is tiny. We do not have any family in this state and few friends- none I can stay with. 

Can anyone give me a timeline on what to expect? I’m anticipating a very messy divorce. My partner’s go-to is always to control/withhold money. I live in an extremely high cost state and city. Studio and 1 bedroom apartments are 2.5k to 3.5k a month. 

What advice do you think I need to hear? Our lease ends February 10th. It’s coming up so soon. I feel panicked. I won’t tell my partner until January 10th when we have to give a 30 day notice. Welcoming any/all advice. I’ve never been financially dependent on anyone (except in childhood) before these past 4-5 years.

Exploring the Options for Owner Financed Land Near Me,"If you're interested in acquiring land, you might be contemplating seller financing as a method to facilitate your purchase. Seller financing presents numerous advantages, encompassing more adaptable terms and decreased prerequisites for aspects such as credit ratings and initial payments. This can establish itself as a fantastic choice for individuals who might not satisfy the criteria for traditional financing or who wish to avoid engaging with a bank.\
\
Nevertheless, tracking down seller financed land in your vicinity can prove to be quite a challenge. Discovering these types of properties isn't always straightforward, and when you do, it's vital to ensure that you comprehend the stipulations of the financing arrangement. In this article, we'll investigate a selection of the alternatives for seller financed land near you, along with significant considerations to bear in mind.\
\
Grasping Seller Financing\
\
Seller financing, also recognized as seller financing or seller carryback, refers to when the seller of a property provides financing for the buyer. This implies that instead of obtaining a mortgage from a bank, the buyer remits payments directly to the seller. Generally, the buyer will still deliver an initial payment, and the seller will uphold a mortgage on the property. This can prove to be an advantageous arrangement for both parties, empowering the seller to execute a sale in a sluggish market and enabling the buyer to secure financing that may otherwise be unattainable.\
\
One of the primary perks of seller financing is the versatility it presents. The terms of the agreement can be negotiated directly between the buyer and seller and often prove to be more favorable than those offered by a bank. For instance, the interest rate on a seller financed loan might be lower, and the initial payment may be more modest. Additionally, the buyer and seller can concur on a repayment schedule and any other terms they deem mutually beneficial.\
\
One of the fundamental considerations concerning seller financing lies in the associated risk. Given that the seller effectively acts as the bank, they undertake the risk of the buyer defaulting on the loan. Therefore, the seller might necessitate a larger initial payment and levy a higher interest rate. It's crucial for both parties to conscientiously contemplate the terms of the agreement and ensure they are comfortable with the risks and benefits involved.\
\
Locating Seller Financed Land Near You\
\
Now that you have a grasp of the fundamentals of seller financing, let's scrutinize several avenues for identifying seller financed land in your vicinity. A prime starting point for your quest is online. Numerous websites specialize in connecting buyers and sellers of seller financed properties. These platforms frequently enable you to peruse properties by location, price, and other criteria, streamlining the process of discovering land that aligns with your requirements.\
\
You can also reach out to local real estate agents and inquire if they have any listings for seller financed land. Many real estate agents maintain connections with sellers amenable to extending seller financing and may be able to match you with the ideal property. Additionally, real estate auctions can serve as a promising venue for unearthing seller financed land, as numerous sellers aspire to swiftly conclude a sale and might be open to this type of financing arrangement.\
\
Another option involves consulting with local banks and credit unions to ascertain whether they possess any information regarding seller financed properties. While these financial institutions may not directly provide seller financing, they may have ties with sellers amenable to doing so. Moreover, they can furnish valuable insights regarding the local real estate market and the categories of properties available.\
\
Upon identifying potential properties, it's imperative to meticulously review the terms of the seller financing agreement. Ensure you comprehend the interest rate, initial payment, and repayment schedule, and contemplate seeking counsel from a real estate attorney or financial advisor to ensure you're making an informed decision. It's also prudent to commission an appraisal and inspection of the property to verify that you're securing an equitable deal.\
\
Considerations for Seller Financed Land\
\
Regarding seller financed land, several pivotal considerations warrant attention. Firstly and most importantly, scrutinizing the terms of the financing agreement is essential. Ensure that you comprehend the interest rate, initial payment, and repayment schedule, and mull over deliberating the terms with a real estate attorney or financial advisor.\
\
You should also deliberate the risks and benefits of seller financing. While this form of financing can offer increased flexibility and reduced requirements compared to traditional bank financing, it also harbors its own set of risks. For instance, if the seller elects to foreclose on the property, you might forfeit your investment. Ensure that you are at ease with these risks prior to entering into a seller financing agreement.\
\
Another factor to contemplate is the condition of the land. Numerous seller financed properties are vended in an as-is condition, which conveys that you will be accountable for any repairs or maintenance that the property might necessitate. Before finalizing the purchase, it's advisable to subject the land to inspection and appraisal to confirm that you're securing a fair deal.\
\
Lastly, assess the potential for future appreciation. Seller financing can serve as an excellent means to procure a property that might appreciate in value over time. However, it's crucial to conscientiously weigh the market conditions and potential for growth in the area you're contemplating.\
\
In conclusion, seller financed land can prove to be a splendid choice for those aiming to buy land sans the complexity of engaging with a bank. However, pinpointing seller financed land in your vicinity can present a challenge. By diligently weighing your alternatives and comprehending the terms of seller financing, you can identify the perfect property for your requisites. Just ensure that you are at ease with the risks and benefits before consummating your purchase.\

I’ve been tracking how B2B SaaS teams run influencer programs — and the shift is clear: it’s no longer about sponsored posts or influencer clout. The winners are focusing on education, integration, and measurable outcomes.

**What’s changed:**

* **Micro & niche > Macro.** Smaller creators with domain expertise produce higher-intent traffic.
* **Content formats that convert:** Tutorials, walkthroughs, co-hosted webinars, and short-course snippets. These build trust and lower friction in demos.
* **Embed influencers in the product:** Invite them to beta, ask for feedback, co-author release notes — that creates authentic narratives.
* **Better measurement:** AI-assisted attribution links content directly to pipeline stages, so teams can justify spend with revenue impact.

**How to run a campaign (step-by-step):**

1. Define the conversion event (demo booked, trial started, feature used).
2. Build a micro-influencer shortlist by niche relevance and engagement rate (not follower count).
3. Co-create a content plan (series of posts + a webinar + gated resources).
4. Provide product access + briefs that emphasize utility over selling.
5. Track with UTMs, custom events, and an attribution model that credits multi-touch influence.

**Common pitfalls:**

* Paying for vanity metrics (likes) instead of action.
* One-off activations with no follow-up.
* Not providing influencers with product context or support.

For folks running these programs: what metrics are you using to show ROI, and how do you structure long-term partnerships with creators?",its_elev8or_io,1pcwep1,elev8or_io,03-12-2025,05:59:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/elev8or_io/comments/1pcwep1/influencer_marketing_for_saas_in_2025_practical/

I finally have clarity; I want a divorce. I need advice,"I’m starting to have consultation calls with attorneys. What should I ask? How should I prepare? 

I’m essentially a stay at home mom, but I do work and I do have a career- I just work extremely part-time. (Because I’ve been raising our child.) My partner makes 95% more than I do. They have a very high paying job. I do not have access to significant amounts of cash. I do not understand how I will be able to sign a lease to move out. My income is tiny. We do not have any family in this state and few friends- none I can stay with. 

Can anyone give me a timeline on what to expect? I’m anticipating a very messy divorce. My partner’s go-to is always to control/withhold money. I live in an extremely high cost state and city. Studio and 1 bedroom apartments are 2.5k to 3.5k a month. 

What advice do you think I need to hear? Our lease ends February 10th. It’s coming up so soon. I feel panicked. I won’t tell my partner until January 10th when we have to give a 30 day notice.

28M Tokens Later: How I Unfucked My 4B Model with a smart distilled RAG,"I've recently been playing around with making my SLM's more useful and reliable. I'd like to share some of the things I did, so that perhaps it might help someone else in the same boat.

Initially, I had the (obvious, wrong) idea that ""well, shit, I'll just RAG dump Wikipedia and job done"". I trust it's obvious why that's not a great idea (retrieval gets noisy, chunks lack context, model spends more time sifting than answering).

Instead, I thought to myself ""why don't I use the Didactic Method to teach my SLMs what the ground truth is, and then let them argue from there?"". After all, Qwen3-4B is pretty good with its reasoning...it just needs to not start from a position of shit.

The basic work flow -

TLDR

* Use a strong model to write clean, didactic notes from source docs.
* Distill + structure those notes with a local 8B model.
* Load distilled notes into RAG (I love you, Qdrant).
* Use a 4B model with low temp + strict style as the front‑end brain.
* Let it consult RAG both for facts and for “who should answer this?” policy.

**Details**

(1) Create a ""model answer"" --> this involves creating a summary of source material (like say, markdown document explaining launch flags for llama.cpp). You can do this manually or use any capable local model to do it, but for my testing, I fed the source info straight in Gippity 5 with specfic ""make me a good summary of this, hoss"" prompt

Like so: [https://pastebin.com/FaAB2A6f](https://pastebin.com/FaAB2A6f)

(2) Save that output as SUMM-llama-flags.md

(3) Once the summary has been created, use a local ""extractor"" and ""formatter"" model to batch extract high yield information (into JSON) and then convert that into a second distillation (markdown). I used Qwen3-8b for this.

Extract prompt [https://pastebin.com/nT3cNWW1](https://pastebin.com/nT3cNWW1)

Format prompt (run directly on that content after model has finished its extraction) [https://pastebin.com/PNLePhW8](https://pastebin.com/PNLePhW8)

(4) Save *that* as DISTILL-llama-flags.md.

(5) Drop Temperature low (0.3) and made Qwen3-4B cut the cutsey imagination shit (top\_p = 0.9, top\_k=0), not that it did a lot of that to begin with.

(6) Import DISTILL-llama-flags.md into your RAG solution (god I love markdown).

Once I had *that* in place, I also created some ""fence around the law"" (to quote Judaism) guard-rails and threw *them* into RAG. This is my question meta, that I can append to the front (or back) of any query. Basically, I can ask the SLM ""based on escalation policy and the complexity of what I'm asking you, who should answer this question? You or someone else? Explain why.""

[https://pastebin.com/rDj15gkR](https://pastebin.com/rDj15gkR)

(I also created another ""how much will this cost me to answer with X on Open Router"" calculator, a ""this is my rig"" ground truth document etc but those are sort of bespoke for my use-case and may not be generalisable. You get the idea though; you can create a bunch of IF-THEN rules).

The TL:DR of all this -

With a GOOD initial summary (and distillation) you can make a VERY capable little brain, that will argue quite well from first principles. Be aware, this can be a lossy pipeline...so make sure you don't GIGO yourself into stupid. IOW, trust but verify and keep both the source material AND SUMM-file.md until you're confident with the pipeline. (And of course, re-verify anything critical as needed).

I tested, and retested, and re-retest a lot (literally 28 million tokens on OR to make triple sure), doing a bunch of adversarial Q&A testing, side by side with GPT5, to triple check that this worked as I hoped it would.

The results basically showed a 9/10 for direct recall of facts, 7-8/10 for ""argue based on my knowledge stack"" or ""extrapolate based on knowledge stack + reference to X website"" and about 6/10 on ""based on knowledge, give me your best guess about X adjacent topic"". That's a LOT better than just YOLOing random shit into Qdrant...and orders of magnitude better than relying on pre-trained data.

Additionally, I made this this cute little system prompt to give me some fake confidence -

`Tone: neutral, precise, low-context.`

`Rules:`

* `Answer first. No preamble. ≤3 short paragraphs.`
* `Minimal emotion or politeness; no soft closure.`
* `Never generate personal memories, subjective experiences, or fictional biographical details.`
* `Emotional or expressive tone is forbidden.`
* `Cite your sources`
* `End with a declarative sentence.`

`Append: ""Confidence: [percent] | Source: [Pretrained | Deductive | User | External]"".`

^ model reported, not a real statistical analysis. Not really needed for Qwen model, but you know, cute.

The nice thing here is, as your curated RAG pile grows, so does your expert system’s ""smarts"", because it has more ground truth to reason from. Plus, .md files are tiny, easy to demarcate, highlight important stuff (enforce semantic chunking) etc.

**The next step:** 

Build up the RAG corpus and automate steps 1-6 with a small python script, so I don't need to baby sit it. Then it basically becomes ""drop source info into folder, hit START, let'er rip"" (or even lazier, set up a Task Scheduler to monitor the folder and then run ""Amazing-python-code-for-awesomeness.py"" at X time).

Also, create separate knowledge buckets. OWUI (probably everything else) let's you have separate ""containers"" - right now within my RAG DB I have ""General"", ""Computer"" etc - so I can add whichever container I want to a question, ad hoc, query the whole thing, or zoom down to a specific document level (like my DISTILL-llama.cpp.md)

I hope this helps someone! I'm just noob but I'm happy to answer whatever questions I can (up to but excluding the reasons my near-erotic love for .md files and notepad++. A man needs to keep some mystery).",Impossible-Power6989,1pcwafx,LocalLLM,03-12-2025,05:53:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLM/comments/1pcwafx/28m_tokens_later_how_i_unfucked_my_4b_model_with/
2 Chronicles 17,"Jehoshaphat King of Judah
17 Jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king and strengthened himself against Israel. 2 He stationed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah and put garrisons in Judah and in the towns of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.

3 The Lord was with Jehoshaphat because he followed the ways of his father David before him. He did not consult the Baals 4 but sought the God of his father and followed his commands rather than the practices of Israel. 5 The Lord established the kingdom under his control; and all Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat, so that he had great wealth and honor. 6 His heart was devoted to the ways of the Lord; furthermore, he removed the high places and the Asherah poles from Judah.

7 In the third year of his reign he sent his officials Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel and Micaiah to teach in the towns of Judah. 8 With them were certain Levites—Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah and Tob-Adonijah—and the priests Elishama and Jehoram. 9 They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the Book of the Law of the Lord; they went around to all the towns of Judah and taught the people.

10 The fear of the Lord fell on all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding Judah, so that they did not go to war against Jehoshaphat. 11 Some Philistines brought Jehoshaphat gifts and silver as tribute, and the Arabs brought him flocks: seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred goats.

12 Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful; he built forts and store cities in Judah 13 and had large supplies in the towns of Judah. He also kept experienced fighting men in Jerusalem. 14 Their enrollment by families was as follows:

From Judah, commanders of units of 1,000:

Adnah the commander, with 300,000 fighting men;

15 next, Jehohanan the commander, with 280,000;

16 next, Amasiah son of Zikri, who volunteered himself for the service of the Lord, with 200,000.

17 From Benjamin:

Eliada, a valiant soldier, with 200,000 men armed with bows and shields;

18 next, Jehozabad, with 180,000 men armed for battle.

19 These were the men who served the king, besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.",Ok-Purple-1151,1pcw8zq,Bibleverses7,03-12-2025,05:51:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bibleverses7/comments/1pcw8zq/2_chronicles_17/

Real Estate Investing 101: Everything New Investors Need to Know Before Their First Deal,"***By Ebonie Beaco, Mortgage Loan Originator, Real Estate Investor & Business Consultant (NMLS 2389954)***  
***Empowering Homeowners. Financing Investors.***

https://preview.redd.it/djhc63rvgx4g1.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bc5b7463d403f49c228770ee34947d47ad76daa

Before diving into your first real estate investment, it helps to understand what the journey actually looks like. Consider this simple example: A new investor finds a duplex listed for $295,000 in a strong rental neighborhood. On the surface, the numbers look great—each unit rents for $1,450, and the property appears well-maintained. Excited, they run rough numbers in their head and rush to put in an offer… only to later discover that property taxes were underestimated, the roof needs replacing within a year, and their financing wasn’t structured for the best long-term cash flow. What seemed like a solid deal quickly becomes a stressful one simply because the investor moved faster than their knowledge.

Now consider another investor evaluating that same duplex—but this time, they run a full cash-flow analysis, obtain a detailed inspection report, review neighborhood rental demand, compare multiple loan programs, and consult with a lender who specializes in investment financing. They use real numbers, real data, and real expertise to guide their decision. This investor knows what they’re getting into before signing the contract. Same property. Same price. Two dramatically different outcomes—all based on preparation.

These examples illustrate why understanding the fundamentals before buying is essential. Your first deal can set the tone for your entire investing journey. Whether your goal is passive income, equity growth, long-term wealth, or financial freedom, the right education and guidance make all the difference.



# 1. Understand Your Investment Strategy Before You Buy

Real estate investing is not “one size fits all.” Each strategy has different timelines, risk levels, financing requirements, and expected returns.

# Common strategies new investors consider:

# Buy & Hold (Long-Term Rentals)

* Consistent monthly cash flow
* Long-term appreciation
* Tax benefits
* Less risk compared to flips

# Fix & Flip

* Buying discounted properties
* Renovating for resale
* Faster, larger profits
* Requires good contractor management

# BRRRR Strategy

Buy → Rehab → Rent → Refinance → Repeat

* Builds long-term wealth
* Recaptures capital to reinvest
* Perfect for scaling

# House Hacking

* Live in one unit, rent the others
* Low down payment options
* Great for new investors

# Short-Term Rentals / Airbnb

* High income potential
* Higher management requirements
* Market-specific regulations

# TIP:

Pick **one strategy** to start. Don’t try to master everything. Your first deal should be simple, strategic, and manageable.



# 2. Know the Numbers Before Making an Offer

Successful investors buy based on numbers—not emotions. Before your first deal, you must understand how to evaluate a property’s financial performance.

# Key metrics every investor must understand:

**Cash Flow**  
Net income after all expenses are paid each month.

**Cap Rate**  
(Annual Net Operating Income ÷ Purchase Price)  
Shows the rate of return based on the property itself.

**Cash-on-Cash Return**  
Net annual cash flow ÷ total cash invested.  
Used to compare deals and evaluate performance.

**DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)**  
Rental income ÷ mortgage payment.  
Used for DSCR investor loans.

**Rehab Budget**  
Accurate renovation estimates prevent financial surprises.

**TIP:**  
Use deal calculators—Don’t guess. Programs like DealCheck, BiggerPockets, or a DSCR calculator make this easier.



# 3. Get Your Financing Strategy in Order Early

Your lender is one of the most valuable partners in your investing journey. Many deals fall apart because buyers wait too long to secure financing. Getting pre-approved early strengthens your offers and helps you understand what you *can* and *cannot* afford.

# Common loan types for new investors:

# Conventional Investment Loans

* 15%–25% down
* Best rates for strong borrowers

# FHA (for House Hackers)

* 3.5% down
* Live in one unit, rent the others

# DSCR Loans

* Approval based on rental income, not personal income
* Great for self-employed investors

# Bank Statement Loans

* Ideal for entrepreneurs
* Uses business deposits instead of tax returns

# Fix & Flip / Renovation Loans

* Includes rehab cost
* Faster closing times

# TIP:

Work with a **mortgage broker who specializes in real estate investors**—someone who understands DSCR, BRRRR refinancing, portfolio loans, and the unique needs of investors.



# 4. Learn to Analyze Neighborhoods—Not Just Houses

The neighborhood matters as much as the property. Rental demand, crime rates, school districts, job growth, population trends, and local amenities all affect your returns.

# Neighborhood analysis tools:

* PropStream
* Redfin Data Center
* Zillow Research
* NeighborhoodScout
* Mashvisor (Airbnb analysis)

# Look for neighborhoods with:

* Strong rental demand
* Low vacancy rates
* Increasing property values
* Access to transportation or jobs
* Low or stable crime levels
* Active renovation or development

# TIP:

Don’t chase the cheapest areas—chase areas with **consistent demand**.



# 5. Build the Right Real Estate Team

A strong team protects you from costly mistakes and helps you navigate your first deal confidently.

# Essential team members include:

* **Investor-friendly real estate agent**
* **Mortgage broker** (experienced with investor loans)
* **Property inspector**
* **Contractor or handyman**
* **Insurance agent**
* **Property manager** (if not self-managing)
* **Title company / attorney** (depending on the state)

# TIP:

Always get **at least three contractor bids**. Compare price, timeline, and materials used.



# 6. Don’t Skip the Inspection—Ever

Even experienced investors never skip inspections. What you don’t know can cost you money.

# An inspection identifies issues in:

* Roofing
* Electrical
* Plumbing
* Foundation and structural
* HVAC systems
* Mold, leaks, water damage

# TIP:

Use the inspection report to negotiate credits or repairs—and protect your budget.



# 7. Understand Landlord Responsibilities Before Becoming One

Being a landlord isn’t just collecting rent. It’s compliance, communication, and management.

# Landlords must know:

* Local landlord-tenant laws
* Security deposit rules
* Proper notice timelines
* Fair housing regulations
* Eviction processes
* Lease requirements

# TIP:

Use property management software like Buildium, Avail, RentRedi, or AppFolio to stay organized.



# 8. Run the Property Like a Business

Treating your first investment like a hobby will cost you money. Systems and documentation matter.

# Operate with:

* A separate bank account
* Accounting and bookkeeping tools
* Written leases
* Maintenance logs
* An emergency repair fund (3–5 months of expenses)

# TIP:

Create written procedures for repairs, tenant communication, and rent collection—even if you’re self-managing.



# 9. Buy Conservatively—Don’t Stretch to Make a Deal Work

A deal that only works under “perfect conditions” is not a deal. Real estate investing requires conservative numbers and margin for error.

# Avoid deals that depend on:

* Unrealistic rent increases
* Perfect tenants
* Over-optimistic rehab timelines
* Underestimated expenses
* Hoping the market saves you

# TIP:

Your first property should feel **safe**, not stressful.



# 10. Start Small, Learn, Then Scale

Your first deal is about learning. Your second deal is about improvement. Your third deal is where momentum begins.

# Smart ways to start:

* Duplex or triplex (house hack)
* Affordable single-family rental
* Cosmetic flip with minimal structural work
* A BRRRR project with clear comps and proven rental demand

# TIP:

The goal isn’t perfection—it’s progress, education, and long-term wealth building.



# Final Thoughts: You Don’t Need to Do This Alone

Real estate investing is one of the greatest vehicles for financial independence, but your success depends on preparation, guidance, and the right partnerships. With the right lender, team, and strategy, you’ll be positioned to make confident decisions and build a portfolio that supports your long-term goals.

As a mortgage loan originator, real estate investor, and business consultant with over 25 years in the industry, my mission is to help new investors take their first step with clarity and confidence.

need psychiatrist suggestions,"I’ve been experiencing long-term difficulty with attention, task initiation, and mental consistency. As a child, I was very hyperactive and restless, but over time that energy moved inward and evolved into inattentiveness, strong procrastination, and executive dysfunction. I struggle to start tasks even when I want to, and my motivation fluctuates unpredictably. I often hyperfocus intensely on things that interest me but can’t sustain focus on routine or repetitive tasks. Mentally I get fatigued easily, and I tend to be emotionally sensitive and affected strongly by pressure or criticism. These patterns have been present for years, not just recently, and I want to understand whether this is ADHD-inattentive type or another attentional or cognitive pattern affecting my functioning

Now Im looking for a psychiatrist who does online consultations...preferably someone who actually listens and doesn’t just throw meds at you in 5 minutes. If you’ve personally had a good experience with someone, please drop their name. Would really appreciate the help

TL;DR: Lifelong attention + task initiation issues, childhood hyperactivity shifting into adult inattentiveness and procrastination. Looking for a psychiatrist who actually listens and offers proper evaluation, not rushed medication.",holymolyraves,1pcw3b8,ADHD,03-12-2025,05:42:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1pcw3b8/need_psychiatrist_suggestions/
Submit To Me or F$#@ Off!,"u/itsmikesandoval made a post a while back looking for [this conversation](https://vedabase.io/en/library/transcripts/750626r1la/). He eventually found it himself. It is eighteen minutes long and worth the listen.

This discussion is notorious in ISKCON. As a devotee I heard the questioners were envious demons. Prabhupada kicked one of them out of the movement. He dared challenge Prabhupada to his face and suffered tragic reaction: he was cursed by Krishna and fell away into a hellish existence. I think he was labelled a snake.

Like almost everything you hear in ISKCON, this is far from the truth.

The questioners were looking for a resolution to important issues they had with the movement. They maintained a sincere respectful demeanor, however; they would not be silenced, intimidated or derailed, neither by Prabhupada nor their senior godbrothers (one of whom they basically told to shut up).

They were concerned about absurd statements in the Puranas. For example, that Ugrasena (Krishna's maternal grandfather) had four billion servants. This is simply impossible. Devotees may accept this on faith but the rest of the world will not. Perhaps they wanted Prabhupada to relax his literalism and allow for some stories to be interpreted poetically or allegorically.

They were concerned about the system of absolute authority. Whatever Prabhupada says becomes law within ISKCON. This power was then extended to his leading disciples. One of Prabhupada's sanyassi disciples had sexually propositioned the questioner. This same leader had used his supposed divine status to manipulate a new bhakta into sex. The questioner feels people should be able to question authority within the movement.

They want to know if Prabhupada was omnipotent. He knows the absolute truth but does he know relative truths as well? Does he know everything that is happening in the world? If so, do his disciples have this same power? Can their rulings on relative truths be questioned?

These are all important questions. How do we apply rationality to the interpretation of scripture? How do we draw boundaries in the use of power?

It seems to me that out of concern for the movement they wanted Prabhupada to restrain the power of the leadership hierarchy. They saw it being abused. They wanted devotees to use their brains and not be blind followers. What they didn't know is blind followers are exactly what Prabhupada wants.

Prabhupada responded by shaming them and accusing them of not following the regulative principles. ""Who are you to ask such questions? You are not even following the principles"". They explain that they are following them.

Prabhupada shifts gears to attacking their appearance. They had grown their hair out. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu would not even look at their faces. All disciples must shave their heads. **Then Prabhupada rejected them as disciples.**

This is something I have noticed in ISKCON. The so-called intimate relationship with the guru, and with leaders in general, is dependent on total submission. If one particle of autonomy is shown, the disciple is rejected.

The questioners explain that even when their heads were shaved they could not ask such questions. Following every demand does not grant the right to think for yourself. Rather the same restraints are in place. They  also approached respectfully, as a disciple should, so why are they being attacked?

They point out that Prabhupada himself had hair and a mustache. This picture is in the Bhagavatam. No doubt they had used this argument against critical godbrothers.

Prabhupada became offended and no longer wanted to speak with them. He tells them to ask their questions to his leading disciples or to read his books. He delegates these troublesome questioners to them. He doesn't have time for such rebellious so-called disciples. He only speaks when people are submitting to him without question.

Prabhupada is honest about his level of knowledge. He only knows what his religious texts say. He will not speculate outside of that or give his own opinion. This is seen as integrity within ISKCON. Really it is fundamentalism.

He does not know anything outside of the scriptures to be true. He is only confident in them. In contrast, when he stays within the lines of scripture, he is divinely empowered.

If his disciples repeat that same messaging without adding or subtracting, they are also empowered, not only in teaching what those texts say, but like Prabhupada, in decision making, in dealing with the world, and in managing the movement.

Within this hierarchy of empowerment, the only way to understand things is through total submission with blind faith, even in contradiction to reason. Those who do not totally submit to Prabhupada and his representatives are unable to enter into the mystery. The rebellious are rejected as insincere, morally lapsed and unqualified. Only though apology and submission can they become qualified again.

Reason is not a qualification, only surrender to authority. The sanyassi who asked the questioner for sex is an example. He is defended as sincere because he apologized for his mistake and continues to submit.

One of the questioners did leave ISKCON. Far from becoming a karmi mudha destined for hell for angering the pure devotee, he became an astrologer, consultant, and inspirational speaker while successfully working in the tech industry. [Assuming this is him](https://jeffreyarmstrong.com/). The guy was smart enough to sniff out the core problems of the movement.

Interestingly, had Prabhupada answered these questions patiently, he could have saved the movement much trouble. These issues were central to the shake up after Prabhuapada left, during the Zonal Acharya period, when ISKCON almost collapsed.",Solomon_Kane_1928,1pcw34t,exHareKrishna,03-12-2025,05:42:13,https://i.redd.it/8dpoovay8x4g1.png

4. **Results:** You’ll walk out with a noticeably brighter, healthier-looking smile—often several shades lighter than before.

The entire experience typically takes under an hour, leaving you with instant results and renewed confidence.

**Keeping That Glow Alive**

After your whitening treatment, maintaining that brilliance is easy with a few mindful habits. Limit dark beverages like coffee, tea, and wine, rinse your mouth after meals, and stick to your dentist’s recommended touch-up routine. Regular cleanings and dental checkups will also help preserve that pearly shine.

And if you ever notice your smile starting to fade, Dr. Phil’s office offers touch-up sessions designed to keep your teeth radiant all year round.

Can SI Joint Cause Hip Pain?,"The Connection Between SI Joint Dysfunction and Hip Pain: Understanding the Causes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Did you know that the sacroiliac (SI) joint plays a crucial role in your body’s movement and stability? Many people struggle with unexplained hip pain, and the source might be related to SI joint dysfunction. Understanding how these two issues are connected can help you identify the source of your discomfort and seek the right treatment.

The SI joint connects your lower spine to your pelvis. It is located on both sides of your back and is responsible for transferring weight and forces between your upper body and legs. While the SI joint is designed for stability, it can be affected by injuries, arthritis, or other factors, leading to pain in the surrounding areas, including the hip.

When the SI joint is not functioning properly, it can result in a range of symptoms. Here are a few key signs that may indicate SI joint dysfunction:

- Localized pain in the lower back, often on one side.
- Pain that radiates into the hip, buttock, or down the leg.
- Discomfort when sitting or standing for prolonged periods.
- Easing of pain with certain movements, like bending or twisting.
- Worsening pain after certain physical activities.

So, how does dysfunction in the SI joint lead to hip pain? It’s primarily due to the way the body compensates for the joint’s instability. When the SI joint is misaligned or overly mobile, the body tries to adjust. This adjustment can strain the surrounding muscles and ligaments, resulting in referred pain known as somatic pain. As a result, you might feel discomfort not just in the lower back but in the hip as well.

In some cases, hip pain can also arise from inflammation in the SI joint. Conditions like SI arthritis can cause swelling and pain that radiates to the hip, making it difficult to walk or engage in daily activities. You might find that certain movements, such as climbing stairs or crossing your legs, exacerbate your discomfort.

There are several factors that can contribute to SI joint dysfunction, leading to hip pain:

- **Injury:** A fall or a direct impact can disrupt the normal function of the SI joint.
- **Pregnancy:** Hormonal changes and added weight can increase stress on the SI joint, causing pain.
- **Arthritis:** Conditions like osteoarthritis can affect the integrity of the joint.
- **Leg Length Discrepancy:** Unequal leg lengths can result in improper alignment of the SI joint.
- **Poor Posture:** Slouching can place excessive strain on the SI joint, leading to dysfunction.

If you suspect that your hip pain may be related to SI joint dysfunction, it’s essential to seek a proper diagnosis from a healthcare professional. They may recommend physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the joint, improve flexibility, and enhance overall mobility. Specific exercises can target both the SI joint and hip to alleviate pain.

In some cases, healthcare providers may also recommend treatments such as:

- **Medications:** Over-the-counter pain relievers can help manage inflammation and discomfort.
- **Injections:** Corticosteroid injections may reduce inflammation within the joint.
- **Manual Therapy:** Chiropractors or physical therapists can perform adjustments to realign the joint.
- **Supportive Devices:** A SI joint belt might help stabilize the area and reduce pain during activities.

Understanding the connection between SI joint dysfunction and hip pain is crucial for finding relief. By addressing the underlying issues and working closely with healthcare professionals, you can regain mobility and improve your quality of life. Remember, you don’t have to live with pain, and taking action is the first step toward recovery.

Effective Treatments for Hip Pain Linked to SI Joint Issues
-----------------------------------------------------------

Experiencing hip pain can be a frustrating ordeal, especially when the cause is not straightforward. One often overlooked source of hip discomfort is the sacroiliac (SI) joint. Located at the base of your spine, the SI joint connects the sacrum to the pelvic bones. When this joint is irritated or inflamed, it can lead to pain that radiates to your hip. Understanding effective treatments for hip pain linked to SI joint issues can help you regain your mobility and improve your quality of life.

### Understanding the Connection Between SI Joint and Hip Pain

To address your hip pain, it’s essential to understand how the SI joint can contribute to your symptoms. The SI joint plays a crucial role in transferring weight and forces between your upper body and legs. If the joint becomes inflamed due to injury, arthritis, or other conditions, it may lead to referred pain in the hip area. Often, individuals may attribute their discomfort solely to the hip itself, overlooking the possibility that the root cause lies within the SI joint.

### Non-Surgical Treatments

Many non-surgical treatments have proven effective for alleviating hip pain related to SI joint dysfunction. Here are some popular options:

- **Physical Therapy:** Engaging with a physical therapist can help you strengthen your muscles and improve flexibility. Specific exercises can target the SI joint, helping to stabilize it and reduce pain.
- **Chiropractic Care:** A chiropractor can perform adjustments to realign the SI joint, potentially alleviating misalignments that cause pain. Spinal manipulations may also offer relief.
- **Medication:** Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can help manage pain and inflammation. For severe cases, a doctor may prescribe stronger medications or corticosteroid injections.
- **Ice and Heat Therapy:** Applying ice packs can reduce inflammation, while heat packs can relieve muscle tension. Alternating between the two can provide significant comfort.

### Alternative Therapies

If traditional treatments aren’t effective, you might consider alternative therapies. These approaches can complement your treatment plan and enhance your healing process:

- **Acupuncture:** This ancient technique involves inserting thin needles into various points on the body. It may help relieve pain and promote circulation in the hip and SI joint areas.
- **Massage Therapy:** Therapeutic massage can reduce muscle tightness around the SI joint, improving overall mobility and comfort.
- **Yoga and Stretching:** Gentle yoga can be effective in stretching tight muscles and improving overall function. Specific poses may help relieve pressure on the SI joint.

### Surgical Treatments

In more severe cases where pain persists despite other treatments, surgical options may be considered. These can include:

-Need relief from Joint Pain?- Get Free Ebook Here--&gt;https://www.jointpainrelief.co.uk   
- **SI Joint Fusion:** This procedure aims to stabilize the SI joint by fusing it to the pelvic bone. It’s generally recommended when conservative treatments fail to provide relief.
- **Other Surgical Interventions:** Depending on the underlying issue, other surgical approaches could be an option. Always consult a qualified orthopedic specialist to discuss these alternatives.

### Self-Care Practices

In addition to professional treatments, there are self-care practices you can adopt for effective pain management:

- **Maintain a Healthy Weight:** Extra weight can place additional stress on your joints. Managing your weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise can relieve pressure on the SI joint.
- **Modify Activity Levels:** Pay attention to your body's signals. If certain activities exacerbate your hip pain, it may be worth modifying or avoiding them temporarily.
- **Increase Core Strength:** Strengthening your core muscles provides better support to the SI joint. Consider exercises that target core stability, like planks and abdominal workouts.

Managing hip pain linked to SI joint issues requires a multifaceted approach. By understanding the connection between these areas and exploring various treatment options, you can take significant steps toward recovery. Always consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best plan tailored to your situation. Your path to pain-free movement is within reach, and proactive management is key to achieving your health goals.

### Conclusion

Understanding the connection between the sacroiliac (SI) joint and hip pain is crucial for those experiencing discomfort in this area. It’s essential to recognize that SI joint dysfunction can often be a primary driver of hip pain, as the body's musculoskeletal system functions as a network where one issue can lead to another. The pain may stem from inflammation, injury, or muscle imbalances that arise when the SI joint doesn't work correctly. By identifying the underlying causes of your discomfort, you can take steps that directly impact your quality of life.

In terms of treatment, there is a variety of effective options available. Physical therapy is often a first step, helping to strengthen the surrounding muscles and improve flexibility. Manual therapies like chiropractic adjustments may also provide relief by restoring proper alignment. Additionally, pain management techniques, from medication to injections, help alleviate symptoms, allowing for better movement and function. You might also explore lifestyle changes, such as improving your posture and incorporating low-impact exercises that support joint health.

Ultimately, recognizing how SI joint dysfunction can lead to hip pain allows for targeted treatment strategies that address the root of the problem. By seeking the right interventions and investing in proper care, you can effectively manage your discomfort and enhance your overall well-being. Stay proactive, listen to your body, and don’t hesitate to consult a healthcare professional for guidance tailored to your specific needs.

Seeking Advice from y’all,"Guys, I need your immediate, collective wisdom on a **crisis situation** a close friend is navigating. I’ve exhausted my own advice, and she’s terrified of making the wrong move.

My friend, let's call her **Stacey**, works at a consulting firm and has been there for about 8 months. She’s brilliant, dedicated, and relies heavily on this job, which is why she gets in early every day—she has a long commute. Everything was fine until recently, when her boss, **Mike**, started acting deeply inappropriate.

It started subtly: random, non-work-related texts from Mike after hours. Stacey brushed them off, thinking he was just a clumsy boss.

But the situation exploded a few days ago. Stacey was submitting a report to Mike, and he brought up something he’d said way back when she was new. He’d helped her with a process and half-jokingly said she owed him a beer. Stacey never thought twice about it.

Now, Mike looked her dead in the eye and said: **“Since you failed to buy me that beer, I’m going to take you out instead.”**

He didn't wait for a response. He immediately started setting times and places, pressuring her to meet outside of work.

Stacey heard from some of the other women at the office that Mike has a **known pattern of doing this**. He tries to lure them into dates, and while they all told him no, they confirmed the constant, smothering pressure is real.

Stacey knows that if she says yes, Mike gains **total leverage** over her. We all know how that story ends: it would destroy her professional standing and put her in a morally compromising position.

This is the part where I need your help: Stacey needs to shut this down, but she cannot afford to lose her job. Mike is the one with the power. A firm, confrontational ""No"" could easily lead to retaliation—a bad performance review, being sidelined, or outright termination.

**How does Stacey professionally and permanently decline Mike’s insistence and pressure for an ""outing"" while maintaining a strictly professional boundary that protects her job?**

**What is the perfect, professional script or strategy to deploy right now?** Please share any advice you have for shutting down this form of workplace harassment without giving the aggressor a clear reason to fire her. 🙏🏽",Veryinsaneactually,1pcvw6k,Rwanda,03-12-2025,05:31:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rwanda/comments/1pcvw6k/seeking_advice_from_yall/

Recommendation for an EPA Attorney?,"
My neighbor / landlord ran a dry cleaner for many years. Dry cleaner has been closed for 15+ years. Something fishy is going on and the city is asking him to take water / air / soil samples… in my yard too.

Before I go down that path, I’m looking to consult an EPA attorney to understand any liability implications I may have in addition to any legal recourse I may have if the sample comes back elevated. 

Looking for both an EPA attorney and a consultant, preferably on the westside. Any recs?

OFF SIM,"Hello, mga ka-OP! 33F here, i have multiple of OLA's dahil sa tapal system and this is my dead end, I needed to stop. Been OD sa mga illegal OLA's ko for 6D. I tried to communicate with them at first but as usual di sila nakikinig kasi they're illegal OLA's. Been receiving death threats and harassment everyday. Nung una ayoko mag-off sim maybe due to guilt and the fact na may utang ako. So, I decided to report them from PNP anti-cyber crime, sabi ng police if hinaharass kayo and sending death threats na do not pay them. Hindi pa ako nakuntento, I even went to the NBI anti cyber crime law to report and same thing ang sinabi nila saken and recommended me to go to PAOCC camp crame, pumunta din po ako and they said the same thing. Hindi po nila tayo makakasuhan, dahil hindi po nila kaya magpakilala ag magbigay ng address! at if ever man pabor po sa atin iyon. Ngayon ko lang napagdesisyunan na mag off sim na at magpalit ng number. So far, mas payapa ako kasi walang negative things na pumapasok sa isip ko. Madami ako nababasa na nagpopost sa social media, ito talaga pinaka kinakatakot ko at sobrang nag ooverthink ako about dito, pero naisip ko ayoko na i-stress sarili ko sa mga bagay na di ko control. Kung ano man gawin nila so be it, naka-focus nalang po ako ngayon sa daily life ko, ayoko makulong sa mga bagay na di ko control kaya mahalaga po ang mga taong nasa paligid nyo at naniniwala sainyo, dun lang po kayo mag-focus! DO NOT PAY THOSE ILLEGAL OLA's! Ngayon po para sa peace of mind ko nagpaschedule na din po ako ng consultation sa lawyer mamaya. 

Wag po kayo matakot yan po ang sisira at kakain sa isip nyo. 

Sharing this po as a comfort sa mga patuloy na lumalaban at hinaharass! 

Tandaan nyo po, THERE IS MORE TO LIFE THAN THESE ILLEGAL OLA's. Wag magpaka stress at maging matatag po tayong lahat.

Yes, kasalanan po natin ang mga bad decision in life but it doesn't mean di na tayo pwede magmove forward. STOP LIVING IN SHADOW. Mamuhay tayo ng tulad ng dati.

Pricing strategy for sale,"I'm trying to list my property in market in New year. Location Letchworth Garden City. It's a 39year old 2 bed flat with 111years on lease left. Ground rent £100pa (doubles every 25years) and service charge £1280 annually. Since It's a purpose built from 80s it has a very large living room (34sqm) and a separate kitchen. It's a top floor flat with large size loft for storage. There is a dedicated parking at the front of property and a large recreation ground next to property. The interiors of flats are fairly modern but no recent upgrades. I have upgraded windows to double glazing(2021) and new floorings(5years back). Similar flat was sold in 2023 for £225k it was rear side of my block.

I'm now trying to work out pricing strategy. I have spoken to 4 agents so far 3 of them are of the opinion, market at £230k which is a fair comparable price and will attract buyers. 4th agent is bit unconventional suggesting to market with Guide price strategy by setting £220k-£230k range. Get maximum interest and then negotiate upwards to get £225k plus. He charges more(1.5%+VAT) compared to all others in market but has personalized approach and I feel he is a strong negotiator. He isn't there just for marketing he is like a consultant navigating the sale till completion. I did not find such drive in other agents who were there just for marketing and leaving rest of sale process with the young agents at their office. I'm not so sure about his strategy hence the confusion.

I had listed this property last year for £230k and got an offer of £228k within a day. After prolonged delay from buyer side in arranging funds(from his transfer of equity) he withdrew.

Considering flat market not being great in recent times do you think this guide price strategy will work? Or is counter productive? I'm unable to decide.",DirectorExcellent342,1pcvrum,HousingUK,03-12-2025,05:25:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1pcvrum/pricing_strategy_for_sale/

Tulum has quickly become one of the most desirable destinations for travelers seeking wellness, relaxation, and aesthetic enhancement. Along with its pristine beaches and ancient Mayan ruins, Tulum is now a hotspot for cosmetic treatments, especially **Botox**. If you’re looking to refresh your look while experiencing a luxurious tropical escape, a [Medical Spa Tulum Botox](https://botoxtulum.clinic/appointment/) experience is the perfect blend of beauty and vacation.

In this complete guide, we’ll explore why Tulum is emerging as the ultimate beauty tourism destination, how Botox works, what benefits you can expect, treatment options, safety considerations, and how to book your session with the best medical specialists in Tulum.



# 🌟 Why Choose Medical Spa Tulum Botox?

Tulum is known for its serene wellness retreats and high-quality medical spas that merge holistic wellness with cutting-edge cosmetic treatments. When you combine medical excellence with a calming environment, the results are elevated—both physically and mentally.

# Key Reasons People Prefer Botox in Tulum

* 🌴 **Vacation + Self-Care Combo**: Restore youthful radiance while relaxing near turquoise oceans.

* 🎯 **Skilled Aesthetic Experts**: Certified aesthetic practitioners ensure precision and safety.

Tulum offers the ideal space to reset, rejuvenate, and return home looking refreshed and youthful.



# 💉 Understanding Botox: How It Works

Botox (Botulinum Toxin Type A) is a neuromodulator used to relax facial muscles responsible for dynamic wrinkles. When injected with professional skill, the results appear natural—not frozen.

# Botox Treats:

✔ Forehead lines  
✔ Frown lines (11s between eyebrows)  
✔ Crow’s feet around the eyes  
✔ Bunny lines on the nose  
✔ Brow lift for youthful eyes  
✔ Smile line softening  
✔ Masseter reduction for jawline slimming  
✔ Chin dimpling and neck band smoothing

The full effects typically appear within **3–7 days** and last **3–5 months**, depending on body metabolism and lifestyle.



# ✨ Benefits of Choosing Botox at a Medical Spa in Tulum

Botox is not just a cosmetic treatment—it’s a confidence booster. Here’s what people love about it:

* **Quick & Comfortable**: Most treatments take under 20 minutes.
* **Non-Surgical**: No downtime required—enjoy the beach right after.
* **Subtle Enhancement**: Keeps your natural expressions intact.
* **Youthful Glow**: Smooth, lifted skin enhances your vacation photos.
* **Preventive Aging**: Slows wrinkle formation for long-term benefits.

You walk out looking refreshed, not altered.



# 🌺 A Complete Wellness Experience in Tulum

A **Medical Spa Tulum Botox** session is more than a procedure—it’s a lifestyle treat. Many spas combine Botox with complementary therapies such as:

* Hydrating facials
* Skin rejuvenation treatments
* LED light therapy
* IV drips for detox and energy
* Personalized skincare programs
* Mind-body healing sessions

The combination ensures maximum beauty enhancement with deep relaxation.



# 🧖 What to Expect During Your Botox Appointment

If you’ve never tried Botox before, here’s how a typical appointment in Tulum unfolds:

# 🩺 Step-by-Step Process

1. **Consultation**: Discuss concerns, goals, and medical history.
2. **Facial Analysis**: Practitioner maps areas for precise micro-injections.
3. **Numbing Option**: Topical cream if desired for full comfort.
4. **Injection Procedure**: Quick, accurate injections with ultra-thin needles.
5. **Aftercare Guidance**: Easy post-treatment instructions.

# 💡 Immediate Tips

* Avoid rubbing the injected area for 24 hours
* Skip intense workouts and saunas for one day
* No direct sun exposure on treated zones initially

Your practitioner ensures a seamless and enjoyable experience.



# 🌞 Botox & Beauty Tourism in Tulum

Tulum has become an iconic destination for beauty treatments due to:

* Growth in boutique medical spas
* Highly trained aesthetic teams
* Travelers combining vacation + rejuvenation
* The rising global focus on natural beauty

**Medical tourism** lets you enjoy pampering while saving time and money—why wait to enhance your look when the world’s most beautiful beaches are calling?



# 👩‍🔬 Is Botox Safe?

When performed by trained professionals, Botox is considered extremely safe. Medical spas in Tulum maintain strict clinical standards using FDA-approved products.

# Common & Mild Side Effects:

* Minimal swelling
* Temporary redness
* Tiny injection-site sensitivity

These resolve quickly and do not disrupt your plans.

# Who Should Avoid Botox?

People who are:

* Pregnant or breastfeeding
* Having severe allergies to ingredients used
* Diagnosed with certain neuromuscular conditions

Your practitioner will do a full evaluation before treatment.



# 🌀 Personalized Aesthetic Enhancement

Botox isn’t one-size-fits-all. A great result requires:

✔ Proper dosage  
✔ Strategic placement  
✔ Understanding facial movement  
✔ Aesthetic eye for natural balance

This is why choosing a licensed medical professional in Tulum is essential.



# 🌴 Enhancing Your Travel Experience

Imagine waking up in a boho-chic boutique hotel, strolling down white-sand beaches, and later walking into a luxurious spa where experts help you achieve a youthful glow. Botox becomes a memory of your trip and a boost of confidence long after the vacation ends.

A refreshed look… and beautiful vacation pictures? Yes, please.

Will a lap/surgery help bowel endo?,"Hi! 

I'm finally getting to see a specialist/surgeon in January for a consult, but I wanted to asked some questions.

First, a little about my case: suspected, hasn't  shown on any scans, did have PCS though and got that sorted last year. Currently on dienogest so I haven't had a period in over a year. Also on Aventil for migraines but it helps a teensy bit for some pain too.

  
My biggest problems: 

\*disabled. I can only stand for an hour before I get bad back pain. Aventil helps with this but standing longer than an hour WILL also flare me and I'll have pain for days. 

\*painful BMS. It's not all of the time but most of the time. Getting worse with flares. I'll feel nauseous first then very sick then pain then gas then completely normal BM. Sometimes cramping after but not always. Also painful gas a lot.

\*I'm already celiac, but I've been losing foods I used to be able to eat. Garlic/onions, decaf coffee, yogurt, rice (regular not rice flour), salad (in fact most veggies except for Cucumber and peppers), meat if it's too fatty, chips etc all in the last 6-8 months. Wondering if I'm having MCAS symptoms but I've read a lot of people saying losing foods is normal for bowel endo until you get an excision. (Is this true)

So basically, do you think going for the lap/excision would make a difference for me? And is there anything I should ask/tell my specialist at my appointment? 

Thanks

🚨 Urgent : Has anyone fully built and publicly deployed a web app on Lovable from India?,"I am building an LMS and Operation System (a baking school) for a client trusting Lovable. Already built a phase 0-1 prototype and the client was convinced enough to make an advance payment. It doesn’t have much complex logics though, doesn’t have very easy logics either. Now I have no other option but to built this somehow.

All I am worried is about:
1. The full deployment of the web app
2. Exporting code (if required)
3. Vendor Lock issue (where I can’t give full access to the client and uninvolve myself)

Should I be worried about anything else?
I am okay hiring any code consultant to help me out

One good thing for me at this point is it is not a mobile app and need not be put on any app store or play store.

Mixed Feelings about recent urgent care visit,"Hi everyone,

I’m feeling worried and scared.

Sunday I started having light spotting and cramps. Monday morning it stopped and I didn’t spot all day until bedtime. On Monday I also got hcg betas done on my own (my Dr didn’t allow me to get them with her because she didn’t want me to stress) and I was at 11,821.

Fast forward this morning, I woke up still spotting and then with a lingering but subtle pain in my right abdomen. Someone on here encouraged me to keep an eye on a possible ectopic so I ended up going to urgent care.

Here is where I’m struggling. They did another hcg test and I’m at 22,000 after only 24 hours before being at 11,821, so that has to be good, right ? They also did an US. Yolk sac there but no embryo visible. According to my LMP I’m 6w2d but I know when ovulated so I’m actually 5w5d. They said it could be too early to see an embryo but couldn’t rule out possible miscarriage. My next appointment which was supposed to my  first is December 8 but they may actually make me wait 11 days for my next scan instead of doing it on the 8th.  So basically I’ll be in limbo for the next 6-11 days and I’m so worried 😭😭😭😭😭 I have a consult Thursday morning to follow up further on my urgent care visit. It’s all so stressful. I know I can’t control any of it but it’s so tough.

AWS Architect/Devops (name it as you like it) with great exposure to bioinformatics looking for job,"First time posting here.

I am AWS cloud engineer (architect, devops, there are many words for the same thing).

In the past 5 years I've been working with bioinformatics teams helping them migrate to the cloud, refactor and upgrade their pipelines to run on AWS infrastructure.

I am fanatically bound to AWS, I do beleive that a person cannot be savvy, fast and cost efficient unless focused only on one cloud provider.

I have been designing, and implementing AWS cloud setup all from VPC networking, VPN Site2Site connections, dockerizing existing legacy tools, writing Gitlab build/test pipelines for legacy and new bioinf docker images used for secondary/tertiary pipelines.

Fully native to AWS incorporating StepFunctions, AWS Batch, Lambda, EventBridge basically AWS native services that are compute bound.

Besides these main tasks I was helping bioinformaticians learn AWS services, especially S3 concepts with Boto3. Demoed numerous PoCs to explain how the cloud is different from on premise. Optimizing usage of reference data for 500+ daily pipelines.

I am located in Serbia (not EU citizen). I can provide B2B contract consultations or employment option depending on potential arrangement.

How would you document this income?,"So I'm fairly new to waveapps for my business and looking for some feedback. I consult with clients. One completes and sends the receipt and pays me while the other I invoice them.

The client in which I invoice them is easy as my invoices from waveapps are sufficient and easily recorded.

The client that sends me the 'invoice'/receipt is confusing me in how I should record this. I fear if I create my own invoice in waveapps it'll complicate/confuse me or my bookkeeper. Where else or how else should I include this income? 

Would Transactions be the best? This is where I am currently leaning

I have a 5 month old baby and fear of being pregnant again,"I had a c-section at the end of June and my period returned on October 29th. Prior to getting pregnant, my periods were always regular, lasting around 28-31 days. On November 28th, I started experiencing mild pre-period cramps, which led me to believe my period was on its way. That same day, I had unprotected sex. However, my period still hasn't arrived, and I'm getting a bit anxious since my doctor advised me to wait at least 18 months before getting pregnant again.

Should I consult a doctor now or wait a bit longer?",sasha6494,1pcvfac,Mommit,03-12-2025,05:06:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1pcvfac/i_have_a_5_month_old_baby_and_fear_of_being/
RRSP transfer to ex-spouse after signing separation agreement,"Hello
I will be signing a separation agreement soon where I will be paying my ex spouse a certain amount of money. A friend told me to do a rrsp to rrsp transfer to get tax credit. My ex spouse is ok with the idea. Questions are:
1-if I transferred a certain amount of money to my rrsp account (my rrsp account is almost empty now so i will need to deposit the money there first) then asked my financial institution to move to my ex spouse rrsp account, do both of us get a tax credit?
2-if i transferred the money, is it a debt that should be paid back to my rrsp like when people use their rrsp money to buy a house?
3-is it a good idea in general or it’s not worth the trouble?
4-how hard is the process itself? Keep in mind that my ex spouse and I have rrsps in different institutions.
5-when should I deposit the money so I would get the tax credit for the 2025 tax year?
6-my ex spouse and I have created the separation agreement without consulting or involvement of lawyers. Would that be ok?

Thanks

Waiting for bottom surgery,"Hey guys, I feel like my desire for phalloplasty has been getting progressively stronger over time and my bottom dysphoria has increased. I think about it every day. My overall dysphoria isn't nearly as bad as it used to be since I've had top surgery, a legal name change, and am on testosterone, but the only bad thing about that is that it's made my dysphoria shift elsewhere (don't get me wrong, I'm beyond grateful to have made it this far into my transition.) If things go as planned I'll hopefully be getting a hysterectomy next year, but I know that the wait for even just a consultation for bottom surgery can take years. It's also been coming up more since I started talking to this girl recently and there being established interest between us. I feel like it's more prevalent than it has been with other people because most of the people I've dated have been trans or non-binary/genderfluid.

Holiday 2025 Solar Marketing: Five Data-Driven Tactics,"# Preparing for an Unusually Competitive Holiday Solar Season

Market analysts expect the 2025 year-end shopping window to generate record interest in residential solar. Several forces converge at once: extended federal tax incentives, higher utility rates, and a backlog of homeowners who delayed projects during earlier supply-chain crunches. Search activity traditionally surges on Black Friday and then tapers slowly through January, creating opportunities for installers that plan campaigns around clearly defined phases.

Below are five evidence-based strategies many specialists anticipate will matter most during the upcoming holiday rush.

## 1. Intensify Organic Visibility With Seasonal SEO

Search intent changes quickly between early November research queries and late-December deal hunting. Site owners who cluster keywords by intent and update metadata regularly stand a better chance of appearing for each phase.

* Expand content around rebate calculators, installer comparisons, and “zero-down solar” long before Black Friday.
* Implement FAQ schema to capture People Also Ask boxes for topics such as ""holiday solar discounts"" and ""winter panel performance"".
* Ensure page load times stay under recommended thresholds. An influx of mobile traffic on shopping weekends makes speed a competitive advantage.
* Roll out limited-time snippets (e.g., countdown structured data) only after pages rank, to avoid appearing overly promotional during the research stage.

## 2. Align Paid Media With Micro-Moments

Historical ad-platform data show sharp spikes in cost-per-click around Cyber Week. Instead of blanket spending, many marketers now scale bids only during micro-moments when intent and likelihood to schedule a consultation are highest.

* Use day-parting to lift bids during lunch breaks and early evenings, times homeowners often research energy costs.
* Shift creative from education (tax credit explainers) to urgency (installation slots closing) as December advances.
* Retarget site visitors across social and display networks with dynamic ads that mirror financing options previously viewed.
* Reserve a modest January budget for “resolution” searches focused on lowering household expenses in the new year.

## 3. Package Financing and Incentives for Gift-Season Appeal

Holiday shoppers respond well to bundled offers and clear cost savings. Solar lends itself to this psychology through structured financing, gift vouchers, and referral credits.

* Combine federal Investment Tax Credit reminders with zero-interest promotional periods to highlight immediate savings.
* Offer transferable battery-storage gift certificates; these can be presented during holiday gatherings and activate additional revenue streams.
* Publish transparent side-by-side comparisons of leasing, power-purchase agreements, and loans so prospects can share options with family decision-makers.
* Cap incentives with well-communicated deadlines to encourage commitment before installers’ winter schedules fill.

## 4. Localize Campaigns Using Permit, Weather, and Demographic Data

Permitting backlogs and seasonal weather patterns vary widely by region. Tailoring messages to local conditions increases credibility and conversion rates.

* Reference recent municipal permit-approval times when discussing installation timelines in ads or landing pages.
* Address snow load or hurricane-rating requirements in states where these issues dominate homeowner concerns.
* Translate creative for neighborhoods with high concentrations of non-English speakers, especially in California and the Southwest.
* Target ZIP codes showing a high density of roofs aged 10–15 years, a common replacement window that coincides with solar upgrades.

## 5. Leverage Social Proof and Referral Momentum

Trust remains a primary hurdle for first-time solar buyers, particularly during promotional seasons when offers can sound too good to be true. Strong social proof reassures skeptics while activating word of mouth.

* Highlight verified review counts, installer certifications, and long-term warranty terms on every holiday campaign asset.
* Send automated post-installation satisfaction surveys; follow high scores with gentle prompts to share photos of decorated, solar-powered homes.
* Feature real monthly electric-bill reductions from customers in similar climates, backed by utility statements where possible.
* Introduce tiered referral rewards—smaller gifts for initial leads, larger ones upon successful contract signing—to sustain momentum through January.

---

### Key Takeaways

1. Keyword clustering and technical SEO need to start months before holiday traffic spikes.
2. Paid media budgets yield better ROI when matched to specific intent windows, not simply to calendar holidays.
3. Financing structures framed as limited-time gifts resonate with household buying psychology.
4. Local data on permits, climate, and demographics increases relevance and lowers acquisition costs.
5. Authentic reviews and structured referral programs build trust while expanding reach without extra ad spend.

Careful orchestration of these tactics—rooted in timely data rather than broad seasonal themes—can position solar firms to capture a disproportionate share of inquiries during the most competitive selling period of the year.

In kerala she used to live alone, never had any breathing trouble, but in Delhi, her condition are getting bad like she is having sore throat, cough and difficulty sleeping ,My friend consulted a doctor for her condition and he suggested to return her to kerala for a while because her lungs wasn't showing good signs

According to him she was there for past 3 months,  and only because of the purifiers the matters didn't get much worse , as we hadn't gone with the cheap alternatives and had chose the best according to reviews and word of mouth 

So here are the ones that actually work for the Delhi conditions

2. Also buy the purifier according to size of the room whether u r planning to keep it in ur living room or bed room

First Year Teacher - I gave up on myself and don't know where to go from here.,"I resigned prior to my first formal evaluation next semester because I was working 25-30 additional hours outside of my contract designing curriculum for 3 preps, and got extremely ill. I started a month into the semester because of a fingerprinting delay, so none of the students initially wanted to be in any of my classes, and I basically just burned myself out trying to develop standards-based lessons that were also engaging enough to meet them where they were. I was assigned a consulting teacher through the district who essentially said that most of my problems were due to perfectionism and minor tweaks to my practice could be made with equity sticks and a word wall to meet the standards, that sort of stuff...and I did what I was told, but my problems felt and continue to feel more despairing and existential than posters in a room. In addition to my major illness, I was getting physically ill on the way to and from work because of the stress.

I resigned, then attempted to rescind my resignation after some other teachers talked me out of it, and this rescission was denied by my contract specialist. I am vacillating between extreme relief and feeling like a complete failure who should have never tried to do this, because I wasted everyone's time, especially the students'. I'm assuming I can't put this on my resume if I'm leaving mid-year, and I am really doubting my future in or out of this field. What do I do? I can't stay, obviously but teaching felt like the only dream I had in my head for the last five years, and I made a lot of personal/financial sacrifices when I got my Master's degree, so it's hard to watch the dream die in this way. Maybe, if I had a better sense of perspective or mindset, none of the factors that ultimately led to the resignation would've been fatal in and of themselves.

"Total newbie, Can anyone give some advice whether to use DALI or 0-10v?","I'm renovating from ground up a new 4 story house, and trying KNX for the first time, the lighting consultant insists 0-10v is better for residential - saying its less complicated, and less maintenance if a DALI driver fails (no need to re-address it again). 

The KNX guys says DALI is better with less cabling etc.

I don't have really too complicated lighting scenes, just a couple of scenes with dimming, all I need it for it to work no matter what happens - driver fails, power surge. 

In what case will KNX lighting stop working? Im really confused, as I'm a lutron user and it really never did fail once. So I'm a bit wary IF KNX controlled lights would fail.

What tools / software are immigration lawyers/consultants  actually using right now?,"Hi all,

This might seem a bit random, but I’m doing some informal research on what tools and software lawyers/consultants are actually using day to day, especially in immigration law (but I’m happy to hear from other practice areas too).

What I’m curious about:

* Case management tools
* Document automation / drafting
* Intake, scheduling, billing tools
* Any AI tools you’ve actually found useful (not just hype)
* Anything that noticeably speeds up your workflow

I’m the “tech friend” in my circle and would love to give better recommendations to a couple of lawyers I know, rather than just guessing.

"Newly pregnant, haven’t eaten for four days. Please help.","Hello everyone. So, my husband and I just found out that we’re pregnant with our second, and we’ve only had one consultation appointment so far as well as a pregnancy confirmation appointment (typical pee in a cup, but didn’t/wouldn’t do blood panel). 

Before finding out I was pregnant, I often smoked (legal) THC to help me with my eating disorder and my sensory disorder as I am Autistic, (which in my state there are legal over the counter forms such as THCP, THCA, Delta-9, etc). 

Ever since I have found out I’m pregnant I have stopped smoking it completely. I’m talking cold turkey. 
I keep seeing so many articles about how it’s “technically safe” but I’m just not willing to take those chances. 

It has been four days, almost five, that I can’t eat anything besides peppermints and maybe some water here and there. I’m weak, exhausted, can’t eat, can’t sleep; I called my local emergency room but they said they can’t legally tell me if I should come in or not. Which doesn’t make sense cause their job is to help us but, go figure.

I’ve tried everything to help the nausea, and I seriously really don’t want to smoke. Now I’m the weakest I’ve ever felt- driving home was a challenge enough. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel awful, I don’t have an appointment until January 15th, and I can’t keep anything down. My husband tells me the risks of malnutrition are greater than smoking- but one Google search tells me that smoking THC while pregnant leads to SIDS, stillborns, the absolute worst. Not to mention the legal consequences that could come with it as well. I don’t want that. 

My ex-husband hurt our child significantly and CPS didn’t even take our son from him, but I’m told THC will absolutely do just that to our family.

I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t battling between malnutrition or wanting to smoke to help feed my baby- but I really don’t don’t don’t DONT want to do that! I just want to be able to eat and drink and support this baby with what they need. I don’t think I’m longer than 5 weeks, if that. 

I’m at a loss at what to do. I’m afraid of starving my baby but I rly don’t want to smoke. Please,
Please help. 

Thank you in advance. 

Edit: for all the incredibly judgy women below, please use your eyes and re-read my post instead of just skimming. I shouldn’t have to explain to you how to read. I just said I *completely stopped* using THC and don’t want to use it anymore. Please stop giving me hate for a good decision I’ve made. This is exactly why so many people have told me to avoid this subreddit like the plague.

Booking a medical check up,Hi I want to book an appointment because I have a update on my illness and a few problems that I have. Which consultation is this? I don't want any shots. I just want to talk about the issue and how we can move on from there. So what do I choose? ,shygirl_ling,1pcv203,unsw,03-12-2025,04:47:32,https://i.redd.it/ku75hr2w5x4g1.jpeg
"Posting on multiple platforms was overwhelming me, finally found a system that works","

Ive been solo for 8 months now, building a consulting practice. I knew I needed social media presence but honestly had no idea how much work it would be
I started posting on linkedin because that's where my clients are, then realized i should probably be on X too. then someone told me instagram was important for personal branding and suddenly Im supposed to show up on five different platforms every single day
The problem is not the ideas, I have plenty to say. The problem is formatting everything correctly and actually getting it posted. linkedin wants long form storytelling, twitter wants short punchy threads, instagram needs square images with specific dimensions like I dont have that much time
I was spending my entire sunday morning just resizing images and rewriting captions to fit each platform. I felt like i was working for the algorithms instead of building my actual business.
I switched to a different approach last month, I create one piece of content that represents my thinking, then use blotato to handle the platform specific formatting and posting. Still kinda takes time but cut it from like 6 hours to maybe 2 hours

Finally feels manageable showing up consistently across platforms without losing every weekend to content work

Anyone else find this overwhelming at first or was it just me??",Reasonable_Capital65,1pcux6z,Solopreneur,03-12-2025,04:40:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Solopreneur/comments/1pcux6z/posting_on_multiple_platforms_was_overwhelming_me/
Fck Thalasemia,"So I am a 20M and I have thalassemia major, which means I have to take blood transfusions every 15 days. Now I am also going through another treatment because of iron overload. I have to take Deferasirox (bottle) for 17 hours, and it has been 6 months, but my ferritin is still too high, so the doctor told me to continue for three more months. I’m not even going to college because of this treatment, and I have to stay home due to the risk of infections. It’s enough now. I feel like I can’t handle it anymore. I feel tired and restless.

I feel very lonely as I don’t have any real good friends. I was bullied in school because of my disease, and even my own friends used to talk behind my back. They all were snakes and made fun of me. Because of these experiences, I became an introvert. Even now, in college, people make fun of me because of my appearance—how I am 20 years old but look like a 15–16-year-old kid. My skin turns yellow when my blood is low and it’s time for a transfusion.

People probably love and miss their school days, but I’m not going to miss mine. The only person I would remember is my former teacher who taught me maths in 5th grade. She was beautiful, kind, and caring. I liked her because she was the one who talked very kindly with me.. and i liked that attention she gave me..

I met her after 7 years (when i was in same school but high school that is 12th std and was last year there) so it was two days after teachers day i saw her and followed to her staff room and gave her a gift (it was a pen with her name sticker which was made my me) i told mam this is for you and she replied omg thank you so much.. I said welcome mam and she said I thought may be you are only there but due to mask I didn't... (so i was wearing a mask so she said she thought it's me but couldn't recognise as i was were mask I said yes mam then she said now how are you? I said i am fine mam and after that some other teachers called her and i had my 12th class so i left..

After that, I used to message her good morning and wish her on festivals. On New Year 2023, I messaged her saying happy new year.. i saw i was blocked.. yeah she blocked me... but I tried to call her thinking maybe I wasn’t blocked, and my number wasn’t blocked, so I panicked and cut the call. She gave me two missed calls, but I didn’t pick up because I felt ashamed. (Ig she hadn’t saved my number, so I think she didn’t know it was me)

After that on 2023 5th September teachers day I smsED (as number was not block i was blocked only on WhatsApp) her happy teachers day and she said this is not (her name) number her daughter is using this number now... (and it was a lie as i could see her dp in my mom's phone and even in true caller.. so after that i never messaged or call her again but i still miss her as she was the only one who I had trusted.. who was kind to me.. So Coming Back to present i suddenly remembered her.... I felt was dumb to do all that.. I am missing her so badly wanted to talk to her.. but i am afraid what she would have thought of me...

I am tired with this shit treatment and i am feeling very lonely and have tears in my eyes thinking I don't have anyone.. I didn't found anyone kind and trusted.. I am writing all this with tears in my eyes.. My college friends also treat me as side option and make fun sometimes... I literally don't have anyone to share my feelings.. It was just her who made me feel good when i had no one in school.. got bullied so i don't have any good memories except her.. I was doing my work of freelancing and had started earning some money but just because of this shit treatment i had to stop it which made me more and more lonely and depressed..

Update: So I had uploaded this post 3 months ago and just after this post after 15 days i got my feritin reports and doctor told to continue the treatment for more 2-3 months… Also many ppl recommended me not to contact her but I took the risk and smsed first time after 2023 on 23 sept saying:

Hi Ma'am, I hope you're doing well.  As you know i have thalassemia so.. Recently I've been on IV treatment that takes long hours and It’s been around 6 months passed to it now and it's still going so l spend a lot of time just resting in bed. While scrolling WhatsApp, I came across our old chat and realised how immature I was with the messages I sent back then. I felt guilty and wanted to apologise sincerely and request you to forgive me. I also wanted to say I still remember your kindness from school when i had a bad day and it always meant a lot to me.Please keep me in your blessings. And she also replied in an hour saying: Surely will convey your msg (she was still pretending that her daughter is using her number) and i said: Thnx let me know... would be really glad if I could talk to her even for just a min. so after this i waited for two days hoping for her reply but no reply came so i even mailed her on her mail idk even if she got it so i sent a follow back sms too on 26th sept saying: Good evening Ma’am, I just wanted to check if my message was conveyed. I truly value your blessings and it would mean a lot to know of it reached her. Thank you for your time and efforts 🙏

But no response came from her... i didn’t send her more messages after that ofc but i was infact i am still just broken now.. I never wanted this to happen… My favourite person to block me.. that also my favourite teacher.. who was very special.. But i tried to forget this and i was still going with the treatment and it was frustrating i cried in my room alone as i the saline bottle went for 17 hours and i couldn’t go out as you all know and i was also missing her… some how days passed but on 11th oct i almost met death..

What happened was, I went for a blood transfusion and started shivering. After an hour, I had to go again for a second transfusion, and once again I started shivering, but eventually got fine. However, when I got home and took that Desferal or whatever it’s called, I started shivering again this time it was too much to handle. I also got a fever of 110°F, and I started thinking something had gone wrong with the treatment. I couldn’t stand properly, everything looked blurry, and I felt like I was losing my vision slowly.

Not just that my heartbeat became extremely fast, and for a moment, I genuinely thought this was the end of my life. I tried to distract myself by praying to God, but then overthinking hit again I started feeling like I was only praying because I thought I was about to die. So, I tried to think of her and the 12th gift memory, but I couldn’t even imagine it properly..instead, my mouth started trembling as if I was about to cry.

I decided to empty my mind and focus on something, so I stared at a photo frame but the words on it looked 3D and blurry again. My heart was still racing, my head started vibrating, and I felt like I would die within minutes. Somehow, I managed to control my thoughts until I reached the hospital.

After reaching there, I found out my heartbeat was so fast because of the high fever and also because I was scared and overthinking a lot. So after that on nov month end i checked for feritin again and it was better it dropped to 3.8k and doctor told to continue treatment for just 15 more days and then i can remove the iv/piccline from hand.. so after that on 28th nov the piccline was removed and i was finally free from this shit treatment but my body was paining a lot i got some chamak or whatever you know idk on my back and above chest… and my badluck doesn’t ends here i checked for feritin reports again on same day when piccline was removed and at night i got reports and feritin was increased to 5k… what should i even say.. also the body pain didn’t end even after weeks so doctor told may be consult bones doctor because may be my bones are weak and maybe he will give injections to make them strong or medicine as thala major do face this.. so now one more shit came and my health issues doesn’t end and i am also stressed about my feritin but doctor told to check it again after 1 month and if it’s still high then he will add medicine but if still doesn’t have much affect then may be i have to start that shit fckin treatment again and take that damn iv/piccline on my another hand… i mean wtf is this life i also going through stress for my career and what would i do in future.. what am i supposed to do this life feels like hell… i have to consult bones doctor too now… I feels like crying and i still do miss my mam so badly… I am going through lot… I hope my feritin becomes normal… I have dealed with a lot of things but no one said me that it’s ok i am there for you.. i am depressed and feeling very low I don’t know what i would do in future",HallComprehensive114,1pcuv4x,OffMyChestIndia,03-12-2025,04:37:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1pcuv4x/fck_thalasemia/
Which ANZSCO code fits my MBA + Branch Manager experience best?,"Hi everyone,  
I’m hoping to get some advice on the right ANZSCO code for my skills assessment.

I have an MBA (completed in 2015) and around 1 year 9 months of post-MBA experience in India as a Branch/Center Manager at a training institute.   
My work included 

* SWOT / GAP / cost–benefit analysis
* identifying operational inefficiencies and proposing improvements
* strategic planning for branch growth
* coordinating faculty and scheduling academic programs
* improving student engagement and overall performance
* business development and market share growth
* monitoring KPIs and preparing reports for management

I’m wondering if this experience is suitable for **Management Consultant (ANZSCO 224711)** under VETASSESS?  
If not, what would be the best occupation with the highest acceptance rate for someone with my background for visas **189, 190, or 491**?

Any guidance or similar experiences would really help. Thanks!",Roovya,1pcuuyb,AusVisa,03-12-2025,04:37:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusVisa/comments/1pcuuyb/which_anzsco_code_fits_my_mba_branch_manager/

ENCLOSEMENT - THE CANON PROLOGUE (The Proclamation of Parkum),"Long ago, Venlil-kind had achieved great heights, yet in their folly destroyed their foundation. Our ancestors became debauched, and ancient evils were championed by the dominant people of Primmoul, these scores of reprobates who spurned righteousness, and insulted the holy. They treated with dark powers and in return for unimaginable prosperity, waged and won a war to oppress all other peoples.

Upon their victory, Solgalick punished the Primmoul for the bloodshed and erasure of the memories of the Old World, and changed their bodies into warped decrepit shadows of what they were meant to be. It was these Venlil who were the ancestors of most of all Venlil alive today, yet still there were those who had refused to abandon the divine and managed to survive, the few who hid in plain sight amongst the Sea of Herds whose own superiority rested upon pride and deceit endured, and it was these last followers of the Virtuous Gods who survived, it was their descendants who praye for the wicked times to end.

Untold years, Solgalick answered their prayers at last, stepping down from the heavens to sire within a virtuous virgin, the Deliverer. Hartek the Resurrector.

Hartek, due to his divine heritage, was the first Venlil in ages whose body was untainted by the curse, and with his guile and wisdom he won over the people of Primmoul, then won power over the entirety of Primmoul. And for the first time in millennia, the wickedness that had consumed our race for generations was challenged as he revived worship of the Gods.

But the Primmoul’s Masters, the fiends who had prospered from the desecration of all that is good, were not so willing to be swept beneath. And so they summoned the Devourers, a mighty race of monsters who prowled between the stars, only appearing when they perceived weakness.

Hartek waged a valiant war against these abhorrent creatures, yet in the decisive hour, the elite of Primmoul summoned demons to strike against our defenders as they fought, leaving Primmoul powerless to be ravaged and laid to waste in a day of fire and blood, terror and agony. By the time the Devourers moved on, only a few survived their wrath, yet in the next instant, the Humans appeared. For reasons unknown, they captured all who remained, listless and broken, and released our ancestors to a new land; Valonga. Then Hartek  forged a pact with these creatures, striking a deal to provide them with something in return for their aid.

Yet, when the most loyal followers of the ways of Primmoul, rewarded for their devotion through living in dominion under evil spirits, declared war, the Humans, for reasons incomprehensible to all betrayed the virtuous Lord Hartek, and cast the Totem Towers from the heavens; artifacts carved from an unidentifiable black stone, standing so high they soared into the clouds, branded with the visage of horrible beasts the like had never before been seen. This was the first pivotal change in our history.

The Totem Towers encircled the lands where all our kind resided, and they enclosed us all within, for the Totem Towers exerted an unidentifiable force that kept all who approached them from passing them. It was this barrier that had sealed us away from the world beyond which defined our entire history.

The second change occurred right as our history had started being written down. The great King, Hartek, gathered all of the thinkers and wise Ven from around all lands who had sworn fealty to him, and separated the Physicians from the Healers, the Philosophers from the Magi, and formalized the use of the supernatural as a distinctly separate study from that of the natural world. This had a profound impact on the society of the kingdom he created, Hartekmoul, and was inspired by the Totem Towers for the express purpose of conquering the Human’s design, and breaking through the Enclosement.

Yet despite all efforts, none had yet accomplished the impossible task of subverting the Human’s mysterious power.

The third change came a hundred years later, and was looked back upon by all as the dawn of a time of troubles and suffering. The Gonimites, a Venlil people once isolated to the East of the Kam Mountains, had grown too big. The Gonimites were Venlil, yet that was the only thing we had in common, they were the successors of Primmoul, and continued their iniquities, they worshiped the same evil spirits, fabricated their own folklore, and conjured their history from lies and the fancies of their degenerate nobility, and through horrid and debauched practices obliterated the vigors of their minds and the strength of their souls. To call what they built a civilization would be a falsehood.

The Gonimites revealed themselves to the rest of Venlilkind by invading all of the lands to the West of the territories that they had ravenously expanded into, where they quickly became a curse upon the rest of our kind. The Hartekmoulites led the resistance, but none had the strength to withstand Gonim’s sheer numbers.

We were subjugated, and for a hundred years, we had to endure the wickedness of the Gonimites as they forced their detestable ways upon us, and forced us to give strip our lands bare in order to pay tribute to them.

For a hundred years, we watched them squander our wealth… Yet it was a century after the Gonimites ruled that the fourth great event of our history had occurred, worst of them all. It was King Parkum who had led us in the dawn of those days, and it was his response that would change the course of Venlil History.

**Memory transcription subject: Unmek, Hartekmoulite Mining Mogul**

I stood in the shade atop the roof of my office, looking down at the business of the minors under my employ working. On the roof, I had the perfect vantage point to behold all the work of the people beneath me as they moved dirt, rocks, and other materials out of the tunnel below.

Most people would think this place a mine, and I wouldn’t blame them, I owned many mines myself, but this wasn’t a mine. This was a project commissioned by the King of Hartekmoul himself.

Only the King of Hartekmoul had the money to devote to this massive undertaking.

I looked up from the site of the tunnel, and stared ahead in the distance. The Totem Towers loomed ominously, impossibly tall black poles that encircled the lands where every Venlil lived in.

All across the horizon, no matter where one looked there wasn’t a place free from those poles.

That was the reason why very few Venlil resided this close to the Enclosement.

*Now, it’s time again,* I recognized, prompting me to leave my spot overlooking the work site, and enter the tunnel.

I opened the wooden door, the only thin holding the door to the mudbrick wall were strings. When I closed the door behind me, its bottom dragging on the floor, I found myself inside my house. I took note of the meager possessions I had brought with me from my original home as I walked down the earthen stairs. There were vases filled with various items, racks mounted on the ceiling where multiple kinds of plants hung down, a cooking area, a spot designated for clothing, and of course, in this central room, there was an altar to the one Virtuous Venlil God, Solgalick.

Signs of the other chambers within this house could be seen, also, there was another wooden door, where we slept, a larger, far sturdier door that was guarded at all times by two warriors from my retinue, geared with bronze armor and weapons, they truly were a spectacular sight. I was responsible in many ways for them having such high quality gear, I had been blessed to discover two massive deposits of tin in my younger years, a resource that the King of Hartekmoul desired intensely. I still remember how he had invited me personally to his palace after hearing of my discovery, and what he had planned to do with it.

As weird as it is to claim, Parkum and I are friends, now. Helped that I didn’t try to get all the money I could from selling tin to him, but that relationship of trust was why he gave me this project. Now, far more than his Palace Guard in Sinsodam will be able to sport bronze.

Movement came from a space sectioned off with a dark red curtain between our room and the vault where the worker’s salary was kept, and from this disturbance of the curtain, Kamsi emerged. She was clothed in a simple green dress that reached just a little past her knees, and had a sash on over her chest.

“Hello dear,” my wife greeted me fondly. “I just came back from emptying the toilet.”

“Kamsi,” I firmly, but not unwarmly, scolded her. “You need to be resting, you shouldn’t be carrying heavy loads.”

“I know, but Honsi needed the fresh air!” She rebutted as she returned to her room, tilting her body in a way where I would be able to see our daughter, slung up on her back.

Carefully, I walked up to my wife, and rubbed the head of our infant firstborn, who cooed in response, and raised her tiny hands up to greet her father.

Kamsi is another benefit that I have Parkum to thank for. Only those possessing the demigod blood of Hartek are pure, and bear no signs of the corruption that afflicted us when our ancestors fell to degeneracy. As such, Kamsi is taller than myself, her legs allow her to run far better, the breath in her lungs is longer, stronger. And they could smell, too.

Hartek during his rule had sired thirty children, the vast majority of whom were female, and married the sons of the Venlil he trusted most, while he gave the right to his crown to the bloodline of his only son. In gratitude for my contributions to the kingdom, Parkum presented before me a lineup of many bachelorettes to choose from, all of whom shared his ancestry, but they weren’t nobles. Only the sons of the daughters of Hartek had the right to continue the noble bloodlines, and those females were descended from the daughters. But Kamsi was the kindest and gentlest of them all, which is why she won. All the descendants of Hartek were graced with the same strength, vigor, and health that their ancestor possessed, including my wife and child, but a baby is still a baby!

“She’s only two days free from the womb, that *fresh air* could kill her!” I reprimanded, letting the softness in my heart that my baby evoked slip through. “Especially in light of how much dust there is!”

After hugging my wife goodbye, I left and continued my journey.

I re-entered the world of the worksite, walking past the two guards stationed at the door of my home. Again it was the same routine, gingerly I walked past numerous Venlil going about their business.

“Hey, boss,” a voice spoke up from my right, and I saw a group of miners, about three of them. “Our pay is secured, right?”

Even though we were here to dig, in this wasteland, everyone knew our objective; to bypass the Enclosement by digging underneath it. Even though the Venlil here work willingly, Parkum’s money is the only reason this campsite is still running and everyone here knows it. There’s nothing in the ground of this barren wasteland, not even copper to make this campsite anything other than a drain on the King’s resources.

But no, this isn’t a campsite, there are several thousand Venlil here, filled with miners and diggers to carry out the project, the merchants to bring the food and water in, the carpenters and builders to make the homes every would live in, the doctors to care for everyone, the dentists, the religious officials, entertainers, not to mention all of their wives and children triple the population. Unmekanat is a town just like any other, one that will either be abandoned, or become the stopping point between entering and exiting the Enclosement.

“Under watch day and night,” I reassured them. “Nothing like that incident from two months ago is going to happen, I assure you. Even with a delay in the delivery, I have enough in the vault to make sure your compensation is guaranteed.”

“Good to hear,” the miners nodded, slightly put more at ease. “Because if we can’t dig a way through, then we need to come back with something to show for it.”

They didn’t need to know that the money would come from my own personal treasury.

As I walked off, I considered the knowledge that Parkum had given me.

If I succeed in my endeavor, then the odds are extremely high that the Humans themselves may notice. They probably would not take kindly to us breaking from their prison, and may try to move to keep us in check. In anticipation of this outcome, Parkum has sent a thousand warriors from all corners of his kingdom, each with a bronze breastplate, helmet, and weapon, alongside one hundred Magi.

However, nobody here but me knows the true scope of the militant presence, here. The warriors venture into the surrounding wilderness to patrol for any unwanted presences, dangerous animals, outlaws, the like. They also make sure to keep order in the town, acting as law enforcers and fire watch. But nobody knows that there are a thousand of Hartek’s bravest sons ready to spring into action at any instant.

Nerves are frayed enough just from being within sight of the Enclosement, if even the possibility of Humans coming to put us down enters their mind, then their reputation for invincibility will stop the operation before any violence is commenced to begin with!

But regardless, it is time. As I entered the tunnel, my paws started hitting stone rather than dirt. The workers had bothered to make the entrance look better than an ugly hole in the ground. As I walked past the large wooden stake in the earth, Venlil miners carrying baskets of soil and rock walked past me, and they moved further to the side of the tunnel, even though it was ten Venlil wide.

Down down and further down the tunnel I went, torches replaced the sun as I joined the laborers in the darkness. As I walked, holes began appearing to my left, the prior attempts, each hole an entirely separate tunnel that after it failed, we returned to this original tunnel to dig further down.

There was no way to tell how deep we had to dig to go under the Enclosement until it worked.

There was a super long rope in the center of the tunnel, painted a bright color so that the torchlight would make it easy to see. The rope extended all the way to the mouth of the tunnel outside and was tied to the wooden stake planted outside. Its purpose; to measure how long the miners had to dig before they could begin to dig up.

Soon enough I reached the end of the tunnel that curved down, and I began the walk to the left, and became completely engulfed in darkness.

On on and on I walked, I kept on going in the dusty air, walking past the occasional sound of a Ven carrying a basket of Earth back all the way outside.

But soon enough, just on time, the darkness finally gave way to torch light. And a familiar scene emerged before me.

The site of the miners work came before me, there were many baskets lying empty at the back, at the edge of the wall, there were several toilets, and there were spare torches. A dozen miners stood, each of them carrying a tool, some shovels, others pickaxes, all made of bronze.

“How goes the digging?” I asked he crew, they were panting in exhaustion, so tired that they couldn’t even speak.

One of them simply looked at me, grabbed the pickaxe, walked up to the wall and swung as hard as he could.

His muscles strained, and he let out sounds of pained exertion, however, his pickaxe was frozen in place. Despite him trying to move it with all his might, the only thing he could make it do was twitch in midair.

Inert.

Unable to move one hair’s width closer.

“AH!” The miner ultimately let go of the pickaxe, which flew backwards, out of his hand. He backed away and sat down.

“Failure… failure… yet another failure… even down here, the magic of the Totem Towers keeps us from breaching the world outside…” a miner mumbled dejectedly.

*Not good, not good in the slightest,* I shook my head, an ugly feeling rising up from within me. *Parkum sent me out here two years ago, and now we’re going to have to make another tunnel all over again! How much longer are we going to keep at this?!*

“Pick up your tools, and spool up the rope,” I ordered the crew, who shambled into action. “We’re returning to the surface.”

We walked all the way up to the surface, and as we did, we turned away the new miners arriving to relieve the current ones of their shift. On and on we marched, gathering the rope and the workers until we reached the surface and its dying light, our mood dreary. Everyone knew what our arrival meant, the dyed rope in tow as the sun sunk below the horizon, casting the sky in dying light.

Yet another tunnel proved a dead end, the Enclosement remains unbroken.

We handed off the rope to another group of servants, who in torchlight coiled it back around the stake, in the meantime I walked off to the break area to the side and sat down. Looking up at the skies of Valonga that we had lived under our whole lives.

The stars were beginning to appear, and as the dark came, so too did the whispers.

“Should we really be surprised that we were stopped by the Enclosement again?” “At least we’re getting paid to act out this futile quest.” “The Human’s magic is invincible… we’re never going to be able to break free.” “We’re stuck in here forever with the Gonimites!”

I stood up, cutting through the dismal air with my voice.

“Alright everyone, I know we failed again, but that doesn’t mean we’re going to fail every time. All of you are dismissed. Rest for a couple of days, while I’ll consult with the… to…” my voice trailed off as I saw it. A cold chill suddenly wafted over the entirety of the crowd, and in the dying light, *something* moved about, like the surface of a river rippling from an Akomfish swimming just beneath its surface.

*But this was in the air, in the entirety of the air, something was moving. Something unseen. Something supernatural, and it caused ripples of panic.

“What is that?” “Huh? Where?” “Look! Something’s wrong with the sky!” “It’s the Humans! They’re taking revenge upon us for trying to break free!” “Oh Solgalick! Forgive us all for our sins!”

But just as quickly as the rippling began, they stopped, and everything returned to normal. Even while everyone waited for something else to happen, on edge. Only a brief coughing fit broke the silence.

Just as I dared to believe that it was nothing…

“UNMEK! SHE’S DYING!” Kamsi’s voice shouted out, panicked as she ran outside of our home. “IT’S HONSI! HONSI IS DYING!”

My heart stopped in my chest as my wife quickly approached, her green dress fluttering in the air as she ran. Everyone stepped aside to let the wife of the master of the town through, a good many bowing in deferential respect.

As she approached, our baby in her arms, my blood ran cold at the sight before us.

Her eyes were shut, dirtied with a blood orange scum, she was violently trembling, and squeaking pathetically as her nostrils leaked snot endlessly. She started coughing, a black splatter appearing on her mother’s white arms.

Her fur was even falling out! This can’t be the result of bad air!

“MAGI! HEALERS! PRIESTS!” I bellowed out the order as the coughing resumed and intensified. “COME AT ONCE! OUR DAUGHTER HAS BEEN CURSED!”

But when someone vomited, I looked around.

I saw the Venlil who just purged his stomach collapse into his own spewage, his friend leaned down to try to help him.

“Gan! Are you alright?”

He wasn’t the only one, all across the crowd, Venlil were erupting into coughing fits, vomiting, and a few collapsed without warning.

“What’s going on?!” “He’s dead!” “The Humans! They’ve cursed us!”

I looked on the scene of calamity before us all, and spotted a priest running towards the crowd.

“Solgalick protect us…” I whispered in horror and confusion at the grim sight, holding my wife close to me.

The typical rhythmic push and pull of the sawblade continued on as we sliced through the felled tree, as usual.

“You know, I really wonder what Lord Yanbat is wanting to build with all this wood,” I asked. But instead of the typical response, instead, he collapsed onto the ground.

“Huh?” I voiced my confusion. I looked over the log we were processing, the last one for the night, and saw him lying prone on the ground, motionless.

Something’s wrong.

“Hey!” I called out, letting go of my saw blade and running around to help him up. “Banvek, what’s wrong? speak to me!”

When I knelt down to shake him, there was no response!

“Someone! Help! Someone get Amsi!” I cried out to the rest of the camp, who all turned away from their work to rush over. “My brother’s not breathing!”

**Memory transcription subject: Taffa, Shonite weaver**

I pushed the needle through yet again, going through the familiar motions alongside the other wives and daughters in the creation of the garments that the King of Hartekmoul had wanted to buy.

Fabric made from the fibers of the Phaunella stems is in high demand from even more than whatever the royal craftsven wants them for.

“Harn came back from the market again last night,” Amappi chatted about her husband. “And guess what? He still wasn’t able to sell all of his flowers!”

“That’s only natural,” Lova, the youngest in the room, responded halfheartedly. “With how much more of the plant we’ve been growing, it’s only natural that our own husbands would come back with extra.”

“But now that is every harvest!” Jahi, the eldest of the whole village, voiced her concern. “Everyone loves Phaunella Flowers to eat, the fact that our husbands, sons, and brothers keep returning late, with baskets of flowers still in their carts, means that we’ve grown so much that most of it is going to waste! When’s the last time any of them sold all their food to spare before sundown?”

But I was only half listening, focused entirely on my work. The practiced and familiar movements came harder, my arms started to ache for the first time doing this work since I was a little girl. And my vision became hazy. Is this because of my pregnancy? There’s a pup in my belly, but that never stopped the others… did it?

My breathing started to become labored, and…

“Oh,” I stopped weaving, which caused everyone to stop their conversation and look at me.

“Taffa? What’s the matter?”

“Oh… oh no… everyone. Get me to the Healer, something’s wrong with me!” I tried to get up, but my legs refused to move, causing me to fall down. Everything was numb.

“Taffa!” My sister, Hiysu, shot up, and caught me before I could land on my pregnant belly.

But the sudden jerking movement upset my stomach.

“Oh, I-AAGHGLHBLGH!” Everyone recoiled as I suddenly and violently vomited all over the Phaunella loincloth I had been working on. And that was the last thing my eyes could perceive as my mind descended into fog.

“Taffa!” The rest of them came to pick me up, I felt their hands lift me up onto their shoulders, but my vision became blurry.

“By the Flame of Sinsodam! Why are her eyes crossed!?” “There’s blood in her vomit!” “Oh! Oh! Everyone step careful! She’s pooping!”

“We need to get her help, now! Find a Puller Guildsven!”

**Memory transcription subject: Chebaf, Kalawim Merchant**

My walk had dragged on far too late, I had gotten taken a wrong turn, forcing me and my bodyguards to camp on the side of the road. And now the sun was directly above our heads. I had gotten myself on the right road this time, I recognize the plants, but if I wasn’t able to reach the town of Geshinrob soon, then I’d have no choice but to stop again, this heat is barely tolerable!

“And all of this for a metal that might not actually exist,” one of my assistants grumbled as he pulled my cart.

“If bronze was a Human Hand, then I don’t think the captain of the watch would be interested in buying a weapon made from it,” I responded, adjusting my wide brimmed hat.

Our walk took us over a gentle upward incline and as we walked, the trees grew scarcer, and the plains gave way to the scrubland of the path I had walked so many times.

“Let’s be thankful that the Hartekmoulites believe in treating their guests properly,” I uttered.

“Hey, what’s that?” One of my escorts asked, pointing further ahead. “It’s… pink?”

And there it was, just before the hills very top, I saw something unusual underneath a bush on the side of the path.

But then I realized, and hurried ahead, and everyone started moving faster. And just as I suspected, it was a Venlil, a female descendant of Hartek, if those stories are to be believed. She was covered in garments that had been dyed the color of the sunset, and these garments were wrapped all around her, most remarkably, though, she had a flag attached to her tail that was the same color.

Most concerningly, she her breathing was labored, and some sort of blue fluid was leaking out of her nose.

“A daughter of Hartek?” my newest assistant asked, struggling with his bag of goods. “Why is she dressed like that?”

“She’s a Messenger maid!” I explained, dropping my possessions and leaning down to put her on my shoulders. “And she clearly needs help!”

“But she’s *sick!* You might catch it!”

“But she’ll die out here if we just pass by!” I grunted as I lifted her up. One of my guards helped me while another grabbed my bag.

When overtook the hill, however, that was when we saw Geshinrob in the distance.

Multiple fires had broken out in the town, and the smoke was wafting into the air, the walls, however, had not been damaged.

Before anyone could say anything, we were interrupted.

“YOU!” An angry voice accused us! Causing us to freak out as we turned towards the source of the sound. “DROP HER RIGHT THIS INSTANT!”

It was a group of Hartekmoulite Warriors, they weren’t Hartek’s descendants, but their wooden armor was carved and painted with the design motifs typical of their culture. These Venlil rapidly approached us, and my guards put themselves between them and us, drawing their weapons.

“Wait! Don’t attack!” I pleaded to both my guards and the Hartekmoulites. “My name is Chebaf, we’re traveling merchants!”

“DON’T LIE TO ME!” The leader of the Hartekmoulite Guards accused, ears pointed all the way back and tail gesticulating. He was angry, and scared, they all were, those fires in the town? What happened?

“We just found her like this, I swear!” We pleaded as another sound started coming from behind.

“You’re Kalawim! This is just some plot to get one over your rivals, huh? Revenge for the wars between us? You’re not going to pull one over on me!” the leader of the Guards accused just as the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps overcame the hill.

He was a friend from my hometown, the same place I had departed from, he had been running all the way here. And the guards turned to face him as several other ven followed and came to a stop behind the first one, panting and wheezing, all of them carried large but empty sacks tied to their waists with vines.

“Wuvek? What’s going on?” I asked in confusion, turning away from the guards.

“Chebaf!” Wuvek gasped out. “It’s… our home! We’ve… been hit… with some… sort of… plague!”

My blood ran cold, a disease outbreak? This early in the Spring?

“Our medicines… can’t even soothe their pain!” Wuvek desperately gasped out. “Symptoms are… wildly different! Fastest… of us… were sent… to get help… we need… Hartekmoulite… healing magic!”

“You too?” I heard whispered out, and I turned to see all signs of hostility had evaporated from the guards.

“Come, inside the city, we’ll take her!” The Guard who had moments ago so flagrantly accused me of malfeasance walked up, and took the Messenger Maid atop his shoulders, alongside another one of his cohorts. I took my bag from the guard who held it for me and we made our way down to the town that had become far more troubled up close than it was far away.

**Memory transcription subject: Lank, Hartekmoulite Healer Magi**

“By the balance between Earth and Wind, the separation of Flame and Water. I plead with you, to reclaim the state in which you were meant to be! I offer this gift to you, be healed!” I cast the incantation on the boy, trying to ignore the moaning and wailing outside, his chest covered with a poultice medicine to ease his lungs and increase the effect of my magic.

As my benign energies poured into him, his labored breathing came easier, and clearer. Hope surged in my chest, before he ultimately entered yet another violent coughing fit, green spewing from his eyes as he thrashed and cried out on the table in pain.

“AAH! AAAAH!” He shouted as his arm knocked over a pot placed to his side, I caught it before the jar of the precious poultice fell to the floor and shattered. That medicine cost half a year’s worth of my pay, and it shouldn’t been enough to cure ten full grown Venlil men!

But… his symptoms only paused for the briefest moment!

“An entire jar. I used an entire jar on this child, why won’t it work?!” I whispered in dismay as I placed the vase on the counter, before walking out of the room.

“I’ll be back, soon, young one. Stay strong,” I said to my patient before entering the larger house of healing.

Through one of the doorways, I saw one of my peers frantically reading through fired clay tablets of various maladies, but finding nothing as he sat down in our library. Others were rushing to and from the other rooms where their patients were, one of them carrying medicines, another was carting her dead patient out of the facility, a sorrowful expression in her eyes.

Eventually, I found the waiting room absolutely crowded with the sick and dying, illuminated by the rays of light pouring down from the thatch roof. A Venlil stood near the entrance doorway, eyes closed, pressing his hands against his head and his head against the doorway, another rocked back and forth, eyes manic. The scene of chaos was serenaded by screams of pain, horror, and panic wafted in from outside, complimenting the sounds of coughing, retching, moaning, and other noises that the suffering ill made. I skirted my way through the crowd until I found the Master of the House of Healing, an elderly Venlil Matriarch by the name of Gehi, the one who trained me in the healing arts.

“Master Gehi,” I shouted over the din of the crowd, she held her head in her hands, but was so overtaken by dismay that she didn’t even respond.

Further, the crowd was too loud, I need to come closer in order for her to hear me! I made my way to her, pushing past several more afflicted, including one who growled menacingly at everyone who came near.

“RA!” The growling Venlil snarled as she jumped up at me.

“Ah! G-get away!” I reflexively cried out as the female, a daughter of Hartekmoulite, was pulled back by a group of other afflicted Venlil who had enough strength to restrain her, or at least distract her long enough for me to make my way.

They disappeared into the crowd as I finally came face to face with Gehi.

“Master Gehi!” I called out, and her ear barely twitched in response. “None of our medicines are working!”

“Lank… You were right…” Gehi whispered before I could speak anymore, barely audible over the noise within the House of Healing.

“What?”

“I was such a fool…” Gehi responded again, this time looking up to face me, and I gasped.

Her eyes were crusted up, almost sealed with gunk, and blood was leaking out of them as well. She held a soft rag that was covered with this gunk and stained with orange, having tried to clean her eyes out.

“This isn’t a plague…” Gehi admitted, crying blood, and lesions crying red visible on her tongue as she talked, causing her to slur her words and spittle red. “I can feel them, taste them, hear them. This isn’t a plague. You were right, Lank, we need the aid of the divine!”

Just then, the door to the House of Healing burst open, and in the doorway, I saw a figure, wearing a long robe, and holding an ornate staff, the head of which was a torch that was alight with flame. He looked about the room before walking in, and touching the shoulder of the Venlil grinding his face against the stone beam of the doorway with his free hand, and began chanting sacred words in the ancient language of Irinul, the Ancient Tongue of Solgalick’s First Disciples.

“Klol amli swa fuurn. Kle sa vath, yanat mae toolthu oarn, Solgalick yanayda gefank jaljati sa fuurn vath, hanaytra!”

**Memory transcription subject: Tarva, Princess of Hartekmoul**

I cowered from the spot where I looked down on the city from the balconey, body close to the ground. Many people were running around the town in a panic, many were pulling their fur out, others stood despondent, or lied prone on the street, yet still others tried in vain to rein in the fear. My eyes were focused on a group of wailing and weeping females, dark horns were curling out of their skin.

“Princess Tarva!” I quickly turned around and saw the Master of the Royal Guard, Kam in his full bronze armor, approaching flanked by Mommy, her dress flowing as they walked briskly. “What are you doing here?”

“You’re supposed to be in your room!” Mommy gently scolded me, before kneeling down and cupping my face in her hands.

“I heard the crying, and I tried to see if there was someone who needed a friend,” I honestly cried, looking up. “But it’s the people! The people are dying, just like Father! How are we going to help them, Mommy?”

Mommy hugged me, enveloping me in the vast flowing embrace of her dress’s sleeves.

“Father isn’t dying, he’s going to be okay,” her comforting words breaking through the din of suffering outside. “He’s going to be okay, the priests are doing everything they can.”

Just then, another, far heavier set of steps followed, and Mom got up, allowing me to see the King walk in!

“Father!” I cried out, running to him. Hugging his legs, which were encased in that super awesome bronze metal he’s so interested in.

“Ooh, precious one,” he grunted, gently pushing me away as the Generals walked past us. “I love you, too, but I’m sore at the moment.”

Suddenly, I was picked up from my armpits, and my brother lifted me from the ground.

“Hartek! No fair!” I whined as Father walked up to the balcony, flanked by two priests, who gathered in their hands sacred dust, before they clapped, causing a burst of golden flame to spread in the sky for a moment. The head priest then gently struck the butt of his staff against the stone floor of the balcony, and for several unreal moments, the crying stopped. I shook myself from my brother’s arms and rushed over to the edge.

They’re all healed! But h-

“Tarva, get back here!” Hartek scolded me, and I returned by his side to watch my father make his speech, flanked by the priests and Generals.

“People of Sinsodam! Of the Nation of Hartek, and all those beyond! Hear my plea!”

“I, Parkum II, the King of Hartekmoul by the blessing of Solgalick himself, am the guide and protector of all who live beneath the Banner of the Preserver! My every interest and desire has been for the safety, future, and happiness of my people and all Venlilkind. I speak these words to Sinsodam, and every Venlil domain beyond, an earnest wish. We must rid ourselves of the baseness and iniquities that have sullied our spirits, that have turned our eyes small and greedy, and caused great discord and confusion among all Venlil!”

“I have come to concordance with the holy Ven, and they have gleaned into the true nature of the disaster. What we are suffering is not the punishment of the holy, or the wrath of the Humans, but the crime of a foe that we know the face of.”

“Let it be known by all that they who seize and persecute the holy Ven of Solgalick shall be treated as outlaws! All those who conspire to defile the innocence of the pup, they who would rob, deceive, break their oaths with, sieze and murder the innocent, under Solgalick’s light they are cursed and executed for their wickedness! Damnation be upon the upside down ones, who take vice for virtue, and whose tongues are swords that cut and defile all who they speak to.”

“For too long has it been known how The Venlil of Gonim have embraced the wickedness that had consumed our ancestors, whilst we have done nothing to curb the darkness they spread! And now they have summoned forth a great herd of Demons to afflict us with every malady imaginable. They do this because they are our enemy, and always have been since before we knew they existed. They commit such heinous crimes against their fellow Venlil, because the Demons they worship demand they deliver suffering to those who refuse to worship them, and they do so with pleasure and not a single grain of remorse.”

“The Bearers of Disease come for us all! Striking down the farmer and the craftsven, the priest and the merchant, the criminal and the virtuous, the children and the parents, the lords and the sailors! They spare none! Their iniquities are beyond count, their malice boundless, and now, as they did then, they wage war upon women and children. But now, the darkness that they have taken as their light has given them a new weapon with which to inflict suffering with, the Evils of the Beyond!”

“Everyone remembers how in the past, the Gonimites have waged war against the innocent, and exerted astounding effort to erase from the land those Venlil countries who did not have the strength to oppose their vicious bloodlust and left their lands as ruins. They have multiplied suffering, championed blindness, and insult the sacred with their proudly debase and lawless nature, and now the Gonimites are doing so again! The people beyond the Kam Mountains to the East make the final war upon us! We must have their blood, for if we do not subjugate them and destroy their wicked shamans and sorcerers, they shall have ours!”

“What I ask of the sons of every Venlil country is not an easy labor, but a worthy one. No. I do not ask for you to become Hirelings, war is already upon us all, all the virtuous are besieged, and the Demons will not halt their assault when the leaves fall, the green grows, or even when the land is blanketed by snow! Only by Solgalick’s protection can their darkness be banished, and it can only be by the sword that it can be vanquished at its root.”

“Arise! I call upon all Venlil Nations to set aside the grievances and join Hartekmoul in truce to focus our might against those who infest the roads of our lands with robbers and attack the caravans day and night! I exhort you to cast out the ignobility of they who despoil our heritages by fraud and force, and unite against the Cupidity of those oppressors who name themselves our superiors and the criminals of our own lands alike. Let all who desire to continue our ancient feuds in this time of vulnerability be cursed.”

“Arise and return the days of war against the Gonimites’ lords and priests, who would see us and our lands annihilated! Summon your righteous fury, turn your weapons into fangs of fire to be wielded against the warriors who soak their hands in the blood of the most innocent! In the name of Solgalick! Arise and conquer the darkness and set ourselves free of Gonim!”

>the main protagonist describes it as a blessing and a course. a unique form of ""pure empathy"" that allows him to be an exceptional criminal profiler. This ability is often described as an ""empathy disorder"" in the series, but it functions more as a near-supernatural talent!



Lie to Me (2009) 100%

>Characters possess a natural, almost psychic ability to sense lies, see micro expressions and recognise patterns. Dr. Cal Lightman's ability to involuntarily ""feel"" others' hidden emotions reflects Pisces like crazy!

You (2018) 50/50 (depending upon the path the Pisces have chosen, lol)

>main guy embody a dark extreme of switching from fantasy to reality, building entire relationships in his head based on minimal information and convincing himself of a false, romanticized narrative that justifies his heinous actions. Has a profound understanding of humans behaviour to manipulate others. Sees himself as protector ho is rescuing his love interests from their flawed lives or bad friends. He genuinely believes he is the hero. When things go south, constantly denies responsibility for his actions, blaming his victims, their friends, or his past trauma, rather than acknowledging his own monstrosity. 


The Mentalist (2008) 100%

>the main protagonist possesses a near-supernatural talent for cold reading and observation, allowing him to act as an independent consultant by solving crimes using psychological manipulation and his hyper-awareness of body language and subtle cues!

Have u got any other recommendations? 
Might help others Pisces tv show enthusiasts out! 🗿

Laid Off in Dubai — The Last 4 Days Have Been a Blur (Salesforce Consultant),"By Allah's decree, I got laid off this week in Dubai and it’s been… a strange mix of emotions. Shock at the suddenness, frustration at how it was handled, but also a weird sense of relief because deep down I knew I’d outgrown that environment.

The last 4 days have been a nonstop sprint:
• Processing the termination and wrapping my head around the reality
• Updating my CV from scratch, tailoring versions for Project Manager / Solution Architect / Functional Consultant roles
• Rewriting my cover letter to actually reflect my value
• Activating LinkedIn Premium, optimising my profile, and reaching out to my network
• Applying to roles every day — Salesforce, digital transformation, technical product ownership, etc.
• Trying to stay grounded while supporting my family and planning the next steps
• Making Dua for Allah to keep me calm and focused.

Surprisingly, I’m not as devastated as I expected. I feel… calm. Focused. Maybe the contentment is my brain protecting me, or maybe it’s clarity that I gave my best and it’s time for a better chapter.

If anyone here has been laid off in the UAE job market recently — especially in tech/consulting — would appreciate your insights, tips, and what worked for you. And if anyone in the Salesforce ecosystem has leads or advice, that would mean a lot.

Just trying to navigate this with dignity, discipline, and a lot of Faith. ",zeshan_ae,1pcyn59,dubai,03-12-2025,08:15:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/1pcyn59/laid_off_in_dubai_the_last_4_days_have_been_a/

hose of you managing 100+ relationships... what's your system for remembering personal details?,"I'm trying to understand how people actually track relationship context, not deal stages or last contacted, but the human stuff.

My situation:  
\~Industry: B2B services / consulting  
\~Team size: Solo / small team (2-5)  
\~Relationships managed: 100-300 active  
\~Current CRM: Hubspot  
\~Budget: Willing to pay for something that actually works

The problem I keep running into:  
\~My CRM is great for tracking deals, tasks, and emails. But it doesn't help me remember:  
\~Personal details (their kid's name, that they're training for a marathon)  
\~Who introduced me to whom (and who owes me an intro)  
\~Why I should reach out today vs next week  
\~Whether a relationship is actually healthy or just ""last contacted 3 days ago""

I end up with a mix of:  
\~Notes scattered in the CRM  
\~A separate spreadsheet for ""personal intel""  
\~Stuff that just lives in my head

Questions for you:  
\~How do you track personal details at scale? Custom fields? Notes? External system?  
\~Do you track ""relationship health"" beyond just last contact date?  
\~Anyone tracking introductions / social capital (who introduced you to whom)?

Not looking for ""just use HubSpot notes"" I've tried that. Looking for what actually works when you're managing 100+ relationships and want to keep them feeling personal.

Sarjapur belt update - what I actually saw at Nambiar D25 this weekend..,"too many dms on sarjapur side these days, so instead of replying one by one and missing half the people, i’ll just tell you what i actually saw this weekend.

was literally at nambiar d25 the whole time on saturday and sunday.. three buyers from my circle, wife also there… so i’ve basically seen every corner of the place. and honestly the first reality check is simple - most of whatever phase-2 pricing people saw earlier is gone. like properly gone. base has moved, and negotiation is hardly anything now… 100–200 /-types if at all..and demand felt very driven - could be swift city hype, pricing momentum, or people who were waiting finally taking calls. and location also plays a role… that e-city - whitefield -sarjapur triangle is just a sweet spot now..roughly 100-120 units moved in two days. you see a unit, go discuss for 10 mins, come back, somebody else has blocked it. that’s the ground truth..

a lot of people keep asking me about scarlet. sobha scarlet behind rga is a fine sobha product… beautiful finishing, predictable execution, the whole premium vibe. nothing negative to say about the project itself. but the price people are discussing is around 19k++ all inclusive. that’s just a different budget world. Nambiar was around 13,750–14,000 all inclusive till end of november. big jump. and honestly these two attract totally different buyers - sobha premium crowd vs nambiar township crowd with some amazing construction..

in between you also have birla evara, prestige city, adarsh tropica, mana vista… each for different budgets and different lifestyles. all valid depending on what someone wants.. but nothing i saw this weekend was moving like nambiar. the pace there was wild...

this whole belt is tightening quickly… e-city- whitefield- sarjapur/carmelaram is basically stitching into one zone now. metro long-term plan, so many schools around, hospitals coming up, swift city behind nambiar… this microbelt is not the same as what you see on old youtube videos.

if you want a straight, practical take on what actually fits your situation, just dm. i run Lakush consulting, so i usually guide families properly once i understand their budget and lifestyle/their needs..

Genuinely terrified my husband won’t get a job,"My husband worked for approximately three years in the cybersecurity field in Europe before moving to the U.S. permanently with a green card where he is almost done with an MBA.  Ever since he got his work authorization he’s done absolutely everything known to man to try to get a job - painstakingly created resumes and cover letters and tailored them to the jobs he is applying to, had them approved and edited by career services at his school, tailored his cover letter, reached out to his entire network several times over, asked for internal referrals for jobs, mass applied into the void that is online applying, tailored his LinkedIn, the whole nine yards. He’s casting a wide net across sales, consulting, and cybersecurity jobs. Everyone who we know thinks he’s great and the people in his fields say he’s a good candidate but absolutely everything is coming up empty. Career services at his school says he’s doing everything they would suggest he do. But he’s not even landing any interviews. This has been going on for approximately six months now. I’m scared out of my mind and feel hopeless, and I know he does too.

ISB essays matter way more than people think,"Posting this because ISB season has started and I’m already seeing people underestimate the essays/SOP part.

Quick intro so there’s context - 8 years of work ex across consulting, startups, investments, an MNC, and an MBA from IIM Bangalore. Last year I helped 3 applicants with their ISB essays + interviews.
All three got in.

This year I’m starting late, but still taking a very small number of people. Doing it freelance, nothing fancy. And yes - it’s paid (reasonably). Good work takes time, and I prefer working with people who are actually serious.

If you’re targeting ISB and want help with:
• essays that actually tell your story
• cleaning the SOP
• positioning your experience properly
• interview prep later

DM me.
Not running an agency. Not overcharging. Just doing honest, quality work.

And before someone comments - yes, I know this may look like self-promo. No problem. If even a few people benefit, it’s worth it.

Good luck to everyone applying. ISB rewards clarity and authenticity more than anything else.

I am applying again to companies in UK from my home country. Luckily I attended 1 interview where they were giving visa sponsorship but I was not successful. 

Given the current rules in UK are there any companies who are hiring international applicants and giving visa sponsorship? I worked as a Data analyst in UK higher education sector.

I would be grateful if anyone has any references or suggestions how to go about this?
Which consultancy firms or company I should be approaching for this ? Any advice is appreciated.

Jasmine Crockett knows she’s a bad pick for TX senate and can’t win this race. So why is she running? Out of pure selfishness.,"Mild crashout warning but it really just blows my mind that Crockett sits at the top of the most recent primary polls and is regarded as such a darling by the Resistlib types when she is doing so much damage to dems nationally by seeking to intentionally throw away a competitive senate seat all for the sake of building a platform for herself (Say what you will about how Blexas is dead, that’s no excuse to give up one of the only red senate seats in the 26 cycle that have even a small chance of flipping). Jasmine Crockett has already said that she’s seen the polling. She is looking at the same results as the rest of us and knows that running as such as politically toxic candidate would be guaranteed defeat. 

She doesn’t care. 

With her house seat gone, all she’s looking to do in this race is garner a higher national profile to maybe secure some party leadership position in the future with a heated general campaign similar to Beto in 2018 (who, unlike her, was genuinely trying to win and had an actual shot of doing so). I’ve seen a couple interviews where she talks about the possibility of running and it is so obvious that she doesn’t even have a concrete strategy or anything, just the standard uninspiring “Paxton dumb and I’m not dumb so I will win” consultant drivel (which you still lose to by a wide margin in head-to-head polls, genius). 

I cannot believe what I’m seeing. In an increasingly polarized political climate dominated by attack ads and reactionary outrage you could not invent a worse candidate for this moment. Zero appeal to independents. No real policy vision. Very low ceiling compared to someone like Talarico. Taking advantage of a nationalized election to shut out rising stars within your party that have the potential of expanding the map long term just so YOU can grow your presence to land a cushy pundit job after your house seat got nuked is easily one of the most selfish things I’ve ever seen in a modern congressional campaign. Does any other 21st century senate/house election even come close to this? Maybe some GOP tea party candidates. Is *this* how all the political junkies on the republican side felt back in 2010 watching their party’s voters shoot themselves in the foot? This is definitely NOT what I meant when I said I wanted a dem tea party.",Cold_Student,1pcue4y,AngryObservation,03-12-2025,04:13:52,https://i.redd.it/hgzmttvvzw4g1.jpeg
How to deal with denial of needing a transplant,"How do you deal with the denial that you need a transplant? I’ll start by explaining everything - when I was 10 I was diagnosed with a disease that is now classified as a cancer but when I was 10 it wasn’t. It was in my skin and lungs and was treated with chemo, chemo went well and everything went on but with breathing difficulties.

Then when I was 15, my breathing decreased- I ended up in hospital getting a lung biopsy and honestly not recalling a diagnosis. The same thing happened at 19 but this time with a diagnosis - non specific internstitual pneumonitis- basically I have scarring all of my lungs that will just continue to progressively get worse.

At 21 I was put on Mycophenolate and I’ve been on prednisone since 19. This was all going well 5 years ago I had lapband to gastric bypass surgery in the March then met my partner in the October.

Fast forward to January 2024 we wanted to start a family which meant coming off the medication as it causes birth defects, my respiratory function slowly started going down ( still stayed on prednisone since) and then in February this year we got the news we wanted - I was pregnant.

3 weeks after conception I noticed a change in breathing but persevered and with consultation with my obstetric Dr increased my prednisone - unfortunately my O2 stats went down into the high 60’s and after a short admission in May I was put on 24/7 oxygen due to bub pushing on lungs.

In August I agreed to come into hospital because my breathing was getting worse, my mobility going downhill more to the point I was only able to shower every second day just to conserve energy. I was in hospital until my daughter was born - she was born 7 weeks early due to my breathing but thankfully she is healthy and happy.

Whilst I was in hospital prior to her arrival 3 doctors came into my room to have a frank discussion with me, due to it being a planned caesarean if anything was to go “pear shaped” then there was a very really possibility that I would end up on ECMO in another hospital awaiting transplant a transplant had been discussed with me roughly 4 years prior but I was told by the doctor that I was “too healthy” to see him, I’d lost alot of weight and that significantly helped.

So hearing this was obviously overwhelming and what was meant to be a joyous day was met with fear from my family. Thankfully everything went perfectly, I was on high flow oxygen through out the Caesar and was in ICU for 24 hours for monitoring.

My daughter was in special care for 4 weeks learning what she didn’t in the womb. The 2 days after she came I ended up in hospital with a ruptured peptic ulcer caused by the prednisone while pregnant at the join of the gastric bypass - I needed emergency surgery and after being told only 4 weeks earlier that a caesarean was risky to be told this I was genuinely scared I was going to die. But again it went okay.

Since then my breathing which in between the caesarean and the ulcer felt like it was getting slightly better feels like it has plateaued- I’m linked in with pulmonary rehab and do a walking pad most days at home, I’m slowly weaning the prednisone ( doctor allows me to do this) and have also 3 weeks ago started back on then Mycophenolate but the damage has been done.

My respiratory Dr has written to the other hospital that is the leader in transplants and I’ve met with them twice now. They work off a stage assessment - there are 4 and after a phone call on Tuesday I am now at Stage 2 but I’m in denial.

I never expected wanting a family would cause this much damage, I’m in denial and mourning who I was even if I was only a little bit healthier and I’m mourning and in denial of the fact that lung transplants don’t always work - I could die on the table and if I don’t - transplanted lungs don’t last long. 

I have been speaking with a psychologist surrounding my daughters birth as there was trauma there - the conversation about ecmo, it took 29 hours to meet her and then everything feels as though it is just crumbling around me.

The only good thing that has happened this year has been my daughter and I know a lung transplants is the only way to ensure I am here for her while she is growing up but I’m still in denial about this and don’t know how to move past it.

I wonder if anyone else has had these feelings and if so how did you cope/ move past this? I know it is the only way moving forward and it scares me.

Add on the fact that my partner and I purchased our first home in August last year and I am likely going to be without an income when this does happen, causing even more stress to an already severely stressful situation.

Resigned a high pressure job rather than potentially not being regularized. Don’t know how I’ll recover,"I got hired by a company who does niche tech consulting because I thought it would be good for my career as an analyst which I applied for feeling that my old company would lay me off (they did). 

The last 2 months have been really hell that it caused me to start getting panic attacks and I was hyperventilating and crying while only barely completing a phase of this project . Still there needed to be some rework. I was sleeping 3 am and working on weekends for 3 straight weeks on a project with tools I’ve never had experience on and a domain I’ve never done and expected to deliver to clients who are higher up. 

I was getting signals that im probably not getting regularized and I decided to resign because I thought that I didn’t want that on my record but also because I no longer felt confident about being able to perform with this debilitating anxiety caused by this job.

I wanna get out soon because I need to recover from this experience but my confidence is so shot that I don’t know how my career will recover. I feel traumatized not just by this job but after almost 5 years in tech where I’ve gone thru two layoffs. I’m also sad because this is the first job I’ve made over 50k but less than six digits. I have about 2 years being technical. I don’t know where to go and if my next job will crush me again under a lot of expectations due to a higher salary (if I can even get there). I wanna get married in 2027 so I wanna at least have a livable wage.

A Cautionary Note for Anyone Looking at Online Startup ‘Projects’ (Sharing My Experience),"Hi everyone,

  
**Posting this to share a bit of my journey and, more importantly, to raise awareness for those exploring startup ideas online. No promotions, no links, no offers  just experience.**

A couple of years ago, I was laid off from my IT job after spending a long time in that field. I was at a stage where finding a role matching my experience and expectations wasn’t easy. After months of applications and rejections, I realised I needed to consider something different.

I spent a good amount of time researching various home-based and small-scale business ideas. Like many of you, I came across countless posts and ads promising “inbound customer support projects,” “non-voice form filling work,” “high-paying outsourced customer care,” and similar offers. They all looked tempting, especially when you’re anxious and jobless. But something always felt off.

During that phase, I connected with a few genuine mentors and experienced people in the Outsourcing, BPO space. With their guidance, and after doing my own due diligence, I eventually started a small virtual call-center setup from home focusing on straightforward telemarketing and lead-gen services for a few US-based businesses. It wasn’t glamorous, it wasn’t overnight, and it wasn’t “easy money.” It took patience, consistency, and learning. I’m still growing, and thankfully it has kept me stable since.

**The reason I’m writing this post is not to talk about my startup, but to warn those who might be in the same situation I once was. If you are currently unemployed, or confused, or desperately looking for a small startup idea  please be careful of scams disguised as “projects.”**

Some red flags I wish someone had explained to me earlier:

* Projects that ask for upfront fees 
* Fancy “inbound” or “backend process” promises 
* Agreements that look impressive but fall apart when you ask simple business questions.
* Emotional pressure tactics like “last slot,” “urgent onboarding,” or “Fix income guaranteed.”

If something sounds effortless and unusually rewarding, take a step back and verify everything. Talk to real people, not just sales reps or consultants . Understand what the client *actually does* and where the work truly comes from.

There *are* genuine opportunities out there, but there are also too many traps preying on people who are already struggling. If you’re in that phase, please don’t let desperation guide your decisions.

**I’m sharing this because I know how confusing and overwhelming it can be when you’re restarting your career or trying to stand on your feet again. If my post helps even one person avoid a bad decision, it’s worth it.**

Wishing strength and clarity to anyone currently navigating this path. Stay cautious, stay patient, and don’t lose hope.",Time_Syrup8797,1pcubd9,StartupsHelpStartups,03-12-2025,04:10:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/StartupsHelpStartups/comments/1pcubd9/a_cautionary_note_for_anyone_looking_at_online/
Lifestyle creep is real. Why does Fat fire feel so middle class now?,"Hi all, 
I’m a silent lurker on this group for a while. Have been fired for a couple of years now. 36F. Consult here and there in my space once in a while. Husband 37M runs his own business so very much his own hours. 2 Kids - 7 and 4. The home is quite FIRE-D. We can take vacations, set up day time events, spend time with kids all on our time, no questions asked. 

Coming to the lifestyle:
1. We live in a penthouse - owned. Nicely done up recently. 5 bed rooms, a lovely terrace ya da ya da 
2. We own multiple cars - luxury when needed (think E class merc), Innova top model for travels, baleno for kids, a cute 20 lac car because we liked the color 
3. Full time cook, full time nanny, full time driver, full time top help 
4. 4 vacations - 2 with kids, 1 couple, 1 with respective friends, can add any others when needed - with family, with grand parents etc. The 4 are usually outside the country - business class, mid five star or luxury five star, private transport etc. 
5. Kids go to one of the top schools in the city, can take up and do take up any extra curricular activity they want. Have a fancy birthday party every year - play area/five star hotel. Give and get gifts which average 5-7k for reference
6. Designer bags (2/3 a year), shoes, watches, diamonds, nice bespoke clothing - Indian designer usually. Don’t remember the last time we had a shopping budget - maybe tends to 50k a month beyond the big stuff. Skin care, hair style, nails etc. 

Don’t know what else to add but you get the idea. Haven’t put a cost to it till recently. 

But the number is slightly higher than 1 cr if I have to do the math. 

WHICH TO ME IS CRAZY. I watch all those reels on needing 50 crs to fire in Metros and laugh at them. But how true are they. 

If I have to describe my lifestyle i call it upper middle class in a heart beat. And the best part to me is just being free from hustle, tension, spending time with kids etc. 
But am I getting it wrong? Is this upper middle class? I personally know a lot of people whose lifestyles look a lot fancier than me. Are they spending 2-4 cr year on year. Just my musings.

Guidance during a divorce,"My STBXH initiated a divorce about a year ago. He was back and forth about it for half a year following the initiation, finally decided to move forward with it this summer. I initiated the separation since he kept telling me he wants a divorce but wasn’t doing anything about it.

I’ve consulted my tarot cards and my pendulum. Is there any other rituals or spells that can give me insight on his actual feelings and intentions without crossing ethics and going behind his back?

I still feel like he’s back and forth and just picked what he thinks is easiest. I know that who he is right now is not someone I want to be with, I like to think people change and grow once they’ve realized they made a mistake so I’m leaving space for that. I don't need a love spell or a cord cutting spell. I am curious if there's another means to get insight.",Beautiful-bom3,1pcual7,witchcraft,03-12-2025,04:09:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/1pcual7/guidance_during_a_divorce/

Chinese AI startup DeepSeek just [**released**](https://elinke1c.daily.therundown.ai/ss/c/u001.ZY5Y0CT8KZaZ1y9TVLsmf-Xx22_GfJopkt2oD7GOFXpg6J2_2Q4dVC6NFnuZNXj0i8tFgnFMzwQq0T2pn0dxuKoh5YM5jlOC0JUaxsXBkkkgOMvNTN3zUCVk4lKPcJtmmm5gQfF-sTk2aYMnsA4vWcNmZ5VSToSeO-TyxVW2SFD_ANbcPDjKgguHFIazsla7_jP_FNVjqzxxSQHLjwTFOSs1redSJfzeUNb_zurNVwFvarGNZCTYrf4hI5nOMtnx/4m3/K0qOpYunToOmB0Akh40sAA/h6/h001.3lriZdDN9f0kz1eBVv2gve9W-FpvF0mEJ_IUzt9Nn00) V3.2 and V3.2-Speciale, two reasoning models that perform on par with SOTA models like GPT-5 and Gemini 3 Pro — while cutting costs and staying accessible under an open-source license.

**The details:**

* V3.2 matches or nears GPT-5, 4.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 3 Pro on math, tool use, and coding tests, with the heavier Speciale surpassing them in several areas.
* The Speciale variant hit gold-medal scores at the 2025 International Math Olympiad and Informatics Olympiad, also placing No. 10 overall at IOI.
* V3.2 pricing comes in at $0.28 input / $0.42 output per 1M tokens, a fraction of Gemini 3 Pro ($2 / $12), GPT-5.1 ($1.25 / $10), and Sonnet 4.5 ($3 / $15).
* Both 685B parameter models ship under an MIT license, with weights available on Hugging Face for anyone to download.

**Why it matters:** DeepSeek’s R1 release rattled markets and sparked U.S. chip export control talk, and the V3.2 follow-up shows the Chinese lab isn’t a one-hit wonder — open-sourcing a model with frontier performance at a massive price cut. For U.S. labs charging premium API fees, the pressure to justify that gap just got a lot more intense.

# 🚨 OpenAI declares ‘code red’ to counter Google Gemini 3

* Sam Altman issued an internal memo declaring a “code red” to accelerate ChatGPT improvements after Gemini 3 beat the chatbot on benchmark tests and sent Google stock soaring to a record high.
* The urgent move forces the company to delay introducing other products like AI agents so employees can dedicate resources to fighting off competition from rival developers such as Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.5.
* OpenAI faces pressure to meet aggressive revenue goals of $200 billion by 2030 as prominent customers like Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff say they are ditching the platform for Google’s latest model.

# 🤖 Amazon unveils new AI chip to challenge Nvidia

* AWS formally launched the Trainium3 UltraServer, a system using 3 nanometer chips that provides four times the speed and memory of the previous generation while linking up to one million processors.
* This new hardware is 40 percent more energy efficient than prior models, helping customers like Anthropic significantly cut their inference costs when running demanding AI apps on the cloud provider’s platform.
* Amazon also teased Trainium4, a future product that supports Nvidia’s NVLink Fusion interconnect technology so its lower-cost server racks can interoperate with the GPUs that currently dominate major AI apps.

# 🍎 Apple AI chief steps down amid Siri struggles

* Apple AI chief John Giannandrea is stepping down to become an advisor until spring 2026, a move that happens as the tech giant struggles to get an AI-powered Siri back on track.
* Former Google Gemini veteran Amar Subramanya will serve as the new vice president of AI to oversee machine learning research and safety evaluation while answering to software SVP Craig Federighi.
* CEO Tim Cook confirmed the company expects to release an upgraded version of Siri next year, following news that Vision Pro leader Mike Rockwell was tapped to help lead the delayed project.

# LLMs won’t get us to AGI: Sustkever

Generative AI might need to grow out, not up.

Frontier model firms continue to scale their LLMs to new heights in the pursuit of artificial general intelligence that can do it all. But another one of the field’s leading scholars is questioning whether bigger is actually better.

On a podcast with Dwarkesh Patel last week, Ilya Sustkever, OpenAI co-founder and founder of Safe Superintelligence, called into question the validity of scaling laws, or the idea that developing larger and more powerful models inherently makes them better. Sutskever noted that in 2020, we moved from the “age of research” to the “age of scaling,” with the goal shifting from discovering new AI models to pure growth.

Though the bigger equals better mentality is a “very low-risk way” of investing resources, Sustkever said, some are starting to realize that scale isn’t everything. “It’s back to the age of research again, just with big computers,” he told Patel.

Sustkever isn’t the only one challenging the current frenzy around scaling large language models.

* Yann Lecun, Meta AI’s former chief scientist and one of the so-called godfathers of AI, said on the Big Technology podcast in May that large language models won’t be the way we achieve “human-level AI.”
* Benjamin Riley, founder of Cognitive Resonance, wrote in an essay published in The Verge last week that human thinking and language are two distinct things. “We use language to think, but that does not make language the same as thought,” Riley wrote.

The increased skepticism is coinciding with a growing interest in AI that better understands the world around us. In November, Dr. Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs released Marble, its first commercial world model project focused on “spatial intelligence.” Researchers at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence released their next-generation world model, PAN, last month. And robotics firm Physical Intelligence last week raised $600 million, valuing the startup at $5.6 billion.

The recent hype around robotics and world models signals that researchers and investors alike are looking beyond language models for the next advances in AI.

# DeepSeek’s new models rival OpenAI, Google

Chinese AI company DeepSeek unveiled two new models that it says perform comparably to top offerings from OpenAI and Google.

The first of the new models, DeepSeek-V3.2, outperformed OpenAI’s GPT-5 on several benchmarks, according to a [paper](https://elink983.thedeepview.co/ss/c/u001.8tm-lavloxZbk7LH_fkTGNvVHhdlGz2tg2vL4wl9XfJXA_6DHEDXu1-_T7Xm9hsvCMKjbsutOoHVUnkytGgOSK9bgLZMxYcHZXS-eIGxHXgSSEG9Z0SsGEUzo5QZ8apqx_3f24hZ589IbzIbGkpsHCQZmkugdXiBM6GejAPE-MLh3RQ0OtxzPKaH4U7T7jvBE4DND2-JVO-UVFSLPKQm6iT2nDP3cWwpZTPMi5bOKh-MFL0wfgnOxXe23S0lNBWK-LCBOnbRSlXB6E2GxUNR6Qkc8wtA7fZ5Rqvcmb6dW3uErcHfnvM0TzD3qpTP0q_U-B3RH7hb0Kqrho6AG1jzvJftu63FS-VY-FBbLz8XJrGIhskgLX4FbtRnxnM-ODulT_6aViLvBL5gWdaBzfkn8okLlC4VeSmEOO7j3VQr-kWjxcoD1TtdsITRhaRYgkR6wo66SNXFMyXP2U3vmozRDwbS8wGab34LHwNbI3kb6x5D1E8KEsHOSQy5gN0xevyBVoDW8uhj175wUJVmqrIjD7u4TQpSHr_2S_Ms7ZmqLqFQHomO1hfKf6SPzLkBYMPlvGYo0t6U4Y0slyz4mVZlIzlNl8EJhqf9oXAvQ-GOwO_FTQcilFgR2S5ovo4gqHvvwbFd9u-TPE-w8T0rDoKCI2GZEkHjrz4FNxoknkj9ftYZ0tYRtdPDuyHvcrzZL09smtNCf3tvMK6LQ92UmRkGJPUSz1oL1TG0p5PNMCOqUcBSbaTymVzABlBV-m71ex3-OxxNzeJMCPi0fVZ7qkvdx_7D9wvSHflDdqR5qFECzTH9xCHECuSnD72TiL5HWieM-6L1Px301PhyZDkHr_aHjB2QsY6eTZ9oSxlgtcoNhyW93c2b-i4jikhdt669RKKCiDSSCfxa-1hfdMJAUZ0God-hjehReO3WdTPsd8Wgbb5jxedBJTvkIlzkKlSUBc3zRpZFwd5KFGjjgm6Gue7ockXZQqgnm1wcCBNmevf-YN31F8nOayoi-RtU45tRnwMSWazvRNGcMAAijKvSllrcJAGxHQfUODLO9kYH_0oQUk7aK1UKHQLhzhNDfC9wbq1DFa-1h4BG9Cp9QB-0kRT9z8aXqlekklYnRqa_fb1gEqOmoNamxhlPRzXSWPK3faOmCoFgTVRq5RK7-2CNuEan8QTbYDd2uTQ5YwLCOHNE82-XLQJDJa9168MylrNJYCC2pRQaiu_hGFZhnXfwkG3I78aWe8ekfRRkKDw5XvE1not5NEW3nGu8OUXgmuuWRMdTbRGm_Z_3MMvpr8FO7hekkGPg5kO7eEELSrn9tjS9pgiKe3pv18pRd8CUdUvg4EHP5jTZeyawuD0rs1iXCsCw03AUt2kHMsVN8gDTzcCqxMVEUPwyW_PyGYlhOXrEqzYM0O0zAaL_hljJKDu284NdgR-yUH901dvU6zDgyHKt6P6y1kBlarl8C54RiEdfcyCO47k-E0F1LcJtL2hoQebzkFXRLA1QU1T5uBZ4G98ltFiQYTBpRS8C_-wJjILlPvoA2yXMqYlYvucfPiG1i1Ix9ySGCfszPj2sUTYy98Hd5pN0uAB-GVUEnYHZTx7i69EyyVcOSOA_YIkeD_ds4N49OGrUL6UBLUWiy_NSWYWeq3ouRPpMybMiB_GQGSIO8Q11cQjT3IAbWkjURLvSY4Sc5zL0g_dfBJLzQgpOadalyK1Gn-rpVPNSIhf-2DDe4-L8qlhiqS0Zbd9wkPyc4kkxnMYF_xq0soBWqGd_qvZuQFl0r1VmmLGztnAAKgawgO_8lDgfrCBgt5VdP67lY_rkOuKT-u5PzXzYypVvore6qSsJ5lIRQ6uSs973Wk49tuK6FA8MrgjAeXOwNiZ4vKl_pM52-iZY_39omZm2bf5QFcOor0HMoFMd7kAcVF6HI61f2IFmFOxc8RnaWA1upPCxCmJTvhCVHTaLdyxZD8IxVZullD_6634_i8GEKq9eqjel/4m3/XYcJZpHRT2ulPQdUKahM_g/h16/h001.Xu8BjoLZRw8X5pScBJmrkQQrOQSWG3_xf2fz32h-lzA) published by DeepSeek. Its second new model, DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale, performs comparably to Google’s Gemini 3.0, DeepSeek said. DeepSeek’s newest models continue the firm’s modus operandi for efficiency. The new models can process the equivalent of a 300-page book at 70% less inference cost than DeepSeek’s previous model, according to VentureBeat.

This efficiency is enabled by DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), a new piece of infrastructure that scales attention mechanisms (the means by which AI understands context). Unlike traditional attention mechanisms, which can exponentially increase computational complexity as sequence length increases, DSA uses only the most relevant context, leading to significant gains in computational efficiency. V3.2-Speciale does lag behind Gemini 3.0 in token efficiency, DeepSeek noted.

DeepSeek made waves across the tech world when it debuted its R1 reasoning model in January 2025. The model performed similarly to ChatGPT but was trained on inferior hardware and at a fraction of the cost. The release seemingly challenged conventional wisdom that growing demand for AI would create ever-higher demand for advanced chips, leading Nvidia to shed a record $589 billion in market capitalization in a single day. (The stock has since recovered.)

Adding to the intrigue, DeepSeek has released its models under the open-source MIT license, in contrast to AI giants like OpenAI and Google, whose models live in proprietary black boxes. With the new release, DeepSeek has once again proven its ability to produce models on par with its US competitors — despite US regulatory efforts to thwart Chinese AI advancement.

When DeepSeek unveiled its R1 model in January, a16z boss Marc Andreesen [called](https://elink983.thedeepview.co/ss/c/u001.7zYFXt5AA3Px2NyJbPz6hLzQlTQ0Q_xPbuIfjv5lqQdhEVJzFENOk96fNsuQLMTtTneU4E6eUTE9i26qCXVQf2YKFiiMdbbRWsBkcrKuGZBPbC2sI1u2-mpgFz_txkoIRTPGO8BSONaL-XS4Zy3Dj2NY1BLNoHgrhur7jxbeyfbzqAcUmDw0lVY1eaUs8zrFcb2GnGlpoMkOeCMC7uUEdcYErsA4chO4p5ohcakNVeeSG8CEXS-YYf4ePQiKhlpc7X_rtQVP-q90QJRNSmjeYA/4m3/XYcJZpHRT2ulPQdUKahM_g/h18/h001.oI90Hw7fHToV6aMqxugzsLmkJxHdqz2Q3u8tUayrnbE) it “AI’s Sputnik moment.” These impressive new models from DeepSeek only further the notion that, despite its first-mover advantage and access to cutting-edge chips, the US may have real AI competition in China. The high quality achieved by DeepSeek’s computationally efficient, open-source models may also further a noteworthy recent trend — US-based AI firms opting to build on Chinese models, which can be cheaper and of comparable quality to their American counterparts.

# US data centers to double over next 10 years

Power demand from data centers is projected to hit 106 gigawatts by 2035, according to a new report from BloombergNEF, a 36% increase from its previous estimate. Data centers [use](https://elink983.thedeepview.co/ss/c/u001.5sXVVvymMF6ZsL5-zBaSfABNV3SXC2nR-1ffnN8nMOd0o6nmWY8xkW9ukUK1Zn7uvEjdtML8mTO7CHrlrrM5g4h3YtyBERLJ9M8r8xMcyzxAGfcDkXdh4iDf3EaCYn8rvqFZfbXczSQ5dzD2W5zAYMYzTmyqqxB-rK-97dIlsBOjGb07AVNXWpFPPXHnHHYz3DGClBw6e1oK59b0zlumbGLforHIZ8Q3l3Ql5kAtHa3WKi9drcg6ZpFyXv3fs0RW6rgYxj3y0YNqoLvu2TgWYvVDZ7OlUHYqytIeqvMxaDVMTvl2gWyg9tf6TTStNBP_0TGjUxD8VpGmHuGcav7rKw/4m3/XYcJZpHRT2ulPQdUKahM_g/h22/h001.9xIQj0U2r8nsIaN0vRsKR__5EoxoHy48Hju4br-tZ_w) roughly 40 gigawatts today.

The AI industry’s massive growth has driven up demand for data centers that provide the computing power needed to run the software. The growing power demand from data centers is likely to create an “inflection point for US grids,” BloombergNEF [said](https://elink983.thedeepview.co/ss/c/u001.gKxW2KpP8aPe_QMyOQduog2k8DwIFDNKiMXwLpOhO2FMBMac_qQWzQy9d9_Utq8zZgsxzkG4gZ9hz2iYhvDJ_1y5-wSjH3HwexAg5J7hG4l0ECRZMqCI3VEBReKvlm5uFk-fKcHJlfsp-kmizqMJDNIY9Dz_wJWBPyZEUeuVrDirIODcZxrDOBeDgOqwpuvaR1A3Xu_EWb0RuNR67_-i7YJ6eAWuptKmnNJ529_-sq8RcqGC86LgvZTgQ0JcYK0NuvXm6xG1cGat27N7hEwU4M2_tzygydROmZB9XM8WJJlpicQltxJ5fiA1QUzHbK9u9hI7n_ay20W_lXJtpwARDw/4m3/XYcJZpHRT2ulPQdUKahM_g/h23/h001.Q0WYgHny39dr_XKFFK7IJgKO9Pfmh4YHSVpUb5aBhp0).

Big Tech continues to shell out seemingly unlimited CapEx on AI, and a sizable chunk of that spending is going toward the data centers to scale it and meet growing demand. Microsoft spent $11.1 billion on data center leases last quarter, accounting for 31% of its overall spending.

Interestingly, BloombergNEF’s data center demand estimate may be somewhat conservative. Deloitte [estimates](https://elink983.thedeepview.co/ss/c/u001.wZPohD0JH12EksCsbt8ZeBxYk5N1ZeKsErEsWIhXHkzuENvYSgM6S591FUQKctNWs81famI4IPrWogd4zGqzGyqsG3Bp0gKY85sVhdrrLbJDT_dgPeEMCvjIBc56vtq-jOD6Ejwof8YtMZQMJG6_Gq7bWxsQAFAdvtdBtMgRUS8CFpjB09KYO2H9irvBJBGUACeBf4U_HFsFKyw0YxbJcgYJwlRxZoxiwS2cE2eK6V_3v6wqcNMoxHz0MVKkdlNicnNLt7gD4pZTJ-oxL7OFIIVx07wN9EJrHr2H6bc70mI60jW6qIVu71ChEe8JTSXFFXgePtW3eRRYa8YzPq1Zavn7S3fxQ7aI1jPOBtiA0MQa727EJ8WCi2-Q0VmXrkkc/4m3/XYcJZpHRT2ulPQdUKahM_g/h24/h001.T7vEnzDBoTH3c7OqUiyz2-PoOVrpS8LTF9c9FR6upSQ) data center demand would hit 176 GW by 2035, and Goldman Sachs [projects](https://elink983.thedeepview.co/ss/c/u001.wZPohD0JH12EksCsbt8ZeFjPmwnipNQSlJOwlvJm51iskWyjRvlpCWYJ9-F3Vkx64l_d9aOBoRilvy8I1wMYKuljCabjR8eSjwbDlNyMek8PT3PkhBabEUw48HVaPXpihDZGs2jmWJDyrkQiY8Hf8pC2ymFYE3grzEN0n8Ihya9QbGq44C-EUvccln49LkATCNhV2M_O_MSe1_2U7VLgJoaeScSfpJ1VY8fFBfY6L4rvIklG3IOBCHONWX4fZMwUPYfLPo-mwEwjetbp2t7NMX_e0Uh1Yt4fIWWm9o4FgAY1ZZJBN1zeDeLLBjS_Ctd9So2r1Oo0wRFmK_KQyXtfsUc8lpvLRumaUbyBzXv0mpo/4m3/XYcJZpHRT2ulPQdUKahM_g/h25/h001.iA3wgGcJvT7k2xwLV8qvwWpp_FN_DAv3yfjkMuURC68) data center demand to reach 92 GW by 2027 — a far higher growth rate than in BloombergNEF’s projection.

Growing demand is shifting the geography of data centers. As northern Virginia — historically the dominant region for data centers — becomes saturated, new projects are cropping up in southern and central Virginia, and data center projects in Georgia are moving further from Atlanta, the report notes. In Texas, former bitcoin mining sites are being repurposed for AI.

Energy grid capacity qualms aside, this report looks bullish for AI. The AI industry needs to grow rapidly to justify the accelerating capex and frothy valuations of AI companies. If data center demand truly does grow as quickly as BloombergNEF estimates, perhaps AI can keep the bubble from bursting. But if smaller models become more prevalent and more efficient models like the new ones from DeepSeek disrupt the industry, it could undermine the need for data centers and result in a glut of capacity — something that seems unimaginable in the current environment.

# Sundar Pichai says Google will start building data centers in space, powered by the sun, in 2027

**Ai powered by free energy will replace humans everywhere.**

* Google unveiled Project Suncatcher earlier this month.
* It aims to reduce AI’s environmental impact by relocating data centers in space, powered by the sun.
* Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company plans to begin sending ‘machines’ to space next year.

The great AI space race has begun.

**The details:**

* 4.5 moves to the top spot of Artificial Analysis’ Text-to-Video leaderboard, after gaining hype under the codename “Whisper Thunder” in testing.
* Runway says Gen-4.5 handles physics, fluid dynamics, and human movement more naturally, with details like hair and fabric staying consistent across frames.
* 4.5 can handle a range of styles, but excels in cinematic/realism visuals — with Runway saying outputs are “indistinguishable from real-world footage”.
* The model was also codenamed ‘David’, with co-founder Cristobal Valenzuela [**comparing**](https://elinke1c.daily.therundown.ai/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1HUCEDy5HGDmB74RLzTPPC1rZMuquM1sEp-kkahHJGvxrt7Zdr6NmVfHZL5RpKotlImo8EksiYEAngV6VeFUlaEJ9dqTgL0H9quZa-pIvzHsqtlzuGz1hvq6TOPXB2VwsU4z5eWZ8IRPi-b_YWFt56YWMaA8_wQ_W2nzyxWQ6z9hv_CHpt4KMhbRKg8PtTaDfFdBrVfk9YTKi1k7qaGN_G9pZ6IKDcWYU2fMgQ_K4gQ2HTCVeFPEcccNmuxFmbH0zog/4m3/K0qOpYunToOmB0Akh40sAA/h12/h001.kOkch-b8ZEL5Ph-megqxJPjW57akJuLCHXqnJ7ByXPg) the small company’s ranking to a ‘David vs. Goliath’ victory.

**Why it matters:** Runway has already pushed AI into professional creative workflows, and 4.5 feels the closest yet to the cinematic capabilities needed to be widely adopted across Hollywood. While the next frontier is longer generations and even better audio/speaking sync, the year-over-year improvement in AI video is mind-blowing.

**The details:**

* O1 accepts up to seven inputs at once, capable of interpreting images, videos, subjects, and text — with outputs of 3-10 seconds.
* Users can edit existing footage with text commands like “remove bystanders” or “shift to nighttime” while preserving characters and scenes.
* Other features include image, element, action, camera movement, and video references, start and end frames, multi-subject capabilities, and more.
* Kling’s internal tests show the model winning against Google Veo 3.1 and Runway’s Aleph on video reference and editing tasks.

**Why it matters:** Between Runway and Kling, December is kicking off with some massive AI video upgrades. O1’s all-in-one and edit-anything capabilities (similar to Runway’s [**previous**](https://elinke1c.daily.therundown.ai/ss/c/u001.dSnm3kaGd0BkNqLYPjeMf75St_4h4uVDlb2B1USeB_FqW0lhT46C2n7ZUJSa4dDlebrZjaQdYw79bEnodz75Qa1d998JimCuD0o4rp0QUiYeRxZ9RJnR2L_vQtNz4rLWHy6PHxUMQbsiI-eOvVscnYRa-H6_b7dN3Dk26N8_7KqyAYpB_fhGGTpBiOQOVy36YfG4SMDPJaFC4b5hNoXfERm0JRKg7zRPd9rrZbw-cQyaOMbJ2lxp2R4slSfMdymCr4VBQQCRhkXUO-CsA4h8_77MW0bOSHtXqQT1P20zSydJsMDi2vTuP4HX75urWaievvqpO4Cn5kM197N_xgqVhLPnF_7HB_s27ORxipg4gPw54jmU4bNNjZycI0utIWz9r1YBtEfE7fw2gL7vP9RitH_nBnbMqL3Dg9Zvi_PARlCAsiJJucmTUgPqnhaCtmk4loLw2NWWds5-0nbooq34F7SLXcTe8AEZk-biZxUyx_wdBvSPV-qBawNl4Gr_l70mN10_0VvcyXzgnTWhq6oxlM8zFfYW2fY0zjZh7SsXQGNIUXrqpJL-AqRkLoMGdIssT1SK9DRU8cqwf4LISqVPrWryJzMFbxYEZadGu0pQV7xquEPjZz219-Bka-0zEuLR1tt4Ds4nyOjAHPgAp0AkJcDdDEhw2Ycynm17EjvhUzM1SfQ5ss3i2zzpOzHzHeKSx-IuHB5pvQW2FHxnShGGhqjC9wbzCqtIy8I6a0kHk5cpYOA6rz1IfayaPcrbAQRK4HJHfR1nZU6DkRBusrIzdeLSacMziu4tsa-55l6DUW15kjeAvntxMA-SDcKzbIj2rG_Df8DjXEVbEtcisYkpcw/4m3/K0qOpYunToOmB0Akh40sAA/h21/h001.q27J62n_s2xkXGp-SfSnTxjtg8YqN0RbVo8P6HN5EXw) Aleph drop) are making granular edits to video possible like never before — a leap much like what Nano Banana brought to images earlier this year.

* Claude Code ships as a Bun executable to millions of users. If Bun breaks, Claude breaks.
* Bun stays open source, MIT licensed, same team, same roadmap.
* Anthropic didn’t invest. they acquired. Vertical integration for ai tooling just started.

What to do for guidance during a divorce,"My STBXH initiated a divorce about a year ago. He was back and forth about it for half a year following the initiation, finally decided to move forward with it this summer. I initiated the separation since he kept telling me he wants a divorce but wasn’t doing anything about it. 

I’ve consulted my tarot cards and my pendulum. Is there any other rituals or spells that can give me insight on his actual feelings and intentions without crossing ethics and going behind his back? 

I still feel like he’s back and forth and just picked what he thinks is easiest. I know that who he is right now is not someone I want to be with, I like to think people change and grow once they’ve realized they made a mistake so I’m leaving space for that. I don't need a love spell or a cord cutting spell. I am curious if there's another means to get insight.

"3+ years BDR at SAP ERP partner — stuck on plateau. Best paths to CSM, AE, or Solution Advisor in Canada?","Looking for advice from people in the Canadian (especially Montreal/Quebec) tech sales market who’ve successfully moved out of long-term BDR roles.

I’ve been a BDR for 3+ years at a large SAP ERP partner. I’ve worked mostly with CFOs, controllers, and ops leaders. My role goes beyond prospecting — I regularly:
	•	Join discovery calls
	•	Prepare pre-qualification & scoping notes
	•	Support onboarding conversations
	•	Work closely with consultants on handoffs & solution context

Despite solid performance, internal mobility is extremely limited, and most BDRs here leave within 6–12 months. I feel I’ve hit a career plateau, not a skill ceiling.

I’ve applied externally (including SAP), but:
	•	Associate/mid roles don’t open often
	•	Senior roles are understandably a stretch

Would love insight on:
	1.	If you went from BDR → CSM / AE / Solution Advisor / Consultant in Canada:
	•	What was your real bridge role?
	•	What skills or experience actually unlocked the move?
	2.	Which Canadian employers are true “career accelerators”?
	•	SaaS, fintech, ERP, RevOps — who actually promotes internally in this market?
	3.	If you stayed a BDR 2–3+ years, did it help or hurt your long-term path?

Not trying to skip levels, just trying to align my real responsibilities with a real growth path and avoid getting boxed into BDR long-term.

Appreciate any insight, especially from people who’ve made this jump in Canada.",Intelligent-Roll4259,1pcu6wz,techsales,03-12-2025,04:03:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsales/comments/1pcu6wz/3_years_bdr_at_sap_erp_partner_stuck_on_plateau/

so dems lost the tennessee 7th district,"this district was a very safe republican district by 22 points last election, and every election since probably the 2000s. and in this special election democratic socialist aftyn behn... lost. by almost 9 points

thats obviously impressive relative to last election, and it shows a real tide for the democrats to ride. but its still a loss. dems cannot rely on the tide. they have to learn from this and always improve

obviously, the first thing every single centrist will say is ""clearly shes just too radical for tennessee. we need to moderate to win in these areas"". thats a terrible idea. moderating shows lack of conviction, shows you care more about power than about improving lives, and skewers your narrative. moderating should be a last ditch and only done where absouletely necessary and done in a way that avoids fucking up your story

knowing fuck all about tennessee politics and how tennessee democrats are doing on the ground or what theyre doing, im guessing the real problem they face is lack of infrastructure. looking at previous results, and how tennessee dems have done, the pattern you can clearly see in every election is decline. even during good dem years, tennessee is going more red. that trend demonstrates the basic fact that the dems completely abandoned this state, and that has left state and local dems on their own to either figure out new strategies or, more likely, to completely fall asleep and slowly decline

and now suddenly, theyre given this election with a potential chance to win, and all the pressure to perform, and they have none of the infrastructure to accommodate and exploit this opportunity. theyre going to struggle

if we want to win in these areas, we need to exist in these areas. local dems need to become far more involved in their communities. they need to establish good relations, use the tide to encourage membership, encourage involvement

georgia is the perfect example of this. that state went from mostly safe red to competitive blue almost entirely due to local organizing building strong infrastructure for good candidates to capitalize

if you want to win, you need to organize in your community. you need to become involved. seriously involved. you should spend time doing all sorts of normal events and efforts in your community and encourage others to do the same, and you should get involved in your local democratic party meetings and events

conservatives wants everyone to be connected to the internet. their entire strategy revolves around it. most of their staffers now are terminally online fat groypers whos whole job is sitting behind desks and saying shit on the internet. now more than ever, going outside and being in your local community matters

(and if youre saying ""some groypers arent like that. they could be very effective on the ground"". just fire all the democratic consultants and force them into the republican party. now the groypers have to fight consultants constantly telling them useless bullshit and creating dumb polls)",YoureADissapointment,1pcu49r,jstlk,03-12-2025,04:00:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/jstlk/comments/1pcu49r/so_dems_lost_the_tennessee_7th_district/

Please Help me find a way out. (Long post Alert)..,"You can laugh after reading all that.
I know I'm a absolute Failure. A Clown also..I just don't know what to do.

I am 21 years old, and I feel completely lost and confused about my education and career path. I am a Class 10 passout. I had originally failed, but due to COVID I was passed. I was never strong in studies. I had no interest or motivation to continue 11/12. I just forced myself to continue, but I failed both years, which I had already expected.

My parents then enrolled me in a private vocational institute (I won’t mention the name). They genuinely believed it would give me practical training and real job opportunities. It was a two-year Technician level Certificate course (₹1.20 lakh). Normally, such courses are around one year and much cheaper, but this institute charged a high amount. My parents trusted it because someone in our family (some distant uncle) had studied there decades ago and got a good job, and the institute is also more than 100 years old. So they trusted it.

But, the institute turned out to be a scam. There were no proper Practical Equipment, no experienced teachers, no real technical training, and no good placements. Despite doing a technician-level course, they only offered sales and marketing jobs. For placement, they used outside consultancies that sent students to out-of-state, low-level jobs. The only jobs offered were ₹5,000–₹8,000 per month labour-type roles that didn’t require any education at all. They also claimed their certificate was “government certified,” but it was just an NSDC certificate and not AICTE certified—basically a useless paper in my hand.

After this, I started thinking about doing a proper B.Tech because it has better job opportunities and leads to a stable technical career. But the only way to reach B.Tech is by completing Class 12. I don't want to give JEE or WBJEE (I don’t want to give these exams because I don’t want to waste more years preparing).
 My only route to B.Tech would be through management quota, which is extremely expensive and would require taking a loan (but I’m okay to take this risk; I don’t want to waste my parents money anymore).

My other plan was to prepare Class 10-level mathematics and appear for JEXPO. But now, since JEXPO has become merit-based, this option also seems almost closed. With my 37% in Class 10, I won’t get a government seat, and even admission in a good private polytechnic is Impossible. I am also afraid that another private college might turn out like the previous institute, and I cannot afford to repeat that mistake.

I am extremely weak in mathematics—even at the basic Class 10 level. If I try to complete Class 12 through NIOS, it will take at least two years, and I’m not confident i can complete it in 2 years.(Once you leave studies, it becomes extremely hard to catch up, especially in a subject you were never good at in the first place.)

I want to work in a proper sector a technical field where I can work earn real skills and build a stable future in that line. I don’t want to burden my parents anymore. I am willing to take an education loan, but I still don’t know which path is genuinely worth the money and time. With each day that passes, I feel like I’m wasting more time. As I grow older, the pressure and confusion keep increasing, and I just want to find a clear and stable direction.

Consulting career crossroads: stay on the path or pivot to independence?,"I’m looking for perspective from people who’ve faced this decision or seen colleagues navigate it.

Context (kept high-level for anonymity):
	•	Manager at a major consulting firm specializing in SAP in Europe
	•	Took a short stress leave earlier this year due to a toxic engagement. I’m back, stable, and working normally again.
	•	Since returning, I’ve realised the traditional consulting path — long hours, unpredictable clients, shifting scopes — no longer feels sustainable or energizing.
	•	At the same time, the idea of going independent is becoming increasingly attractive: more freedom, more control, and potentially better economics.

I’m trying to get an objective view of the trade-offs.

Questions for those who’ve been through this:
	1.	Does having taken stress leave in the past affect internal politics if you stay?
	2.	For those who went independent, how did you evaluate the real risks (bench time, client pipeline, admin, income variability)?
	3.	Is it smarter to time the transition around performance cycles, or does timing matter less in practice?
	4.	What’s the biggest mindset shift when moving from firm structure to full autonomy?
	5.	Any unexpected pitfalls you wish you’d considered before making the jump?

Surprised by the incompetence level of many partners,"I genuinely believe the partnership model has governance loopholes that does not only not reward the best, but actually rewards many unfavorable leaders/partners.

The usual consulting flaws exist across the board such as:

- being robotic
- structured to the point of losing the bigger picture
- task driven instead of goal driven let alone impact driven

But bigger flaws exist; partners are underpinning the potential of the practice!

Partners should be leaders, strategist and most importantly? Political navigators. Unfortunately consulting in actuality teaches you how to execute, not how to position yourself.

And no, office politics is minuscule compared to long term politics, what worked in country y does not work in country x yet most partners don’t understand that.

I can go on and on, some would agree, others would not. However, I would advise high potential talents to use consulting as a stepping stone instead of a career.

2-6 years MAX then pivote only under a real strategic leader, someone who’s a leader and talent cultivator that will help you grow and not use you as a task delivery machine.

Wish you all the best.

About me for credibility: young leader selected for multiple high potential programs selecting a handful of candidates across +16k applicants each. Worked in multiple industries across top companies and governments. Worked with global CEOs and g20 leaders before reaching 10 years of experience. And unfortunately got underwhelmed by how things actually are done in consulting.

Edit for clarity and minor fixes - still long way to go as this was a quick morning post.

Update: this post is an opinion and pieces of advice based off of a personal experience and multiple discussions with CEOs, chairmen, ministers, partners and ex partners. 

This is not an attack on the sector rather on the governance model that led to what consulting has become.

Competitive intelligence beyond price cuts and market share — what do you look for?,"Many Business Heads/CEOs I’ve worked with (especially in small to mid sized firms) think competitor benchmarking = price lists + distributor gossip + market share snapshots.

But in my experience the real signals of intent show up in a few different places:

**• Product architecture** — how categories/sub-categories evolve, SKU mix shifts, regional patterns, seasonality.  
**• Pricing logic** — hyperlocal willingness to pay vs “one master price across India”.  
**• Channel presence** — strength of offline distribution footprint vs D2C vs institutional B2B.  
**• Structural cost health** — promo spend, manpower leverage, channel incentives, not just EBITDA % on its own.  
**• People choices** — org design, hiring backgrounds, HR cost vs skill density.  
**• Supply engine** — captive capacity, project turnaround, backward integration, procurement capability, quality/safety culture.  
**• Innovation bets** — R&D vs licensing, how the company is placing its long-term bets.

I’ve tried building a structured lens around these instead of random datapoints and gossip.

Help with network optimization (first pass proposal),"I'm looking at a network of underperforming locations with excessive density. More than 1/2 lose money, mostly due to deliveries in retail products. Prevoiusly, everything happened in-store: now, 60% of delivery is done online. People are willing to drive futher for the other 40%. The client needs to exit some sites: if you exit and lose coverage, you'll lose a % of the 40% of transactions done in-store. I'm trying to get to a reasonable estimate of consolidation savings. It would be saved expenses - lost revenue. 

I have ""reasonable"" driving radius for each location, and the number of locations and distances for each of the other locations within that radius. What I'm trying to get to is a high-level assumption around the following for the portfolio, without going into a map:

Location A: driving radius 5 miles

Location B: 1.8 miles away

Location C: 2.3 miles away

Location D: 3.8 miles away

Given these location distances and the large sample size (over 1000), there should be a  directionally correct way to say (again, average) that the above location has a 44% overlap with B, 37% with C, 23% with D, and 68% with B/C/D. In this case, if I closed A, I'd lose 32% of my 40% of in-store revenue. But I don't know how to mathematically get to the % overlap. Ranking the portfolio by estimated % overlap is a great way to initially examine overly dense areas in detail.

The idea is that I can repesent, mathematically at a portfolio level, some sort of optimized future revenue stream based on consolidating overly dense networks, wiping out those operating expenses while still maintaining a high % of in-store sales.

Developed most of my skills in a niche industry,"I left consulting about two years ago and moved into a Sales Ops + Corporate Strategy hybrid role at a F500 in a super niche industry. It’s one of those companies where, unless you’ve worked there, it’s difficult to become “excited” at what we do — and the product isn’t very “sexy.”

Even though I’m not passionate about the product itself, I’ve grown a lot. I’ve done real P&L work, category analysis, deal desk/pricing projects, forecasting, and a lot of cross-functional strategy work. All very transferable.

My question to folks here: does coming from a niche/non-mainstream industry hurt you when applying for strategy, or any other roles in other industry?
The actual work I’m doing is very standard consulting/corp-strat stuff, but the industry is obscure. I’m worried recruiters just won’t “get” the context or won’t take the company seriously.

Anyone have experience moving from a niche F500 into more mainstream consulting/strategy roles? Did the niche background hold you back at all?

How do you evaluate profitability on fixed-fee vs. T&M projects?,"In fixed-fee engagements, the real margin is decided at scoping and gets eroded by small unrecognized changes. What worked for us was starting with a cost model by work package, explicit assumptions, a separate risk buffer, and clear change-control rules. We track contribution margin at project and workstream level, burn versus value delivered, and the seniority mix against the rate card. T&M looks simpler, but slippage comes from under-utilization, ad-hoc discounts, and the absence of an hours cap. We moved to transparent rate cards by level, an optional sprint cap, plus a utilization floor for key resources.

We saw better outcomes when we tied the sales pipeline, staffing, and financial plan in one place, so PMs could see early how allocation decisions hit margin and cash flow. For that we used Unit4 in a mid-size context: timesheets, estimate-at-completion, milestone billing, and revenue recognition were synchronized, which reduced month-end surprises. The decisive KPIs were margin by work package, variance vs. EAC, lead time for change-request approvals, and DSO by client.

For fixed-fee, what mechanisms do you use to protect margin without suffocating the team? For T&M, how do you prevent tacit discounting and control under/over-servicing?",AppropriateReach7854,1ozlbvg,consulting,17-11-2025,16:47:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1ozlbvg/how_do_you_evaluate_profitability_on_fixedfee_vs/
Is it normal that half of consulting is chasing people to do their tasks?,"Hey everyone,

  
I started consulting two months ago (it’s my first job), and even though I enjoy it, I’m getting really frustrated with one thing: it feels like half of my job is literally chasing partners to *do* what they’re supposed to do like fill in the Excel file, answer the poll, send inputs, respect deadlines, etc.

I feel like a school teacher constantly reminding people, and I worry I’m being annoying or rude by following up so much. I give clear instructions and deadlines, but nothing happens unless I chase… sometimes repeatedly. And I do find this boring and not very interesting, I would like to focus more on the project itself.

Is this normal in consulting or do you have any tips to get people to be more responsive or proactive in the first place?

How long to recover from burnout? How to optimize?,"tl;dr how do you optimize the time to recover from burnout faster??

I quit MBB in spring of 2024 after 3 years… I was burnt out and disappointed with life. My values were all messed up from being in the consulting world. My true passion is in the creative arts, and I actually was able to do some of that in my third year at MBB. Which probably contributed to me realizing I didn’t enjoy the life I had built. I took a few months off— willfully unemployed. Still was lacking creativity. Traveled a bit but mostly was in therapy. Had a few other personal events happen around the same time. By the end of 2024, I landed a new job that would relocate me to a city I always dreamed of living in with the best work life balance and manager I could ask for  

Now it’s a year later, and I’m still depressed. It could be that Im in a new city away from family, friends and my long distance partner. But I think it’s deeper. I have traveled. I have crossed some things off my bucket list. I’ve done at least one creative showcase. But nothing brings me joy. I don’t like making art anymore. But it’s been a part of me since I was a kid…. But I just can’t get myself to do anything. I barely care about my job. I have some exercise hobbies I do, but if I didn’t pay for the classes I probably wouldn’t go. I eat horribly.Even though I’m taking the exercise hobby classes, I’m not exercising enough. When I do something exciting or fun, the feeling doesn’t last. I am dull again the next day. This is clearly depression and anxiety from the stress of being in consulting… but I would like to skip ahead to the part where I am recovered.  
  
I fear I am still recovering from burnout. That this depression and anxiety is going to last a lot longer… I spent three years being excellent at MBB. I’m worried it will take 3 years to recover. 

In true consultant fashion, I want to know if anyone has found a way to speed up recovery from burnout?

Consultant Upskilling Advice,"Hi Everyone,

I was recently let go/laid off from my firm, along with a few other consultants. I worked for a tier 2 firm. I pivoted from tech sales to consulting and lacked some of the Excel and PowerPoint skills necessary to deliver quick turnaround times (Totally my fault). I am using tutoring from an Excel instructor to become more proficient in the meantime. I still need to find resources for PowerPoint and consulting skills. I love the consulting space and want to use my downtime to upskill and be more effective in my new consulting role. I have a few questions for you. Thanks!

My Questions:

1. Do any of you have any course recommendations or books that teach better consulting skills, like a bootcamp or some sort? I purchased ""The McKinsey Way"" and discovered this course by John Burress (Management Consulting Skills Mastery 2025). Are there any other courses or training programs that would be helpful or have helped you master the required skill set?
2. I am looking to improve my PowerPoint skills with 6 months of runway. I found another course by John Burress (Management Consulting Presentation Essential Training 2025), not sure if it's worth it or not. Do you have any online PowerPoint courses, books, or resources that would be beneficial for building my skill set to the level of a Senior Associate/Senior Consultant in 5-6 months?

Seller-Doer Model?,"I'm at the end of the line right now. I don't understand how prevalent this is in other consulting firms, but somehow I'm responsible for almost everything from beginning to end. I'm in an engineering consulting role in a fairly niche technical field where I'm well known in a small industry, my firm is considered to be a thought leader and I'm responsible for a small team of up to 3 people.

1. I do marketing activies, write articles, go to conferences, speak, present.
2. Attend sales pitch calls, write and lead proposals, negotiate T&Cs.
3. Win the work by leveraging project references and the company's reputation.
4. Do the admin paperwork to open a project and set it up.
5. PM the work - staff the project, or do the majority of the work myself.
6. While I'm busy on this project, I have to also handle interim calls and proposals from other opportunities that arrive since we like having more work to be more billable.
7. Sometimes we take on multiple projects at the same time, right now I count 6 - before we need to maintain a billable charge rate target, and we won't say no to another customer, even if it's time sensitive.
8. Work extra hours and attend calls and meetings in different timezones.
9. Jump from project to project and do damage control when a client asks for an update or has comments on a report because we are working on too many things at the same time.
10. Handle invoicing and approve billings.
11. Management peskers me when clients are late to pay - and sometimes I cannot give a shit because I'm working on other projects.
12. Close-out projects in our very complicated PM software, and then send requests for client feedback - good client feedback will be a KPI in my performance review.

Again, any of these tasks can happen while working on multiple projects or writing proposals because my industry and my team's capabilities are niche.

Is this normal?

Best way to get off a poorly managed project with a terrible client?,"Was substituted into a project to cover for a colleague that was summoned for jury duty back in July. In the same week that I was substituted in, the client responsible for leading the project had been fired(!) and was replaced with someone else within the organisation. 

We were meant to have finished by November but we’re still revising the work that we’ve been doing since I joined the project and also still have several phases of the project left to deliver. This is largely because the client has been incredibly disorganised and unresponsive - they haven’t been reviewing the work we’ve been doing within the timeframes we’ve asked them to nor have they aligned internally on what they’re trying to do with this project or how it’s implementation should look like. This has resulted in time being wasted during meetings reviewing content that should’ve been reviewed prior to this as well as discussing details for the implementation of the project which should’ve been agreed on before I joined. 

Since I’ve joined the project, I’ve been largely responsible for making slides for our weekly alignment meetings (which I’ve often had to remake given that the client regularly reschedules our meetings, sometimes at the last minute). Myself and my colleagues agreed that I would also rescope the project and manage our hours in line with the deliverables and timelines we were supposed to agree on going forward, but I haven’t been able to do that because we still haven’t agreed on what this should look like. 

This is my first time working with such a client on a project (I’m a junior consultant). I don’t feel as though I’m learning anything or contributing meaningfully and I can’t help but think the time I’ve been spending doing busy work that often achieves very little would be better spent on projects and proposals in the practise areas I’m interested in and have the skillset for.

Leaving Consulting for Industry,"I'll be giving notice to my small boutique system integrator firm leaving will be bittersweet.

I only lasted in consulting for just over two years. I'm moving back to an industry position which is where I started.

There are aspects of consulting that I really enjoy, but over the past few years I've written some thoughts about the insidious mentality as a consultant. Keep in mind I worked with a few clients over these years and only a few times on fixed fee projects nearly everything was T&M. I did mostly technical IT application software integration, data integration, manufacturing process integration, SQL work and time series analytics work.

1. Design by sign off:
I absolutely distain this attitude that many of my coworkers have. ""It's what the client wants *shrug shrug shrug* when it doesn't work I just tell the that they wanted it that way. Then bill the T&M to rebuild it. As a client you should ABSOLUTELY hold a consultant's ass to task if they give you this line. I only want you to put your hand on the stove unless you CLEARLY understand I told you not to do that, the consequences for doing it. Then and ONLY then should I let you burn your self. 

2. Never building things to anticipate need or future development throughput:
Part of this is client driven, but part of this is that the things that you up for success in the future rarely can be defined from a true ROI perspective. Time and time again I would see massive opportunity to improve client systems but the way you would have to do that is selling them on ""organizing their bullshit"" which none of them value. Then there was the other side of this that was not client oriented at all. Most of (not all) but most of the engineers I worked with simply did not give a shit if someone else saw their work because clients won't pay for ""internal product review"".

3. Something I call communication ski ball: This is both good and annoying, but truth be told no matter how many times you've communicated something as a consultant the ball is always rolling back to you. No matter how good your system of communication is to the client, the ball is always in your court. While at first this is annoying as fuck I think it's actually good mentality in the long run for actually producing something tangible and creating the all holy paper trail of evidence.

4. The time I say it took and how long it actually took are two different things entirely and never shall the two actually meet. Everyone is clueless for how long things actually take. This has two effects, first is the obfuscation of the work it self. When justifying the time for a particular task you start to become a master of making things sound like they take much longer or giving these tasks a level of sophistication. The charitable self delusion I have is that I invest in getting shit done faster or better where I would otherwise see no reward for getting it done faster my reward for that is going to be collected on the front end and not wait for one later. The insidious mentality here is most consultant do not have an incentive structure outside of being yelled at to improve the methodology of deployment.

5. When in doubt it's always the vendors fault. The amount of responsibility hand waving an integrator does back to the vendor should be studied as a MASTERCLASS in gas lighting. The excuses you have at your disposal here are near endless, the chief of which in my world is ""the documentation is BAD"". I can spare every client in the world some headache EVERY PIECE OF DOCUMENTATION IS BAD, that's why you hired someone. If the documentation spelled out exactly HOW to do the thing you wouldn't need us TO begin with. Another classic is just straight up pushing work we would do on to the vendor, this is a delicate balance because it is sometimes ENTIRELY justified and other times it's used as a tactic to make the vendor look bad and US the consultant look good.

This is my word salad and I'm sticking with it.

Compensation advice needed,"Hi all,

Used GPT to fix the grammar as my English language is not the best

I’m facing a challenging situation at my current job regarding compensation.

Our organization has six levels: BA, JC, C, SC, Manager, Director, and Partner. I joined at the C level. After a year and a half, I was promoted to a more senior role. Before the promotion and salary increase, I knew that some employees at the C level were earning slightly more than I was.

I had multiple discussions with management and, upon promotion, received a salary bump of around 34%. Nevertheless, I am currently the lowest-paid employee at the SC level, despite taking on more responsibility than most SCs. I manage projects and sold two opportunities this year. The pay gap isn’t minor—it ranges from 15% to 50% compared with peers at the same SC level and with similar years of experience. I’ve consistently been recognized as a top performer. I sold and delivered a major engagement last year, which led to the promotion.

Knowing this has been discouraging, the knowledge has transformed into bitterness and I’ve started exploring the market for alternatives. However, my current company is among the few that offer relatively high compensation compared to peers.

I understand that starting salary is a key factor, and I negotiated poorly three years ago. However, I want to correct the situation now. I’d like to approach this professionally. My line manager is very “of the company,” and having a reasonable compensation discussion with him is difficult. He often says we should be grateful and not make comparisons.
Last week, during my mid-year evaluation, I told him that for the next engagement I would like to return to a standard SC role and no longer serve as project manager. He said that would be impossible and that we shouldn’t discuss it further. Per our company guidelines, project management is not listed as an SC responsibility.

I frequently work directly with the Partner on engagements and was considering raising the topic with him. I’m unsure how to proceed, and I expect they may point to the 34% increase I already received. And i don’t want to push in a way that would a negative impact on my future status at the company

I know the best solution may be to move to another company, but I would like to try to fix my current situation.",Capable-Editor-7887,1orliy6,consulting,08-11-2025,09:50:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1orliy6/compensation_advice_needed/
Parallels: Windows on Mac. Consulting Utopia or Gimmick?,"Interested to hear opinions from those who have tried this in a real world, chaotic, client-facing environment.

And for those not familiar: Parallels is a piece of software that allows you to install and run a copy of Windows on your Mac (in layman’s terms). It means full Windows functionality (i.e. all your PPT add-ins), nicely wrapped and beautifully integrated with the everyday workings of a Mac.

I’ll go first:

I’ve been playing about with Windows on Apple products for about 6 months now. The genesis was an OS crash on my field-issue Lenovo X13 which caused untold back-tracking to fix a client report and huge delays. It’s a moment that had been ominously lurking in the shadows for some time, given my laptop’s propensity to just not do what I asked it to, or take 10 mins to eventually do so.

Enter Parallels. It promises a windows experience from the comfort of your Mac. And, by and large… it delivers!

Negatives out of the way first: 

1. You need a powerful Mac. There’s no getting around this. Because Parallels on Apple M chip devices is essentially a software programme like everything else, it typically needs the same amount of RAM as your Windows machine does… to run Windows. Problem is, your Mac also needs juice to run Parallels in the first place (as well as all your other programmes). Hence, older, less endowed M-series machines need not apply. I’m running an M4 MacBook with 16GB RAM and compromises have had to be made to ensure smooth running. You can forget HDR or 100hz refresh. Ideal minimum RAM should be 24GB. This will price out a lot of potential customers.

2. You need to pay $$$. This solution isn’t for the faint of wallet. Not content with forcing you to buy a grown up Mac, you need to pay for the Parallels Pro service to access a sufficiently endowed VM installation option ($100p/a), otherwise your 10,000 line, VBA Macro Excel will laugh at you. Then you need a standalone Microsoft license and access to Microsoft Office (another $100/a)

3. There’s still some Mac / Windows keyboard funkiness going on. It’s good, but not perfect. If you’re into shortcuts and hotkeys, there may be a compromise to make.

The good bits:

1. You get to use your Mac. This means:

- Seamless integration with your apple ecosystem
- (Mostly) seamless integration between your Windows files and your personal Mac stuff
- everything you enjoy about actually using your Mac - its keyboard, track-pad, screen clarity
- Battery life! OMG! My Mac will happily last a whole day of being dragged from meeting to meeting, sharing screens etc.
- Apple smoothness. This is a big one, your Mac just works. You turn it on, it immediately gets in to what you’re working on. No histeronics; no 3hr updates; no overheating and throttling (I’m looking directly at you, Yoga X13).

2. Windows works *better*.  This one is unfathomable to me. I’m using half the RAM of my laptop, I’m emulating various apps (instead of running them natively), and yet… it just works. Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook (the proper version) all work as if they were Apple apps. There’s no “programme not responding” or Task Manager negotiation. It just works. The only hiccup I’ve had is running an 80mb PPT proposal that started to get a little bit grumpy. One caveat: Emulated MS Teams and Chat GPT can be a bit laggy. Again, this appears to be a Mac hardware factor. If you’ve got the juice, it’ll work fine.

3. Huge weight saving:

- My personal favourite: IPad link. Some of you hardcore travellers might understand this one better. For anyone who carries a laptop extender in their go-bag to provide more screen real estate then your inbuilt 13” Betamax screen can provide, this facility is a game-changer in itself. I use my iPad for on the go presenting and note taking. It’s coming with me to site regardless (and then I use it for that 5 mins downtime before bed). To be able to use the IPad as a second screen with the MacBook (and run your Windows apps inside it) is absolutely incredible.  In typical Apple fashion, it is as slick as butter and allows me to get dual use out of my IPad and leverage the bigger, better screen of my Mac.

- No more bulky Jabra headset. Because my AirPods Pro (Gen 3 is just incredible) talk as nicely with the Mac as they do the IPhone, I can take Teams calls in noisy client environments and not have to constantly mute myself or apologise for background noise. They don’t talk as well to your laptop; hence you’re taking them on the plane to cancel the noise, but you’ve still got your headset round your neck like a doctor wears a stethoscope. No more! 

Ok now your turn.

	•	I know the systems and have credibility
Why I wanted out:
	•	I want to learn sales/BD, not just delivery work
	•	Manager is too overworked to develop me in that direction
	•	Market concerns (small firm, heavy AWS focus, professional services sensitivity)
	•	5 years is a long time

What I’m getting at the new place:
	•	Stability and legitimate comp (they didn’t need me to threaten leaving)
	•	Enterprise experience
	•	Better benefits package
	•	Hybrid schedule with reasonable commute

My gut says: 
If they were fine paying me $93k until I had one foot out the door, what makes me think this won’t happen again in 2 years? The new company valued me at $126k without the hostage negotiation.

Long-term goal is to start my own consultancy, so I’m torn - stay and maybe learn the business side (if they actually invest in developing me), or take the stable comp reset and enterprise experience?

[venting] working for a client who constantly changes the requirements is driving me insane,"I am doing software development work and we’re building this web app that needs to connect to an internal system. Right now it’s using “dummy data” and not connected to anything. The story I’ve been assigned is dependent on this connection being made, but the other developers don’t know how to establish this connection. They’ve been working on it for a week+. So I went ahead and setup the connection myself in an afternoon since my story depended on it. I got yelled at and told to ditch the code and just setup “scaffolding” for the connection. Since then I’ve had two other developers ask me why I did that and I just said I’m doing what I’m told. Now nobody else knows how to set this up and we’re just all twirling our thumbs. I want out so bad, but it’s fully remote and the local recruiters only offer me ugly manufacturing/defense contracting jobs that are onsite and pay less.

Consulting was the best job I ever had,"Just a point of comparison for all the young consultants fresh out of college at an MBB or Tier 2 with a structured program. You don't have to really think about life. Expense meals, get work thrown on your plate, you just have to show up and be smart and give the company your M-Th.

  
And then as I spent time in other careers (private equity, venture capital, hot startup) I have realized that risk really weighs on you as you age. And consulting is one of the most *existentially* risk-free jobs. Continuing to develop specialized skills that you can sell for work is one of the most secure practices of work you can pursue and honestly probably the most ""pure"" business model. As you sell more work than you can perform, you scale headcount. Having looked at buying white collar services businesses before in PE, as you enter in management, you buy and sell producers for a multiple of the revenue they produce. I wouldn't have to worry about my carry going to zero; these firms have existed for eons and will continue to survive and eventually pay solid bonuses and one day partnership units. 

  
The only downside is that you will never be fuck you rich but that is unfortunately, in my opinion, the product of not really having real risk. And then when you do decide one day you would like to take risk, there are lots of operational options. 

  
Also, the work is intellectually stimulating and the cultures are generally pretty good. Sales is fun and knowledge work is fun. Private equity was one of the least sexy jobs ever. Accounting and project management. VC was marketing and brand building to be able to worm your way into the consensus deals that every VC wants to get into. Much more ecosystem building and networking than intellectually stimulating. 



What I think this boils down to is risk tolerance. And for the risk averse that expect a certain quality of life, consulting (primarily MBB/T2) more or less promises you turnkey upper middle class if you simply perform. It's a comfortable life and candidly I regret leaving consulting after my first three years out of undergrad. I've had a variety of interesting experiences and pocketed more money than consulting would have allowed, but I'm in my early 30s and have gray patches on my beard from 1st chair deal work. 



My unsolicited .02 for anyone at MBB etc. is go for 5 years, get your sponsorship to bschool, and go right back and continue saving. Honestly the work is not that hard, you have weekends, you have little risk, and you are building a tangible skillset. If you reorient your mind to sales as early as possible, you can be a killer, just find a partner that will let you start to nurture a network early on. You'll quickly find out whether you have the commercial instinct for sales or not, and if not, whether you have the appetite to build one.

  
Posting this as I am knee deep in modeling the hairiest business ever and want to blow my brains out. Also yea I am talking out of my ass I haven't been in consulting for getting close to a decade but I sure as shit look back fondly on it.

How did you reinvent your brand?,"Hello fam,

I’ve spent quite a few years in management consulting at a large firm. I haven’t always been a consistent top performer… partly due to some personal challenges… and that’s okay. I’m not chasing a fast track to partner. :)

Recently, my practice lead left the firm, and I’ve lost some of the leadership support I used to rely on. As a result, it’s been harder to get staffed on exciting projects where I could learn and grow on the job.

My area of specialization has also lost some of its relevance for a few years, and I’m really struggling to reinvent myself.

A few years ago, I tried to pivot into Cloud, and it turned out to be more technical than I expected, and I couldn’t quite build credibility in that space. :(

Now, with everyone riding the AI wave, I’m willing to invest 50 to 75 hours to learn Python and (agentic) AI. Still, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m already far behind my peers.

Is anyone else facing a similar challenge? How did you go about reinventing yourself?",throwawayinfire,1onp9ng,consulting,03-11-2025,21:52:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1onp9ng/how_did_you_reinvent_your_brand/

Mid-career crossroad,"Hey everyone,

I’m at a bit of a fork in the road and would love some perspective from people who’ve been there.

I work at a an MBB, and I’m about a year away from my next promotion (roughly the EM/PL/M level). The promotion would mean a significant jump in pay, responsibility, and leadership exposure, basically the start of the “real” consulting career track.

Recently, I got an offer from a large, very stable corporate or institutional organization for a senior project management role in IT transformation. The total compensation is roughly 40 to 50 percent higher than what I make now, with excellent benefits and much saner hours (around 40 per week instead of the usual consulting grind). Benefits are also great (children education allowance, annual flights to home country)

The catch:
- The title is a step down from where I am and sits in a pretty hierarchical, tenure based system
- Promotions seem slow and politically driven
- Many people there appear content to coast rather than push
- That said, the immediate team and leadership seem strong and great to work with

If I stay, I’ll grind another year, likely hit the next level, and stay on a trajectory that could put me in senior leadership by my mid 30s, but with continuing stress and travel.
If I move, I gain financial comfort and work life balance now, but risk stalling long term momentum and brand equity.

I‘m a pretty impatient person and gets bored quickly. I also can‘t really tolerate incompetence, so my biggest worry is that I will actually feel more stressed out in the industry. Especially knowing that there is a lot of incompetent people holding higher titles simply because they‘ve worked longer.

Has anyone faced a similar decision, trading a near term promotion in consulting for a well paid but slower corporate role? How did it work out for you? Any regrets or insights in hindsight?

Unlikely to make “on-time” promo due to bad review 9 months prior,"Currently a junior associate (BA/ AC/ A) at one of the UK MBB offices - received a bad grade on an engagement earlier in the year due to burnout and some confidence issues. 

Took a break and have managed to turn my performance around in my new projects - LT are happy with my work and feel the remedial period is closed and I should be working at the next level. 

However, my on-time promo period is coming up and although LT have informed me they will recommend me for promotion, they think I am unlikely to get it due to my bad review from previous project. ""Promo committee will want to see more"" - is the exact phrasing. 

Obviously, this is difficult to hear. I've been working hard to turn this around and it seems I may still fail. There are a lot of emotions here, chiefly, shame at being unable to keep up and being left behind by my peers.  I had told myself that I would consider leaving the firm if I didn't get my promotion. And I guess, I have two questions here:

1. Not receiving your first step-up promotion feels like a death knell - I don't know whether choosing to stay and trying again in another 6 months is worth it or whether I'm delaying the inevitable. I'm not sure when resilience turns into stubborness. BUT, I would hate for my pride to stop me from doing what's best for myself. Is it worth staying if I didn't get the promotion or is it a mark against you?

2. This is silly, but, I got this job straight out of university - I've never applied to a job the traditional way and have no clue where to start/how to do so. My goals for my future career remain clear to me - I'd like to go to grad school to pivot into a more policy-focused arena. I just don't know what I should be doing to forge a new path if I chose to leave. 

Ultimately, this is causing me a lot of anxiety - I'm trying to push through and keep on giving it my all during working hours but I just feel like I need to do something to help alleviate the ""stuck"" feeling.

Fix bid support,"How often do you guys see fix bid support contracts in action?
What I’m really curious about is different ways of capping efforts under those kind of contracts. Do you just go through an identity scope tightly to make sure there is scope creep leading to much spent time or perhaps use some max hours at blended rate cap?

What we have been doing is simply using blended rate and divide the fix amount it by to arrive at baseline hours. We also added that if 3 months in a row the overage is above 15% then that forces a re-evaluation of the amount.

I feel like that even though this seems very thoughtful we are on the hook for 15% extra of unpaid effort and its a gimmick to just potentially do more work for less.

On the other hand if we get efficient and do things in 50% of the baseline we still get the full amount.

Partner promotion process and burnout,"I'm an AP right at the cusp of Partner, either this cycle or next cycle. I've been at the firm for 4 years (came in as an AP from industry), we've been acquired 2x, and I had to basically start over each time. It's ended up working out in terms of better pay, opportunities, firm reputation, etc. 

Apparently I am killing it even though I don't feel like it. I am making sales and owning client relationships. I am running multiple projects. I am writing white papers, creating new IP and offerings, and leading internal firm initiatives. I have gotten so, so close to where I want to be, but I am burned the fuck out and losing it mentally.

And that it should generally be easier as Partner because I'm basically doing two jobs right now.

Do I have imposter syndrome or am I just slow?,"I am in my first year in consulting and my new project is killing me. I’m starting to feel like I’m not cut out for the fast-paced nature and people management that comes with the job. The entire day is full of meetings with the same people changing their minds and then I have to update all the materials based on those meetings but it’s hard for me to keep track of what needs to be updated and what needs to be created without explicit guidance. My director has been calling out all the things I didn’t update yet or correctly and I feel like I’m failing. I also feel like I can hear the frustration in people’s voice when I ask them to repeat or clarify things, which reveals I’m not understanding something I should.

I report to a director and partner, so there is a huge gap in levels. I feel like even with past managers on other projects, I can hear the frustration in their voice when I would repeat something back and it would be incorrect or I would ask clarifying questions and it was clear I didn’t get it so I’m scared to ask questions to not make them frustrated. My last manager told me in my feedback he feels like he has to keep repeating himself and I am not comprehending what should be very clear and that’s why I internalize when I hear frustration in all my managers voice when I ask them to clarify.

I don’t know if I’m genuinely slow or I’m just not used to keeping up with the constant changes and knowing what to do without explicit guidance. Is this something everyone in consulting has experienced? My year-end performance review said I was meeting expectations, and my manager who I discuss my performance with for year-end even rated me as above expectations before I got knocked down.

Consultant at Oracle with RSUs but stagnant pay — stay or move?,"I (35M) have been working at Oracle as a consultant for the past 5 years. Over the last 3 years, there have been no salary hikes — though I’ve received a decent amount of RSUs, which have appreciated quite well.

However, I’m getting frustrated because my base pay hasn’t moved. I’ve been exploring external opportunities, but I recently realized that most companies don’t factor RSUs into CTC when making offers.

Currently, my market value (based on salary alone) is about 1.6x my current CTC, but most companies are only offering 30–40% hikes. If I include my RSUs, I’m more or less at market value already. To add to that, I hire juniors one level below me at around 1.3x my CTC, which makes the pay gap feel even more frustrating.

Recently, I got an offer from a Big 4 (Deloitte). The hiring manager mentioned that I have two possible tracks there:

1. Stay on the solutioning side (consulting/product expertise), or
2. Move to the sales/pre-sales side.

He said moving into sales/pre-sales is how I can get into the “big league” and make serious money in the long run. The thing is — I’m not really into sales, and this has made me rethink my next 5-year plan.

Here are the options I’m considering:

* **Stay at Oracle** for another couple of years while my RSUs vest. The work-life balance is good, and I get plenty of free time. May be I can upskill through certifications, AI tools, or product management courses.
* **Move to Deloitte** and stay on the solutioning/consulting side for broader exposure.
* **Move to Deloitte** and transition into sales/pre-sales for higher earning potential (even though I’m not sure I’ll enjoy it).
* **Transition into Product Management or Program Management**, something I’ve been thinking about, but not sure how feasible it is at this stage.

Would love to hear your thoughts — What would you do in my situation?

- I enjoy consulting more than data sales. I found the product boring, and gained more skills working at big 4 than at my previous employer

- The data sales company is a big company known worldwide. Whereas the boutique consulting is a small 20 people shop with 2 partners.

The paycheck era is dying and I think wages are about to drop faster than anyone expects,"  
I’ve been thinking a lot about where income is headed as automation keeps stripping out repetitive work. Right now, wages make up +/-  60% of total household income.

I don’t think that number will hold. Within the next decade, I see it dropping closer to 30–35%.

Not because people suddenly get lazy.. because the system itself is shifting.

We’re moving from a time-based economy to a proof-based economy.

In other words: you won’t get paid for *showing up* anymore, you’ll get paid for *producing visible results* or *owning leverage* (things like systems, IP, or distribution).

Consultants are already living in that model: money for results, not hours. (Hopefully you are...)

But I think that structure is going to expand far beyond consulting.

The rest of the workforce will probably split into two paths: Those subsidized by governments (UBI-lite, benefits, etc) and those forced into performance economies like freelancing, advisory work, small partnerships, micro-entrepreneurship.

That middle ground between stability and autonomy is evaporating fast.

* Do promotions usually happen *as part of* regular performance reviews?
* Or is the process handled **separately**, e.g., a specific review or decision happening *before* or *after* the standard reviews?
* If the review is in January, is it common for a promotion to be *effective immediately*, or is there usually a **lag (e.g. March, April)**?

Would love to hear how it works at MBB, Tier-2s, or boutiques.

Thanks in advance!",Lostingoogle,1obn3zu,consulting,20-10-2025,16:33:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1obn3zu/promotion_timing/
Can I still be dedicated to climbing while being an associate at McK,"Recently got my offer at McK, starting in about a year after finishing my PhD. I’ve talked with people that are absolutely burnt out and with people that seem to have it all. My realistic question is, I’m a pretty avid climber, and how realistic it is that I keep climbing while being a consultant? I also have a group of friends that I climb with, and am wondering if it’s okay to set some boundaries with the firm if climbing is that singular thing that matter to me.

"Just been made redundant, what next?","Hi all,

I was just made redundant as of an hour ago and I’m fine right not but will imagine everything will come crashing down in the coming days. I would like to get a handle on things whilst my mind is clear as I know I have a tendency to sink into the pits of despair. 

Typical story, high bench utilisation, veryyy little work in general at the company but specifically for me I was put on really poor/not aligned projects that were extremely short. I won’t say I’m shocked as the business hasn’t been in a period of growth but on a human level I am so scared. 

Any tips or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. I have a screening call tomorrow for another consultancy but already seen in the Glassdoor reviews mentions of redundancy if on the bench. Maybe consulting isn’t for me? I don’t really appreciate how you can be let go on a random Monday morning despite you being good at your job, because of the business’s financial shortcomings.

Stories of good bosses,"If you have had a good boss (big if), what were they like, what did they do, and how did they lead?

Most common response tends to boil down they didn’t micromanage. Micromanaging sucks but just not doing it isn’t a very high standard for being good.

I’ll start: figuring out what each employee on the team is actually good at and empowering them to focus on that. Sometimes that involves a change in job title but a lot of times it’s freeing up people to do what they were supposed to have been hired to do instead of a hundred others things because the org lacks processes, ownership, and good collaboration.",hola_jeremy,1oa6tne,consulting,18-10-2025,20:44:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1oa6tne/stories_of_good_bosses/

Does all the actual work always get pushed down to the juniors?,"The news about Deloitte getting caught pawning off unchecked AI slop as billable work isn't all that surprising when you see how much work is just junior employees sending deliverables up the ranks for directors to sign off on and submit to the client.

"Moving on from Big4 (EY), here are my lessons that I learned after 10 years... (Throwaway)","THROWAWAY ACCOUNT AND SOME VAGUENESS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS

Hey everyone, I actually didn't know too many people in my group who got laid off. I was one of the few. I was at EY almost 10 years and was a highly paid manager in consulting (I saw the #s, or at least the numbers I was showed). I also recently got kicked out of Fishbowl for making fun of conservative people so well that they complained about me. That place is turning into a cesspool as well.  

Anyway, as a former kool-aid drinker, the rose-colored glasses started falling off the second Trump got elected the first time. Then the 2nd time he was elected I saw a former partner who led a DEI/LGBT call the year before like a LinkedIn post where they no longer had to refer to people by their preferred pronouns which trickled into every big 4. This is all to say, CORPORATE AMERICA IS A GAMESHOW based off of the military and Big4 and above are simply the Marines.  

The amount of work you do at these places will never be the same anywhere else. That's just a fact. And now with AI, it's more of a cakewalk, but I was in Big4 while we had to travel every week to a client site and still get all this work done. Regardless of the outcome, I was able to land safely somewhere else and I truly believe in karma and never had to step on people's toes to get ahead until now.  

Ok, so actually helpful takeaways:  

1) Don't be over-helpful: Sure, every Partner/SM will applaud your efforts, heck you may even make it to the next level or get a gift-card, but helpful people don't get to the end. Logan Roy is right, you gotta be a killer if you are going to make it to SM/Partner. Not only because of internal politics, but clients who hate your guts and make you suffer just to see you squirm is a thing. I was overly helpful and at a certain point I just got so burnt-out I hated everyone. Worked out of that habit, but the damage is done (what can I say). If you aren't a killer, figure out what you truly want and you don't have to stay in one place as long as I did. But, I did mostly need money at the time so that worked out.

2) Be an ass kisser: Sorry, you will have to laugh at shitty jokes and go to stupid happy hours. I get GenZ is changing workplace dynamics, but if you are going to do traditional white collar work route and you have an -ism/-ist behind you (like if people can be racist, sexist, ableist towards you) you probably need to try and appear like you want to be there even if it's overall shitty. It sucks to have to do, but honestly, you will more than likely need to 90% of the time. Optics matter even if Brad and Chad own the joint. And yes white dudes, you're still 90% of the C-Suite among other things. So, most of the time it is Brad and Chad. They always show up at these things at least.  

3) Power is psychological; THIS IS high-school: This is what Big4/Consulting in general gets correct. Are some of the leaders decent people? Sure, but the decent ones never last and if they do, they are secretly a lizard person as well (well, because they have to be to survive). Power structures, chains of command, etc., it's all made-up. Just like a high-school bully has ""power"" but really it's usually a them issue than a you issue. Leaders don't want you to know that and unfortunately the more you fear them/obey them, yes the more you have a job, but the less you are yourself. You aren't supposed to bring your whole self to work. That is also BS. If you fit into a role into a leadership group, stay there especially if you are getting trained to be the next person in line. These people in leadership will get old and go away soon enough. They need the next Brads and Chads. If your boss drinks, unfortunately you will need to drink. If your boss golfs/unfortunately, you will need to learn how to golf. But if you were to say compartmentalize yourself so you don't bring this crap home with you, you'll do great! Trauma survivors unite! We seem to thrive in these environments and leaders know that because they psycho-analyzed you the moment you walked through the door (and can also last the most with drinking). Also, that's the reason why you always dress nice the first time meeting someone. The things your parents and my parents said are true. Also on this, I mean SMs and Partners do need to make little gangs to gang up on all of you Managers and below. Some shark species attack in a school and circle and surround their prey. If it ever feels like that being the case for you whatever level, you are not imagining things, you are being triangulated against 100%. The only real power they have is not staffing you. That is the last resort to get you out :)  

4) Prioritize your career; not your title: Countless projects led me to discover a lot of client leaders didn't know shit and even current leaders in your group also don't know shit. But, they learn. They ask questions. They take the courses. They prioritize this. NO MATTER WHAT, there is always something you can be learning/doing with soft skills and hard skills. You need both whatever your next role will be. This is your parachute anywhere in and out of a job. It's always going to be this way. Other leaders in a variety of industries saying school is useless still send their children to the same schools. Follow their actions, not words.  

5) Keep your sanity; BUT, don't tell people how you do that: That bringing your whole self to work thing? That's over. It was never a thing to begin with. No one should truly care about what everyone is doing after work and this isn't me being anti-social. You never know who is going through a bad time in life in general, so just be very vague about everything. The second you unknowingly piss off the partner who is getting a divorce and you start to rant about your honeymoon, it's over. Keep your emotions to yourself because literally, your bosses/coworkers/clients will be the last people who will help you out of a rut/bad place. That's where you family, friends, hobbies, things you love to do come in. Protect it entirely with all your heart and keep it for yourself.  

6) Lightning round:  

\- Unless that promotion is on paper, you aren't getting it. And willing to be if it's not on paper and you ask for it to be written on paper, they won't write it on paper. Get everything in writing!  

\- Consulting is and will always be up and out. If you are being offered a ""highly-paid"" lower title, that means they need you to keep doing the work, but don't want you to leave, but also don't want you to the next SM/Partner level. That's fine, that's the level where they neglect their families and friends or start using drugs to not do that, but then argue on calls with other leaders because of withdrawals.  

\- There will always be bad people. Narcissist, psychopaths, sociopaths (the scariest), they will be everywhere always in your life. It's up to you to learn how to stand-up to these people even if it means losing your job or having to defend yourself. All you have is your name and reputation, the second someone tries to ruin that, you need to shut that down 1:1 ALWAYS no questions asked.  

\- If it acts like a duck, quacks like a duck, and walks like a duck, it's a fucking duck. Judge leaders by their actions not their words. Trust your gut. It's usually right.  

\- Create passive income streams like your life depends on it because one day it will.  

As much as I'd love to stay and chat, this was just the grenade I wanted to throw into this sub. A lot of people on YouTube this layoff season came out with the same content that mostly validated and articulated a lot of the same feelings I had about corporate America. While sacrifices can get you very far, don't forget to live life. One day you'll turn around and no one is going to be there. Always prioritize your personal relationships and the people who lift you up (who may not even be family or someone you haven't met yet).  

And lastly, this is just a job. Even if it is ""prestigious"", it's a job that you have no control over.

But, bosses cannot control your heart, your thoughts, your spirit. If they laugh at that statement or you can imagine them laughing at that, it means they have none and are more poor than you in that regard.  Results may vary if you take my advice and this is mostly if you want to stay in the game of corporate America. If you have rich parents or some means to not work in corporate America, what are you doing? GTFO and give someone else a shot who would actually benefit from actually having life changing money. You people are kind of the worst actually. You literally have options to do anything else and choose a normal job?

Question for past/current independent Consultants,"People who went out on their own, 

1. What was your career journey during and/or after starting out as an independent consultant?

3. What long term goals did you establish as your progressed on the journey. Did you achieve any of them and did they meet your expectations?

  
A little about me if anyone is able to provide insights based on my situation:

30m just kind of found myself in this position by happenstance after getting laid off. Been doing it about a year and recently incorporated. Billing \~100hrs/month @ an average rate of $100/hr. With BD and admin working like \~140hrs/month. Booked up for next 6 months so I have some breathing room to think about next moves. Don't want to go back to working for the man. Don't want to be an individual contributor in 20 years trying to keep up. Don't want to go down the standard route of burning my hourly hiring someone I can afford so I can make a few bucks on their hourly, rinse repeat, etc... 

My ideal outcome is building tools/software that automates my work and transitioning to SaaS and/or securing a small exit and moving on to something else. Really out of my depth there technically though and not sure if the market is there. 

Where does that leave me realistically? What are some things I can work towards? Is there some path I'm not seeing that I can go down without compromising too much?

Time to start looking for a new role?,"Suddenly, I'm in a weird spot and would love to hear your take. If you were me, would you start looking for a new role now or wait until there is more clarity? 

I'm employed by an F100 as an EM, permanently assigned to a client. I am running a strategy integration project with the client to utilize the statistical brainpower and data collection abilities of my F100 firm, transform their (primitive) data, and turn it into customer and regional insights. We use the insights for optimization of their current physical footprint and for more strategic expansion decision making. It's a project that costs them $750k a year (including myself, a part time analyst, part time data scientist modeling work, and the mobile data that needs to be purchased). Payback is, at worst, 20X. Just one bad lease and buildout in the wrong location can be a $10M mistake. Given that this data is being used for upwards of 100 decisions a year, it's an obvious sanity check if nothing else. Roughly 20% of optimization and expansion decisions are reviewed once we look at the insights I've created, and 50% of those decisions are overturned or updated. At 10/year, that's $75k per avoidance of a ""bad"" decision that can cost the client $5M/$10M each.  

We recently found out that the client is getting a new COO. Everything that is contracted will be under review after the new year. The COO is well known from his previous role and has a rep for NOT liking consultants. I'm confident in my ability to get in the room and ""sell"" the project, but that's a tough ask if I don't have a chance to get in the room or if the COO is in ""clean house, baby out with the bathwater mode"". 

My chances of remaining with the F100 firm are slim if they axe my program: I was hired specifically for this project due to my background in growth and optimization strategy. Most of my firm's $ are made elsewhere and consulting is really just a loss-leader to help out large clients. 

I can't really afford a big stint on unemployment; kids are not cheap and my wife works in one of those fields that requires a doctorate's but is no longer valued highly by society. She's been taking an inflation-adjusted pay cut yearly for over a decade now.     

If you were me, how would you proceed? If we can keep this project going, I'd love to stay on and even expand it. But the COO seems like a step back into the dark ages and the last thing I want is to stay through the new year, only to find out that we are axed and I'm in the bread line. I'd ideally wouldn't quit until after Jan 1, if only to ensure I get my entire bonus.

Is investment banking much more chill then MBB from >associate?,"This is a thing that truly baffles me. I live in a city with noteable IB presence and thus have various acquaintances (basically alumns, not really close friends) in banking. 

What I hear between the lines and what is also the general wisdom online is that banking is off the charts demanding as an analyst, but gradually improves in lifestyle thereafter. 

I'm at MBB and I observe the opposite. I feel like the most chill possition is senior associate (2-3 year tenure) slightly before EM promotions. You know how to work and have the toolkit, which makes you efficient, while not having the overall project responsibility.

When you get to EM the stress increases because know you are the main point of contact for partners, clients, juniors, etc. - take the next step to AP and the stress increases way more and you find yourself working around the clock across 2-3 live engagements, various client discussions, firm events, etc.

I am just wondering:

Are the bankers exaggerating or is the MBB deal really cooked from EM and above? I mean a VP at a banks make so much more money. And people basically tell me those guys are working 9-7/8 and then logging off. Whereas the typical AP works rather 9 - Midnight / 1am with frequent 7am flights. 

What I am not getting: 

We all know how sharp ellbowed/tough commoditized professional services environments are. I just don't see how an VP at good place like GS/MS/JP or other BBs would just be able to cruise around those hours. There is just always SH\*T to be done, be it on a live deal that blows up or countless of client discussions that can be started/need decks to improve, etc.  

Given that I put in some years at MBB now I just don't see how any professional services job could be done working less than 12-15h everyday - there is just always so much going on and the whole model hinges on extracting just a little more from people.",Extension_Turn5658,1o5e7nz,consulting,13-10-2025,08:34:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1o5e7nz/is_investment_banking_much_more_chill_then_mbb/

Sloppy data coming from client: how to get them to change habits?,"I'm working with a client right now and the structure of their data is infuriating. It's just plain sloppy. Inconsistent. Filled with mistakes that I hopefully catch.

For example, I get a lot of data tables that concern decisions, which I then feed into a master dataset, which informs a status dashboard and FP&A budgeting tools I've built. The tools search the data for very specific actions as defined in column A, action details as defined in column B, and year of action in column C. I set up specific criteria for all 3, using Excel drop downs.

For example, if they want to invest in a current location with an interior renovation in 2029, they would choose ""invest"" in action-Column A, ""interior renovation"" for action type in column B, and ""2029"" for action year in column C..  If they want to close a location in 2027, they would choose ""close"" in column A, ""decommission"" in column B, and ""2027"" in column C. These are drop-downs and literally every possible scenario is available in what I've set up to choose.

When I get the action plan back from the client after they've input their data, they've completely ignored my drop downs and done their own thing. ""Invest"" might say ""invest"", ""investment"", ""spend money on location"". Also, ""Invest-2029"". ""Interior Renovation"" now exists alongside ""Renovation-Interior"", ""Reno-INT"", and ""renovate-full interior"".  The 3rd column is mostly used but they are duplicating it in the first column.

First off, it's terrible data management. Don't use multiple phrases for the same action. Don't co-mingle action type and action year. Why start inputting phrases nilly-willy when everything is pre-defined for a reason?

Second, it increased the burden on me to fix everything and interpret their work. Not good. Now the burden is on me to fix the mistakes of others. 

For those of you who've been here, how did you get them to buy in? I've already asked politely that they use the pre-defined criteria. No response.

Thoughts on going from MBB to fintech?,"What the title says. I’ve been working at MBB for 4 years. Did a bunch of projects in many sectors. Now I got an offer to support Chief of Strategy and Innovation in (many) projects that they have (expanding to new geographies for example)

I liked the role because it will allow me to build something with very smart people (and they offered better WLB)

Am I overthinking? How do I stay relevant? Is it absolutely necessary that I know SQL, Figma Looker, Power Query? (There is a high chance that this is impostor syndrome but still)

Got feedback from the account manager that I need to do less work for the client,"I started a new consulting role three months ago, and the team I am on has a lot of work. However, the work is not equally distributed on the team. There’s four people on a ten person team who have too much work to do, and then there are three or four developers who really don’t have that much work to do at all. I feel guilty because I’m making a pretty high salary and working fully remote, so I feel like in order to make my salary worthwhile to the company I should be finding things to do. However, I have gotten hand slapped a few times when I tried to go make my own user story tickets inside jira, or when I go off and build features that I think would be helpful. Today the account manager for the client gave me a call and told me to be less eager on the job lol.

I am struggling with a manager and clueless on next steps,"Hi, 

I just started working on a high stakes project and my manager and I didn't hit it off from day 1. The first red flag was him telling me how he replaced the previous manager who according to him was incompetent. 

  
Then came the working style, the whole team of 12 other consultants and their stream managers leave the office to work from home by 7pm and I am forced to stay until 3am.  

Then came the taking credit part, he quotes in meetings: ""I stayed up all night to improve the deck,"" I this, I that. He is never online on the deck...

Four days into the project he added me into a feedback session with the partner, no feedback directly, nothing. A straight away call with the partner on my ""performance."" The feedback was that my stream is lagging behind, when we all know for a fact mine is the only stream that has completed the maximum number of deliverables. Second feedback was that I don't join in on meetings. Guess what, I have asked my manager to add me in multiple times but he didn't. 

Finally, he doesn't agree with anything I have to say. If there are 30 assumptions in the model, well sourced, he will question and keep arguing with me over them. I have made the same model with four different approaches now and its just not working with him. 

  
My counterparts on the project have also noticed his behavior and remarked that he treats my work a lot more differently than theirs. 

  
My last few reviews were impeccable so I am not taking most of it to heart, I just don't want him to destroy me in the upcoming review cycle. Considering that my company had 4 layoff cycles this year, what's my best strategy: Should I roll off the project and pray to be staffed soon or shall I suck it up?",BeautifulWill7538,1nynsy8,consulting,05-10-2025,13:10:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1nynsy8/i_am_struggling_with_a_manager_and_clueless_on/

Do lots of consulting firms just use Excel + middle manager?,"When it comes to resource mgmt & allocation where I've been, seems like practically everything is Excel. Sure they have an ATS and HRIS, but when it comes to knowing who's on which project, the bench, utilization rates, profiles, even open positions etc, everyone just goes to Excel. Needless to say, version control is a mess and everyone has their own private single source of truth :) 

They hire mid-level managers to track all the moving parts against their spreadsheets. When a client partner needs info on available resources, they just fire off emails and chats to these operators who then in turn just relay info. Seems like so much of this would be better if there were actually a centralized single source of truth and info was self-serve instead of playing games of telephone. So much stuff falls through the cracks with all the ad hoc communication.

Having severe anxiety disorder at MBB - whats next,"Hey all, I could use some advice or perspective.

I’m a recent grad working at MBB, and I just got promoted. On paper, things look good — but mentally I’ve been falling apart.

I usually break down in tears every weekend (since I barely have time to process things on weekdays). I can’t focus at work because of the stress. Physically it’s showing too: my hands shake and my resting heart rate is constantly around 100+.

Why I feel stuck:
	•	I don’t know where to go from here. My experience feels too limited for senior roles, and the job market only makes my anxiety worse.
	•	I just got promoted, but I’m worried about letting down the MDP who supported me.
	•	I’m staffed on a case until Q2 next year. If I quit now, they’ll need to reshuffle the team — but if I stay, I feel like I’m just going to keep suffering. And even leaving requires a one-month notice.

Classes and background on how to learn and leverage AI-recommendations wanted,"I'd love to become more proficient in AI: both for my personal use of time (heavy data analysis), market comparison (10K competitor review) and eventually to streamline client processes such as reviewing supplier contracts and real estate leases.

For example, when I wanted to pivot into finance, I probably did 60 hours of Excel through WSP and Excel Campus. I was a total noob and now I'm a power user. It's invaluable to my job; I literally wouldn't have my role if I couldn't do complex modeling in Excel for the client. I've also taken courses in Python for finance, which I don't use often these days but taught me, in general, new ways of structuring problems. Still valuable at a general knowlege level.  

I'm looking for that level of learning in AI, coming from the standpoint of a beginner.

McKinsey not being looked at favorably in interviews lately,"Hello everyone, hoping to get some thoughts/perspectives on this.

Was with McKinsey for three years right out of college, promoted a few times, worked some interesting cases, etc.

Left for a really interesting, flexible and lucrative position outside of consulting. Now I’m looking at jobs and having trouble/side eyes in interviews. Frankly, it seems like people don’t really care about McKinsey on the resume, or they don’t view it favorably. I have another prestigious job on my resume that they don’t really care about.

My resume is good, I have plenty of people who dm me on LinkedIn asking if I’m interested for roles, etc - I basically talk all day so I’m good at presentation and being professional, and just generally presenting a business acumen that obviously carries experience/know how.

I don’t know why, but I’ve struck out on like three interviews the past month. I usually get to the third or fourth before I run into someone who’s near combative and/or extremely demanding in their questions.

They’re not ‘hard’ questions, but they’re demanding me to recall names and dates from five plus years ago, questioning me if I don’t remember exactly what tool I used for a process mapping effort when I was an intern in college, smiling after asking an obviously tough question, etc. 

The fun part is, I can answer these! And I frequently am impressed with my own recall, I’ve never been dumbstruck by these questions or borderline rude interviewers. I hate that I can sense their combativeness, they have a disagreement with me, I can sense there is something they want to say but of course never come out and say it. 

Anyway, I have gotten a couple offers, passed on them for RTO reasons.

Was it much easier to make MBB partner in the 1990s/2000s or was that a different role?,"I often observed this already on linkedin profiles of some consulting veterans. I.e., they state something like ""Joined MCK/BCG/BAIN 1992"" with job title consultant and then from 1997 Job title switches to partner.

Never thought much about this but recently read this article here on the McK CEO pipeline and saw the following again: 

""Fraser joined [McKinsey](https://fortune.com/company/mckinsey/) in 1994, fresh from Harvard Business School, and the superpower she learned there was “problem structuring.” ... by the time she made partner in 1997—at the age of 30""

Does anyone have an insight how the title partner was perceived back then? On the one hand, it was a much more exclusive club (I imagine in 1997 there were for sure less then 300 McK partners) but on the other hand I read these articles of people becoming partners after 3-5 years.

Even if she joined as an experienced hire this is absolutely insane to go from fresh MBA associate to partner in 3 years.

Feeling dissatisfied with my post consulting job,"I was working in MBB for 3 years, performed well, but got burnt out and decided to leave, after which I switched to a online startup in December. After almost a year, I feel like I:
- Like the work a lot more (consumer products, real impact less ambiguity, more interesting overall with a lot more data)
- Like the hours (from 65 to 50)

So I don't really want to return to consulting. However, 
- The people around me aren't that smart or motivated, and that's also having a knock on on me where I feel lazier around doing something. My work ethic is not at good
- Learning is much more self driven, and slower. My work is executional and very repetitive. The work is not that deep either, though more exciting overall. 
- Pay and career path is slower. I took a small cut, but growth is expected to be fairly stagnant. 
- The org is very top heavy where the norm isn't to challenge the management. This is something I feel differently about, and honestly feel like they're not as involved or guiding as MBB partners are. It's a bit laissez faire - and my work isn't scrutinized much (so hence I don't see incentives for my work ethic)

Director left and now kind of stuck,"Good day all

Looking for your advice here,

A director who I've been working almost exclusively with over the past few years has gone and i have no clear path forward. 


We had a great relationship and I was a trusted resource for him - he was great at business development, technical knowledge, stakeholders management etc. We thought in similar ways and i never struggled to have him see my point of view or approach during delivery.
He was also also setting me up for on-sell opportunities.


He has however recently resigned, and it's left me with a massive concern - none of the other leadership know enough about me, my skills, have worked with me, or have space for me in their cliques. They've got their preferred staffing already, and it's clear where their allegiances are. They have their own ""mentees"" that they're setting up for success by developing, staffing and squaring up for leading on/up sells.

I feel stuck, and like I put my eggs in one basket (though, with the nature of the work I don't know how I could've done things differently). I met with other leadership every month or so, so im known, but not well enough to be staffed by them - especially over someone else already in their inner circle.

I have no idea now, how to meet my targets, what I should've done differently and how I could recover (which feels impossible).

Note: I am open to leaving, on a competitive offer, but in the current job market this is unlikely.

Would appreciate advice on this

feeling sad about my consulting job,"started MBB recently and Im very anxious 

I really want to succeed but it feels as though the system is against me

In a team meeting last week my manager joked about not liking another consultant because they “like wearing suits” and are “too serious.” This comment hit me so hard because I’m introverted and wear suits to work. This manager also doesn’t acknowledge my work but acknowledges it when it’s done by other people. Has happened so many times. They’ve never given me a single good comment/acknowledged how I’ve driven most of our work. 

I go to work anxious, I feel like I now need to try really hard to be seen/liked/acknowledged. 

What could I be doing wrongly? 

Any advice on how to succeed in consulting ? ",NoseAffectionate5751,1nqm6pi,consulting,25-09-2025,23:37:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1nqm6pi/feeling_sad_about_my_consulting_job/
MBB is the worst ROI: So what alternatives are better?,"I've developed elsewhere why MBB has the worst ROI on Earth, so what has a stronger ROI you might ask? If you're a young buck full of vim considering going in MBB, take a step back and read before making the worst mistake of your life.

Being in my early thirties, I've seen how my university cohort went, so I can build the definitive ranking of the common MBB alternatives with metaphysical certainty.

GOD TIER

Med school - for quality of life and money. If you're into ca$$h and an excellent life quality, nothing beats being an MD. Total job security, LCOL area, and relatively relaxed workload (you're so rich you don't need to work full time). Only downside is the lack of explosive growth.

Politics. Intellectual level is fairly low. Every single person from my cohort who took it seriously is now at ministerial level or below. Just that easy. Job security isn't there, true, but can't be worse than consulting.

A TIER

IB to PE. Just do it. Even a tier Z IB translates into a tier 2 PE boutique, and from there, you're set for life. Rich people (boomers) always have more money, this trickle down to more PE money. Put in those two years and you're the magic money man. I'd say the worst boutique you can find founded by two coked up ex JPM senior associates stands head and shoulder above McKinsey. Lower average comp than a doctor, but a bit more explosive value if you create your own fund at 45/50. Every fund in the world has min 10B AuM these days, just pick one word, one adjective and one verb and that's your unique thesis.

Civil Service / judiciary. If you get into one of the top exams (different for my american friends, I know : then let's say one of the good federal agencies), you're set for life + have the explosive upside of getting a cabinet rank and all the little privileges that let you live like a king. Absolute comp is mid though.

B TIER - still better than MBB but dominated

Law. Same abuse as consulting but the salaries are better and you can still hang your own shingle when you're burn out. You don't go to nothing when you're forever unemployed : you remain a lawyer.

Uni professor. For all the complaining about muh Phd, muh postdoc, it's relatively short and if you're from a decent uni, you'll get an AP tenure track job. Super chill, LCOL area. A bit toxic and silly to publish stuff no one reads but you can larp as a Call of Cthulhu New England professor. True international mobility too, so enjoy the semi retirement in \*random japanese university\* to larp as a Higurashi extra.

Hedge fund quant, research analyst etc. Surprisingly hard because you're not paid that much and you need to make some actual alpha. Remember : you want to be a parasite of the system, not actually having to work hard and make some real money.

Corporate Lifer. Very dominated, as you \*will\* get fired at 45 and never find a job. You just avoided spending your life in hell before that.

Dog TIER

SWE. The ultimate grind. I would \*still\* rank it higher than consulting because if you're a good enough BSer, you can raise millions as the ""technical founder"" and live off the grift for life. But it's a minority event.

Clown. Pays surprisingly well.

Feeling sick of my field,"Junior SAP FICO consultant here. It's been more than a year since I finished college and started doing SAP FICO consulting. I said I had a double degree in Banking and Asset management and I was interested in being a business analyst and working in ERP. They naturally assigned me to FICO module based on that. I don't enjoy accounting at all, but I though I would shut up and make my way through FI in order to open doors to other things.

One year has passed, about to start my third project, done mostly FI and I'm feeling, like, SICK of it. I like numbers and cash, and payments and stuff like that but I'm sick of ledgers, assets depreciation, compliances. audit journal etc... I just can't take it anymore.

Positioning myself for M>SM at a boutique?,"A few years back, I saw the writing on the wall and left Salesforce after landing some solo consulting work with a former consulting client (<6 months later, half my org was made redundant). I’ve led very large and complex Salesforce programs (implementation + governance, adoption, etc), and am one of the few architects in my niche.

Recently, a boutique firm recruited me for a role supporting their F100 client mid-implementation. The original stakeholder and much of his org were recently laid off, leaving this boutique's client to inherit the platform, and is now being measured on ROI. The boutique had a handful of devs scattered across a few Salesforce products, but nobody with experience across the platform let alone at the level necessary for the client's needs, so they brought me in as a Manager above their pay band, but below my Salesforce comp. I joined to escape constant sales pressure as a solo consultant, and for the opportunity to lead a large engagement at an even higher level than my prior experience.

Everything is going smoothly, I’m already steering the client away from pitfalls and setting them up for success. Assuming I'm able to keep driving and scaling things throughout the next fiscal year, this boutique will gain a lot of credibility with future clients and Salesforce talent (former colleagues have already expressed an interest in joining my team). 

I'd like to start setting expectations with my manager about a 15% - 20% raise and promotion to SM at the end of year. To be blunt, there's little incentive for me to stay at a boutique this size if I'm not getting promoted rapidly, and I'm confident that I can turn this one-off engagement into a bona fide Salesforce practice, which includes establishing a partner relationship with Salesforce and getting plugged into RFPs/pitches with the Salesforce license teams. 

The approach I have in mind is to discuss with my manager and lead with my vision on how I'll build the practice over the next year concurrent with this engagement. They have a scrappy startup culture, so I believe they would be (should be, idk maybe I'm delulu) happy to accommodate me if there's sufficient value for them (partly evidenced by them already paying me out of band). 

What I want to avoid is being in an awkward position in a year where I don't see the value in staying in this org at the same level, and them not wanting to promote me until I have another offer in hand. Currently they're pretty much letting me run with it in my role since, again, they had zero Salesforce capabilities. I'm proactively setting my own deliverables and timelines, and creating the strategy and executing against it. Everyone is happy, and I think in a year I'll need that promotion and raise to keep operating in this fashion while building the practice, and moving towards selling and leading multiple engagements concurrently. 

Would appreciate any discussion and feedback, thanks! ",WifeLover928,1nnslmn,consulting,22-09-2025,17:19:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1nnslmn/positioning_myself_for_msm_at_a_boutique/
Sales and Marketing to Corporate Strategy,"I’ve worked in F500s for 12 years in a series of sales, marketing, and strategy roles. I’m frankly tired of it. 

It’s the same shit quarter to quarter with annual layoffs since leadership is inept. 

I want out of the operations grind. The daily commercial side of the business is painful and stupid. I find myself making the same slides year after year while the business refuses to make necessary changes. 

However…

We do have a corporate strategy team of 6-10 people who don’t have impressive resumes, own ostensibly nothing, and somehow seem to never be affected by layoffs. 

I see director level corporate strategy people leading workshops where they just take notes and heard the cats. Deliverables are slides and models, expectations are low, and they have no ownership of any business outcome besides generating decks. 

Sounds like a fucking dream. 

There are a few go-getter type sales and marketing folks who are grumpy demanding a-holes who do well, but the rest aren’t making much money. 

These corp strategy guys and gals are making the same that I am (mid 200s base), get tons of visibility, and are not tied to any business outcome.

To give you a concrete example (and this has happened more than once): we deliver outputs to clients that they can’t actually use. Naturally, the clients complain, and then instead of fixing the root issue, we end up creating “guides” to explain how they *should* use those deliverables… even though we all know they’re not really usable in the first place. So I find myself putting extra effort into producing useless guides just to patch over bad deliverables.

Independent consultants - contract process challenges,"
Hi All,

I’ve had a couple of really gnarly contract negotiations recently, including one so bad that I walked away from the engagement. I’d really like to hear from others your experiences and best practices for getting contracts over the finish line in a way that’s mutually beneficial and mutually protective. 

Some examples
- Company can fire me anytime, but I can’t leave the engagement until they decide I can 
- Wildly inconsistent legal language (like someone copy/pasted from 30 documents and called it done), with utter refusal to address them 
- Two months into contract process they spring a new agreement draft on me and demand signing immediately. It’s 25 pages single spaced, and extremely exacting, and written like they’re taking a risk by hiring a criminal like me 
- Seven types of insurance required, at limits my broker cannot procure for a one-person shop like me. 
- Can’t use AI during the course of work for the company. Mind you, I give talks on using AI as part of coaching product teams. 

The above is always combined with an aggressive, hostile person trying to push it over the finish line at the last minute - and acting as if I’m negligent and unreasonable at every turn. And what’s weird is that my business is entirely people who know/trust me hiring me. I don’t seek work; they come to me. 

Talk to me about how you’ve managed this, or just what you’ve experienced in your business. ",Expensive-Mention-90,1nmyam8,consulting,21-09-2025,17:39:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1nmyam8/independent_consultants_contract_process/

Struggling with imposter syndrome while looking for different job,"
Context:

- Been in a combination sales/consultancy delivery role for 6 years, always hit target 
- Currently at 70% target for the year, market very tough this year
- Been in current role (Principal Consultant, was previously Director) since Jan 25, with no line manager, no training, until recently very poor marketing team, expected to build outbound strategy in new markets with no budget/support/coaching
- One person at my level has already been sacked for not meeting target, with another on PIP currently
- New line manager has just started, seems like a decent guy but I think I’m done

Shared my context above as I’m in a bit of an odd niche, but going to ask for help anyway. I think I’ve reached the end of my rope at work. It’s a combination of a lot of factors but the main issues are feeling that I’ve been setup to fail (although I’m doing OK despite that), that I’ve hit the ceiling of how far I can progress here (small business, and my new line manager basically means I can’t go further than where I am now) and…I’m just done. 

I’m looking to move into a sales/business development leadership role now - no more fee-earning. 

I’ve been a decent sales person the last 6 years - my role is a bit unusual (although typical for consulting firms) where I deliver the work and sell it. I build great relationships, my clients come back again and again, I’ve got a decent network, I work with C Suite and very senior people really well - lots of credibility. Consistently get excellent feedback on my work. 

I’m looking for Head of/Director of Sales/BD type jobs but really struggling to believe that I can do them. The last 6 months particularly have really attacked my confidence, and I just don’t feel like I have anything to give. I look at what I do and think “so what?” It’s like I can’t quantify what I’ve done or my skills to update my CV.

MBB is the great career decelerator -- the career kiss of death,"Won't be a popular opinion, but make of it what you will. MBB AP here. Started my career as an FP&A analyst in a boring F500 equivalent company in my european home country. Told myself I was bored to death and wasn't doing the right thing. I moved to MBB - literally the worst job in the world - and the rest is history. Now looking for an exit with the mass layoffs and, of course, not finding anything after 600 applications and some useless coffee chats. I probably covered every single job for which I was barely eligible in the entire continent, from Big tech to some niche software roles to foundations to classic (but elusive) corporate strategy roles.

My only serious lead is a regional bank job in bumfuck nowhere. At least it pays the bills and avoids the stench of unemployment, especially in this economy. I see many, many MBB ex-consultants being durably unemployed. It starts with ""freelancing"" a few months, then never being hired permanently, and then simply drifting.

I can't help but think that, had I stayed in my FP&A role, I would have had a great network at a solid F500 company and would probably be at Director level, on an Exco track. The stress is much lower, they don't fire you every 2 years, the pay is the same... It even screwed with my plan to exit to public service. I had an excellent score on the exams -- some of the most competitive in the country -- but of course, was torched at the oral examination, with my consulting background being a big no / no.

And if I wanted to grind, even Big4 TA people have it better, exiting to PE (often offers list Big 4 TA as a requirement).

I think, structurally, MBB is the only career that makes it x10 more horrible for a x0.1 result vs. staying on your trajectory.

Some would say ""skill issue"" but I assure you I see many ex-AP trapped in unemployment. I intend to escape through sheer willingness to accept anything. And ""but it's worth it above for partners"". Is it? Really? Ex senior partners escaped being VPs of a big defense contractor. They're on a hiring spree. Hiring useless SPs for ""AI"" although they never worked on it, go figure those boomers. Well you know who else are VPs? The lifers. And they are VPs of core functions, not the useless ""AI Strategy"".

Truly, I can hardly think of a worst investment. It's not just useless, it's actively value destroying. My advice to those trapped in it? Get out, fast. Treat it as a sunk cost. Even if the exits are bad (they are) it's still better to amputate a member so the body can survive.

Edit : after 3 months, 900 apps, 50 processes and 150 headhunters, I found a mid-level transfo job for a mid-level company. Even that feels unreal. I truly thought I'd be forever unemployed. Even a mediocre job at best is x10 better than my likely outcome. Maybe something better will come in the meantime, although I doubt it, but who knows. I can finally focus on more selective opportunities. If it does, I'll share the ROI by channel (apps, headhunters, ""network""). So far it was a raw app that yielded the opportunity, that had a very short process.

 For everyone else who’s dealt with this, what did you do? Would love recent examples too since jobs appear much harder to get now than in 2021 for example.

**The play:**

* Look for SMEs/startups with \~2.5–3 star reviews on Google/Trustpilot.
* Dig through the reviews, spot the recurring issues (late deliveries, shitty support, refund headaches, etc).
* Put together a short “Revenue Leak” doc showing: *“Here’s where you’re bleeding money, here’s how much revenue you could gain if it’s fixed.”*
* Send it straight to the owner as a hook to start a convo.
* Thinking of doing \~300 reach-outs in 3 months.

**Why I thought this works:**

* Reviews are just evidence, I’m not selling “better reviews.” I’m selling *more revenue if you fix the broken CX/ops*. I am a bit aggressive here,
* It feels more tangible than the usual “let me optimize your processes” type pitch.

**What’s bugging me:**

* Will SME/startup owners actually pay for this, or will they just shrug and say “yeah, we know”?
* Am I shooting myself in the foot by sharing their dirty laundry and making them look bad?

Claude Pro vs Max experience for consulting,"Wanted to share my most recent experience from this week. I'm a Claude Pro subscriber using it for a lot of daily tasks at the boutique I'm working for mostly in the fintech space. Earlier this week I had to draft the outline for a final report, I hit my limit with Claude, so I switched to Max and thought maybe it's also a good time to get Opus' help. There were ca. 25 files - previous strategy documents, workshop and interview notes, industry reports etc. - and I wanted it to prepare the outline for a 30 slides deck that has the usual: as-is, concept, implementation planning. For the first 2-3 hours of my usage I was fairly happy with it: the table of content looked promising, the as-is analysis was OK, though with some halucinations around market sizes, but then when it came to summarizing the recommendations it started to fall apart. Some of conclusions were wrong, when I asked with 'improve' to change after a while I realized some parts were not re-written even after multiple prompts. The implementation plan was all over the place and even though I provided specific asks on how to change it - it was still 'crap'.

I gave up at 1am and re-drafted myself the whole document from scratch based on the Sonnet summaries of the interview notes.

All in all, I feel:

\- Opus for consulting work is not the right tool: it overcomplicated stuff with too much BS

\- Max is not worth the 100 USD/month, it might help if you hit the usage limit, but doesn't give extra capabilities consultants would need

How Gen-Zers in MBB think about their way out?,"I've been at BCG for 4 years between 2012 and 2016 and in that timeframe I went from associate to project leader. I then left to build a saas company which we sold in late 2019 just before covid and since then I've been primarily active in web3/crypto building products and investing. So yeah, quite a different mindframe, activity and day-to-day now vs. my days in consulting, which nonetheless I remember in a very positive way.

Today I checked the situation for a GenZer in MBB and when you adjust the numbers for inflation the average BCG Associate is actually getting paid 13% less in real terms vs his peer in 2010 ($61k vs $70k). And I considered the official (fake) inflation numbers, I think we all know real ones are markedly worse. It feels to me that what was a golden cage in my days is becoming smaller and smaller.

I've been doing a lot of research lately on emerging movements of ""financial rebellion"" (eg SPX6900) which are imo the most interesting phenomena happening in crypto. Some calls this financial nihilism, I just think this is a way in which GenZ is expressing their reaction to hyper-inflation and discontent for being priced out from many traditional opportunities (especially in a post-AI era). And seeing these numbers it appears to me the same applies to the consulting industry too.

**Have you ever heard about these movements? Have you ever taken part in one? (e.g. the GME short squeeze in '21 or others on-chain?) How are you thinking about your way out of this slavery?**

I remember when people at BCG dismissed bitcoin and crypto entirely as a ponzi, a fraud, a way to money launder. It's perhaps engrained in their extremely consensus way of thinking (despite all the marketing BS). But I believe many in this sub should look into this as it's probably one of the few big opportunities before AI distrupts the job market as we know it.",yvthousands,1nj7yl3,consulting,17-09-2025,08:59:05,https://i.redd.it/ke6pttkxqopf1.png
Who typically tells the client you have resigned?,"Edit: thank you to those who answered so quickly, I feel better knowing this is not my responsibility at all and its managements. I will not be telling the client anything at this time. Thanks again so much :) 

As the title says I have resigned, I have provided over 3 weeks notice, this is a boutique firm so policies & procedures aren’t great, everything is basically figure it out yourself. My management is acting fairly immature, since I did not choose to stay they are understandably upset but not understandably furious & ignoring me. I assumed management would want to have the discussion with the client that there would be resource changes since they are in ongoing contract negotiations. I didn’t want to let them know myself and screw anything up during this time since I have been requested by name several times and they have had issues with other staff from the firm that’s almost caused the contract to be cancelled. 

However, I am coming on a week & half until my final day and my management has still not told the client. If there are no written policies on how I should proceed and my management team won’t speak to me as a result, is it okay for me to tell the client myself? Is there any policies or procedures at your firm for this that you can tell me so I can maybe follow them? 

I speak to the client multiple times a day and they really like me, so I don’t want to burn that bridge by giving them too short notice if they need anything transferred or anything last minute to make the transition easier.

"Solo fractional CIO drowning in generalist work, how do I scale my practice?","**TL;DR:** Solo fractional CIO (\~$250/hr) with happy clients and steady work. I’m spending too much time on delivery/generalist work and not enough on sales. Looking for playbooks on org design and first hires to scale without nuking margins or just getting over the fear.

**Context**

* Work: fractional CIO/CTO, digital transformation, integrations/automation across mixed stacks (no single-platform niche).
* Demand: a few long-standing clients; steady pipeline; I’m at/near capacity.
* Rate: \~$250/hr; clients value outcomes but often push back on “PM.”
* Current team: some offshore devs. I still do strategy, solution shaping, and a lot of direction.

**Bottlenecks**

* I’m the generalist architect + engagement manager. Hard to delegate without senior talent
* I avoid pushing for PM, which helps utilization short-term but caps growth
* Sales suffers because I’m buried in delivery

**What I’ve tried / current state**

* Offshoring implementation; I still own scoping/roadmaps/decisioning.
* Considering a niche (MS/SF/ERP), but I enjoy, and win, multi-system work.

**Questions for** r/consulting

1. If you were me, what’s the *first* hire: PM/Delivery Manager vs. Senior Generalist vs. Ops Coordinator? Why?
2. Stay integrator-generalist and build a partner bench (eg. MS/SF boutiques) or pick a flag and specialize?
3. How do you protect founder time for sales without hurting delivery quality?

**What “good” would look like for me**

* Keep gross margins ≥55–65%
* Founder time ≥40% on sales/partnerships
* Standardized discovery → roadmap → delivery governance flow
* Clear swimlanes so I’m “player-coach,” not the whole team

How important are titles? How would you approach this?,"Should I stay ~2 years in my current role to appear stable, or leave after ~1 year if growth is being blocked?

I joined the Strategy team at a PE-backed company. During interviews, I was told the role would be at Manager level, but the offer came through as Associate (I was at a higher level than associate). When I raised this, I was reassured it would be reviewed quickly. Months in, despite strong feedback from executives I’ve worked with (some even supporting the title adjustment), nothing has progressed.

The main challenge: my manager is controlling, appeases his leadership, and doesn’t care for his team. Titles across our team have been downgraded compared to other departments, and progression feels unlikely.

So now I’m weighing: stick it out for ~2 years for CV stability, or cut my losses after ~1 year if development and exposure don’t improve?

Comments here were great, I appreciate everyone's advice!

**original post

I'm a manager in a consulting firm and have resigned. My project goes until the end of October so they are desperate for me to stay. When I resigned I said I was flexible, but mentioned I did not want to stay that long. They asked for a few days to figure staffing out.
They came back today begging that I stay until the end of the project; that it's too complex to introduce someone new now. That they could work some conditions, like me being fully remote. To be honest I was already considering reducing considerably my in office presence during my notice, since what can they really do about it, fire me? Lol. Anyways, I said I'd think about it but reiterated it was too long for me.

At my firm, if you leave before the bonus payday (in March), you get nothing. I'm considering asking them to pay me my bonus proportional to the period worked, so 10 out of 12 months, which would mean 16.7% of my annual salary.

Is that an unreasonable ask? What would you consider reasonable?

I'm really looking forward to ditch the stress of this life, the client is a mess and I know that the end of this project is going to be putting out fire after fire.

I’ve never felt more dumb than I do now.

Director gifts ideas,"Good day all

I work at a boutique engineering consulting firm. A director, who interviewed me, acted as my mentor, was responsible for 80%+ of my staffing in projects, did a lot for my promotion nominations, and gave me multiple inter-firm awards etc. has handed in their resignation. He is prioritizing family life for a while, before he probbaly reaches out to his network.

He is middle aged, and is an absolute solid person- i actually teared up a bit when he broke the news to me over a teams call. 

I feel I owe my progress at the firm to him, and would like to get a gift to express this.

My ideas are

1. Leather bound notebook with personalized name/quote on it.
2.  Voucher of some kind  - restaurant or shopping mall


I'd appreciate any ideas!

"Mixed bag at MBB: Great reviews on tough projects, poor ones on easy ones — struggling to calibrate my actual competence.","I have had a mixed experience in MBB - I have had great reviews on projects that were challenging, bad reviews on projects that were supposedly easier. 

I have had many evaluators giving me different opinions on my competencies based on my respective projects and at this point I honestly do not have a gauge on how good/bad I am at this job. Some projects feel natural where team mates / project leaders are completely in sync with me while other projects feel so disjointed and has impacted my performance.

This mixed bag has led me to doubt my good reviews and consider the bad reviews as reflective of my competence. Logic being that the bad reviews are the actual representation of my competence as it is during these cases where I do not have the benefits/cushions of having good team chemistry / inspiration.

How to handle a 2-week notice to a consulting job?,"I’m working as a consultant but I’ve been contemplating getting out to a more stable job (less travel) since I have a dog and the travel has been exhausting the last 10 months.

"Consulting travel with a newborn, bring family along or not?","Hi all,

I’m a recent new parent working in consulting, and I have several work trips lined up in December (South Korea, Japan, and Singapore). My wife says she’s open to coming along with our newborn, and my company is very accepting of the idea.

A couple of things on my mind:

	•	We’ll only even consider it if our pediatrician clears us. safety first.

	•	Personally, I don’t want to lose a single moment of my daughter’s growth, so the idea of having them with me is very appealing.

	•	My concern is that my wife may not be aware of the realities of work travel me tied up in meetings and her being stuck in a hotel room with a baby in a new country.

Has anyone here brought their spouse and newborn on consulting trips? Was it rewarding to keep the family together, or more stressful than it was worth? How did you balance work obligations with family needs on the road?

MBB to PE,"I did the classic IB → PE track. Been in PE for 4 years across two funds, and literally every single person I’ve worked with (Associate through MD) came from banking. That said, I know a handful of consultant-friendly funds exist (Bain Cap, Golden Gate, AEA, etc.).

Here’s my somewhat controversial take: if your end goal is PE, MBB might actually set you up better than IB. Financial modeling is honestly very easy — you don’t need to work in banking to get good at modeling. IMO what matters more is the stuff consulting builds: structuring a story, presenting, and speaking confidently. Those skills are massively underrated in PE. Banking’s real value-add is the grind: you learn to take shit, crank through all-nighters, and survive.

My little brother is in college and wants to follow my path, but I’ve been telling him MBB might be the smarter move even if he ultimately wants PE. The catch is, I only know a handful of people who’ve actually made the MBB → PE jump, while most of my consultant friends ended up in corporate, startups, etc.

TLDR: Banking provides a more guaranteed path into PE, but consulting might actually give you the better skillset once you’re there. So my question: how tough is MBB → PE recruiting in reality?

EDIT: To clarify, I'm not asking whether or not IB or MBB provides better training for PE. I am just curious how PE recruiting is coming from MBB and how easy/difficult it is relative to tier 2/3 IB. It's a given that it won't be as good as tier 1 IB (PJT RX, GS top groups, MS M&A, etc.)",threeleggedmammal,1n876y0,consulting,04-09-2025,11:09:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1n876y0/mbb_to_pe/

EU partner track vs industry,"In a nutshell, I’m SM in a big4 in western eu. Team dynamic is pretty good and partner level seems close and supportive of each other from the outside. 

I am close to being promoted to director, which would take me another 5 to 6 years then to partner. I was about to leave but most of the partners are now trying to retain me as top talent, promising I have a really clear partner case ahead of me due to what I’m managing at the moment. 

I’ve always had this picture of the partner level as not something I want, but they’re giving me perspectives which are completely different than what I envisioned. I.e. much simpler to maintain and sustain (e.g. delivery partner). In my mind I never see myself not be burnt out at that level due to the repeating sales cycle and maintaining a healthy sales pipeline 24/7

Strongly hinted I won't make it past PIP. What next?,"I’ve been working in PE consulting/portfolio operations for about 8 months. Last month, my manager told me she was putting me on a 60-day PIP for three reasons:

* Lack of attention to detail: too many small errors on deliverables and slides
* Poor communication: not giving enough proactive updates on projects
* Professional maturity: taking feedback too personally and not showing a growth mindset

That news hit me hard. This is only my second job since graduating a couple years ago, and my first ended in a layoff that left me with a bad impression of that company. I came into this role determined to prove myself, but with the nature of PE—juggling a portfolio of 80+ companies—I never had a chance to settle into one area where I could really shine.

Another frustration is that the role was sold as portfolio data analytics, but in reality I spend most of my time acting as a gatekeeper for quarterly finance and headcount data. To make things more complicated, my manager went on maternity leave a month after I started and only recently came back. Two weeks later, she put me on the PIP. I assume much of that decision came from peer feedback. I wanted to question the validity of it, but I knew pushing back too hard could just reinforce the “maturity” criticism.

I had my halfway check-in today. She told me I’ve improved on communication and maturity, but I’m still getting constant “pls fix” comments on my deliverables. The tone got a little dark, she said I’m probably not a great fit for the role because of the attention-to-detail issue. I can’t deny I’ve made errors, but the anxiety of messing up has me quintuple-checking everything, which only makes me more prone to mistakes. She’s probably right, all things considered, but it still stings that it’s not really my decision to make.

Right now I just feel drained. I’m angry at myself, angry at the situation, and angry at my employer. It’s exhausting to feel this way, especially since I thought I was finally in a place where I could build momentum. I’ve been applying to other roles with some success, but the disappointment is hard to shake.

Has anyone else gone through something similar early in their career? How did you handle it, and what helped you move forward? I'm planning on therapy, but would curious what the corporate world here has to say.

EDIT: Sorry I didn't make it clear: I understand what a PIP means beneath the surface and have been applying to other roles. I'm more so asking for general advice on how to handle it emotionally and mindset-wise.

  
EDIT 2 MONTHS LATER: Got an offer and jumped ship a week before my PIP was up! Now at a tech firm with a much better approach to data analysis/engineering. Super satisfying to leave on own terms and move on. New manager doesn't give the impression that they'd pull this kind of BS, either.

What do you think about the BCG-affiliated GREAT Trust?,"  
The 38-page proposal, known as the Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration and Transformation Trust, or GREAT Trust, is modeled on President Donald Trump’s pledge to “take over” Gaza and oversee it for at least 10 years while turning it into a high-tech and industrial center and a luxury tourist destination.

According to The Washington Post, the GREAT Trust was developed by some of the same Israelis who created the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which currently distributes food in Gaza under U.S. and Israeli supervision. Financial planning was conducted by a team formerly with the Boston Consulting Group. The White House declined to comment on the report, and BCG said the work was not officially approved, with two senior partners responsible for the financial model later dismissed.

The plan calls for the temporary relocation of Gaza’s more than 2 million residents, either through voluntary departures to another country or into secured zones within the enclave during reconstruction. Landowners would receive “digital tokens” in exchange for redevelopment rights, which could finance new lives elsewhere or be redeemed for apartments in six to eight planned AI-powered “smart cities” inside Gaza.",Old-School8916,1n4xmmd,consulting,31-08-2025,15:27:20,https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjk007h11cgx

Pivoting from Consulting to Finance when you already have an MBA?,"I’m a Senior Consultant at a tech consulting firm, currently on a strategy project. It’s become clear this isn’t the path I want long-term, and I’d like to move back toward finance.

Background:

- BS in Finance (Big 10)
- 4 years in Big Four consulting
- MBA (M7) FYI I did not attend Wharton
- MBA internship: corporate finance rotational program at Citibank (received return offer, but declined due to numerous factors that were valid before the job market went to the gutter)
- Spent ~1.5 years post-MBA trying to break into fintech, but market was trash
- Ended up back in consulting since interviews came easier and I needed stability

Current situation:
I feel like I’m not building transferable skills in consulting and want to reposition myself for a finance role. I’ve been considering an 8-week FP&A course at Wharton (via Wall Street Prep) as a way to strengthen my profile, then aiming for a Senior Associate FP&A role to build skills and grow internally.

Is the FP&A course actually helpful for someone with an MBA, or is it unnecessary?

Pros/cons of targeting FP&A as a pivot point given my background

Other finance entry points that might make more sense (corporate development, strategy/ops at a financial institution, etc.)

How best to leverage the MBA at this stage — is there still a path into front-office finance, or should I reset expectations and build up from FP&A?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s navigated a similar pivot or has perspective on how realistic this path is.

What is the best practice to work with raw client data which will need to be updated several times in the coming months?,"Dear consulting colleagues,

Imagine you get an employee list from the client (extracted from multiple HR systems) which has errors and missing data. The client is asking HR in each country to double check the extration data to make it complete and error-free. This processs could take weeks. What is the best practice to start working on your analysis with raw data that is still going to change?

I was thinking to:

* Tab 1: raw data extracts, which I can copy paste over when new data comes in.
* Tab 2: Same layout as the raw data (colums) and unique identifiers of the employees but keep everything else empty. Here, I can add values that should be used instead of the values from the raw data extract. E.g., employee 000005 department should be Sales instead of HR, so I fill in Sales in this tab, keep everything else empty
* Tab 3: 'updated raw data' which copies all the raw data from Tab 1 except if there is a value found in Tab 2, then take the value from Tab 2.

This way, I can edit the raw data as needed without changing it. And as better data extracts come in, I can just copy paste that in without overwriting or losing all the manual edits.

Is this best practice or are there better ways to do it?

How do you transition into a chief strategy officer of a bank?,"I’ve seen a director of Strategy&, who was a mechanical engineer before doing MBA at London Business School, move into a big bank as a Group Chief Strategy Officer and then got promoted to be Group Chief Strategy & Transformation Officer. 

When I watched their interviews, the way they speak is obviously regurgitating whatever it is that has been written online. In other words, they are jargon spouting which sounds incredibly deep and profound but never hits on any points at all. 

For instance, they would talk about digital transformation across the retail bank, GenAI in investment bank, customer experience in commercial bank, etc. There are other consultants who have never worked in the banking industry yet they became a banking CEO.

Reply is forcing everyone back to the office in September – just a strategy to make us quit?,"Hi guys, the consulting holding company Reply is forcing everyone back to the office starting in September. In particular, the Rome offices are requiring only employees from Campania and Rome to return, without giving us any explanation.

At the beginning of August, they sent us an email saying that starting in September we all have to go back to the office. Does this sound normal to you? Everyone knows how hard it is to even find a single room in Rome, and they drop this news in August, after telling us verbally that we could work full remote.

This doesn’t feel fair to us employees. They know exactly what they’re doing: many people will be forced to resign. That way, they don’t have to pay severance, they don’t look “bad” for laying people off, and we don’t even get unemployment benefits. Honestly, it feels like one of the dirtiest strategies a company can pull.

Think about people who have been working remotely for years, bought a house, started a family… and now they’re forced to resign because the company doesn’t want to take responsibility for layoffs. To me, Reply is a huge red flag as a company. They promise you the world, but at the end of the day it’s just empty words. Our mistake was trusting their “full remote” promise without having it in writing in the contract.

I really hope there will be laws protecting workers from this, because more and more companies — Amazon included — are ending remote work just to push people to quit on their own.

Since they gave us this news a month ago, many of my colleagues and I have already started sending out CVs. Personally, I’m looking abroad, where remote work is clearly written into contracts and better protected. Because let’s be honest: even with a €2,000 salary in Rome, you can’t live decently. A room is at least €550, food €300–400, going out with friends €200–300, and you can’t even think of buying a car on installments because you can’t save anything.

Sorry for the rant, but I’m really frustrated. And let’s not even get into the “Rome and Campania employees first back to the office” part. What does that even mean? Just because I was born in Campania I have to lose money, while others don’t?

Questions for you:
	•	Do you think this is even legal for a company to do?
	•	Is this a strategy used by other big companies to push people to resign?
	•	What would you do if you were in our shoes?
	•	Is it better to stay and see how it plays out or quit right away and look elsewhere?",Godenless,1mz2eec,consulting,24-08-2025,17:51:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1mz2eec/reply_is_forcing_everyone_back_to_the_office_in/

I’m wondering if I should suck it up for another 6 months and last at least a year (previous job ended rather soon as well so I’m wary of resigning early). 

I’m at the SM level. Savings will last me a few years- and I have a supportive wife as well. The business plan is to open a diabetic friendly dessert store- have made some progress here.

Are consultancies actually using AI tools?,"I work at a  boutique firm who recently hired a few contractors to build a AI ppt generator and knowledge management system (to get case studies and prior proposals easier). The CEO had a mandated all hands company meeting to basically demand that we all deploy these tools.

The general sentiment in the session was that all other consultancies are using AI tools but from the consultants I've spoken to the extent of tool usage is ChatGPT to rewrite emails or paras. Anyway, I used the AI tools deployed last week and suffice to say, they aren't great. Partners keep pushing them but the ppt's developed are completely poorly formatted. I was managing the bench last week and asked an experienced analyst to create a proposal, they responded with a first draft in 2 hours. I opened the deck and I think my eyes were bleeding. Completely wrong format, completely made up data, em dashes galore - they used the tool. To be fair, they are doing what all Partners are telling us to do but I feel like this is creating more work for me and the team - not less

From consulting to Deputy CIO – what should I expect in my first 100 days?,"Hi everyone,

I’d love to get your advice and hear about your experiences.

Quick background:

• 5 years as a project manager in a CIO office during a major transformation.

• 5 years in a boutique IT strategy firm (roadmaps aligning business & tech, strategic project framing for orgs from 10k to 200k employees, audits of critical programs, working with C-suite). Progressed from consultant → senior consultant → manager.

• 18 months in the “strategy” arm of a big IT services company as a senior manager (worst career chapter: low-level clients, low-level projects, consultants and partners mostly unhappy, heavy internal processes, dumb KPIs, horrible tools… but hey, it’s behind me 😂).

Now I’m moving industry side as Deputy CIO in a financial services company under LBO (and yes, +30% pay 💵💵).

Main missions ahead:

• Modernizing the IT function.

• Implementing solid governance.

• Optimizing budget.

• Building a data & AI team.

• …and plenty more.

I’m expecting a slower pace than consulting (fewer “magic hours” between 9pm–2am…), and I know I’ll need to be more patient with teams in the short term.

But beyond that—

• What are the main risks I should watch out for?

• What surprises did you face when moving from consulting to an industry leadership role?

• Any tips for managing the first 100 days effectively?

• How do you balance quick wins vs. long-term transformation?

I’d really appreciate your insights, stories, and hard-earned lessons.

"Big 4 Manager: Torn between delivery and nonstop proposals. How do you prioritize, push back, and still progress?","
Post Manager-level at a Big 4 consulting in Canada. Market is rough and top line is everything. The promotion ladder feels stalled, and Directors/Senior Managers are pushing hard on BD. The team is too heavy and the pyramid is inverted. The result: managers like me are getting delegated a ton of proposal work while also being responsible for delivery and team management.

What this looks like
	•	Juggling multiple RFPs/proposals across different leaders while owning day-to-day delivery on an active project
	•	Utilization targets haven’t changed, but proposal time often isn’t chargeable
	•	Proposal hit rate is low, but the volume and urgency are high
	•	Conflicting priorities from multiple senior stakeholders; no clear go/no-go discipline
	•	Long weeks and burnout risk, plus fear of being labeled “not a team player” if I push back
Impact on me
	•	Delivery quality/time at risk because proposal spikes are unpredictable
	•	Hard to make the case for promotion: I’m told to “sell more” but don’t get clear credit for proposal work, and utilization metrics don’t reflect BD time
	•	I’m worried about missing both delivery expectations and BD expectations at the same time

My questions for the sub
	•	How do you set boundaries without getting labeled difficult? Any scripts that work?
	•	If I can’t fix it, what are the signs that I should jump ship?

Stuck on the bench and it's getting frustrating,"So, I started off pretty strong at my company with my first project with nearly 100% utilization, and I even got a raise in my first year. Then client budget cuts hit, the project got canned, and I’ve been benched ever since.

It’s been over three months now. At first, my manager said: “Don’t worry, just a couple of weeks and we’ll get you staffed again.” Fast forward three months later and there's still nothing. No projects in sight, no interviews, just “wait a little longer.”

In the meantime, I’ve updated my profile multiple times, knocked out a few certifications, and tried to stay proactive. But honestly, how am I supposed to get hands-on experience if I’m stuck on the bench the whole time? Every project that comes in seems to require \[insert some tech I haven’t had any experience with\]. I still handed-in my profile, but wasn't staffed. I can’t exactly get “real project experience” without actually being on one.

I mean, yeah, I’m thankful for the paycheck, but career-wise I feel completely stuck. I have no idea how to advance, no clue what the actual expectations are, and honestly, if layoffs happen, I’m pretty sure I’ll be one of the first to go. Luckily, labor laws are strong here, but I’m still sure I’ll get replaced at some point.

I’ve had a 1:1 with my manager. Even before being hired, I raised concerns that the role might be too junior, but he was confident I’d thrive in the project they had lined up for me and I really enjoyed it. Now, after being on the bench for so long, I’ve been looking for solutions, like going part-time for a while to reduce overhead. I’m not looking for a project where I’ll change the world just something to get the dust off after this long stretch without any billable hours.

I’ve read the advice here: keep doing trainings, keep applying, keep pushing. It’s the market. But I really like the workplace. It’s close to where I live, with good, if not excellent conditions, plus full remote. I’m not in it for the career ladder or six-figure salary. I just want an average lifestyle where I can switch off after work is done, and this job seemed to offer exactly that. 

**TL;DR:** Started strong at my company, got a raise, then project got cut and I’ve been benched for 3+ months. Manager keeps saying “soon,” but nothing yet. I’m doing trainings/certs to stay proactive, but can’t get real experience without projects. I like the workplace (remote, good conditions, not chasing big money), but I feel stuck, unsure how to advance, and worried I’ll be first out if layoffs hit.",Pristine_Software860,1mvd4b2,consulting,20-08-2025,12:15:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1mvd4b2/stuck_on_the_bench_and_its_getting_frustrating/

Leaving the way I did really knocked my confidence and has drastically fuelled my imposter syndrome, especially combined with moving back to my home country without a role to land to and being on the job market for a long time (~8+ months, fairly normal in my geo). 

I finally transitioned into a corporate strategy / bizops role ~2 months ago in the travel industry, but I’m still struggling to find my feet. My new boss is lovely, and very supportive - and to be clear, I do not miss the intensity and weird vibes of some of my nastier teams - but I’m struggling with the ambiguity of my new role. I’m very mindful of the consequences of recommending stupid decisions within a context where  I will actually be listened to, and while my new org has a tonne of potential, it also it feels like we could be a few wrong moves away from sinking the company. 

I know logically these people wouldn’t have hired me if they didn’t believe I could nail it - but has anyone else struggled with the transition out of consulting? What’s helped you in the past?

Quit MBB after 7 months for a startup?,"**Context:**  I’m 26 with 3 years of in-house management consulting experience, and about 6 months ago I landed a second level consulting role at an MBB firm, something I’ve been dreaming of since undergrad. The problem is, I hate it. I’m constantly stressed, exhausted, and nervous about work. I thought I could handle it but i dont see the point of doing so. I’ve spoken to others at the firm and while most people feel the same way, they’re willing to endure it for a few years. I just can’t see myself doing that.

A few weeks ago, I started applying elsewhere and ended up getting an offer from a really exciting startup that’s working on something super niche and innovative. It feels much more aligned with what I actually want to do. The catch is that I’d be leaving MBB after only 7 months, I’d take a 30% pay cut (also because i would be moving back to my home country), and I’m nervous about how this might look and affect for my career in the long run. On the other hand, the startup role seems exciting, healthier, and could give me back some balance in my life.

**Question**: For those who’ve been in a similar situation did you decide to leave early, and if so, do you regret it? Or was it worth it in the long term?

When to leave/how to leave,"I’ve been at a T2 consulting firm for close to 15 years. First 10 years were golden. Things declined rapidly in the last 5 years but even more so in the last year. 6 managers and I am no one’s favorite (my manager retired). Benched most of the time. Best friend at work negotiated a mutual exit. Managers are very problematic to say the least. Just got a negative review due to low utilization (not work product related). I see the writing on the wall but job market sucks. Resume done and applications sent daily. 
Big IF but IF I do get an offer, for way less pay, it is obvious I should leave, right? (Aiming for industry,9-5). Just need some words of comfort. Haha",ans678,1mt39m2,consulting,17-08-2025,21:31:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1mt39m2/when_to_leavehow_to_leave/
I am a Fraud,"I’m writing this with great sadness, honestly, but I need to get this off my chest and hear different points of view on my issue.

I’ve been in a T2 consulting firm for the past 5.6 years, fresh out of uni. The feedback I get on my projects is always very positive, and I’m generally well-liked by peers and managers.

But one huge issue is that I can’t shake the feeling that I’m a fraud and don’t truly belong in this industry. For starters, I’ve been at consultant level for nearly 3 years now and still haven’t been promoted to manager, and that only reinforces the thought.

Second I SUCK at math. Especially mental math. I get so nervous on calls when numbers come up, terrified someone will ask me something that requires a quick calculation and I’ll look like a complete fraud.

I’ve tried to fight this. At one point, I was improving, and then McKinsey reached out. I went through the process, barely scraped by the first round due to my weak math, but I still passed. I even made it to the final interview… and then got rejected.

That hit me hard. It made the “fraud” thought dig in even deeper. Now I’m scared of trying for another firm since I’m not getting promoted here. Worried I’ll just face another harsh rejection.

I even just purchased a Udemy MBB 101 course to sharpen my case interview skills and mental math, just in case another opportunity comes up.

But I keep asking myself: am I really a fraud who just got this job by luck? Is it only a matter of time before people realize and I get laid off? despite all the recognition and positive feedback I’ve received?",tempr333,1mt2tn5,consulting,17-08-2025,21:13:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1mt2tn5/i_am_a_fraud/
How to persuade the arrogant,"I work at a consulting firm and I have gotten every client I interviewed until recently . I’m a cyber security/ devops cloud consultant and from a technical perspective I know my domain really well.

Last week I was interviewing as a consultant for an Ivy League college. I nailed the technical component but the interviewer was most worried how I would handle the office politics and be persuasive.

The clients team responsible for security across the entire university but specific colleges and departments had their own bosses and we could not enforce recommendations for different departments only recommend. In other words I word have no formal authority or do anything and I would get second guessed at every suggestion.

To make matters more complicated I was told faculty and admin staff had very large egos and would grill anyone new and argue with consultants and poke holes in ideas as an ego power trip.

I still consider myself persuasive but I have ptsd and I take a medication that lowers verbal recall ability. So when I speak and present I come off as more mechanical. 

Most people don’t notice and wouldn’t know if I didn’t tell them but it interferes in verbal debates where speed of recall for vocabulary matters. My written skills are great and I did a lot of debate in HS+ college but after dramatic events in my life and medication I am slower at rebuttal of adhoc debates than I use to.

In the interview I gave answers about leading with questions, listening, having multiple recommendations , coming prepared for counter arguments, etc. This was the first client I have not landed and it came down the client was worried if I would be persuasive enough. 

I had a similar problem at a startup I worked for several years ago. I would present a recommendation and every two sentences I would get  interrupted so I could never finish explaining an idea. It was usually by my manager or staff engineers who would nitpick a certain point about a product or architecture I was recommending. I couldn’t fully explain an idea and talk about pros and cons because I couldn’t finish a sentence.

The startup had a cliche group of people who worked together for sometime and most had attended elite colleges and were extremely wealthy. To make matters more complicated cybersecurity was always deprioritized because it did not increase the bottom line in the short term and the founders started lying about compliance rather than let me implement controls (at which point I left).


The people interrupting me usually went to Ivy or ivy adjacent schools like Harvard, Princeton, Cornell, Stanford, or even the Navy academy.

I wondering if it’s my education background because I went to an average state college and it’s a prestigious education vibe.

How to ask not to work with resource without impacting my colleagues,"Hi all

I have been working as PM for the last year and has as a senior consultant, I usually work with the same senior consultant that my partner pair us with
Lately I secured a new project and I communicated to the partner that i will be working on it alone, however he want to include the other senior consultant on the project as he has no other possible staffing opportunities. 
I don't want to work with his as I had a constant unpleasant expirence
My issue with the resource is that he always do things the bare minimum, I always end up completing or fixing things, he is unable to take the lead on a work stream and deliver solid content, we work projects in specific area and he despite working multiple times on similar projects didn't update his knowledge.
His only part of the project is making slide and waiting for the content to be provided by me
I worked multiple times with him and I prefer not to do it again

I don't want to be the bad guy telling the partner I don't want to work with him and at the same time I don't want to end up carrying the entire wait of the project

Career advice for a mid 40s consultant in financial services who is currently on  career break,"So, I am in my mid 40s based in Europe and I have worked in Banking for the past 15 years.  My projects have been in capital markets, trading systems dealing with derivatives (a class of financial products traded by big financial institutions).  The projects have covered all phases of the project lifecycle from conceptual planning, to solution design to implementation and even testing (all functional/business).   I was with a large well known consultancy until a few years ago and then I started freelancing after being let go.

I am currently going through a career break (1.5 years) due to health and family issues and I am thinking of what I should do next.  The projects in the banking sector are declining and companies are refraining from hiring too many consultants.  My aim is to not aim for the highest paying positions but **career stability and longevity.**  

Since I have some free time right now I am looking to learn more about what I should do next.  The career options that I have see before me are as follows: 

* Stay in the Financial Services consulting business and join another consultancy and try to specialize. If you are familiar with Financial Services consulting then what should I specialized in?
* Get into another type of consulting like SAP or Salesforce or something else. (don't know what else could I do, suggestions are welcome).  Does SAP have something for capital markets?  
* Become a Quant. I will need some more math training (differential equations and stochastic calculus)) and I might be in my late 40s by then.
* Get into Data Engineering since the field seems to be growing right now and seems to be more open to people who are slightly older.
* Get into Data Science/ ML / AI (what has been your experience with DS / ML in consulting?)

What would be your advice to someone else in my situation, what career options should I pursue to continue working.

So much incompetence - again doing all the work.,"Long story short - 80% of my colleagues are lazy and useless. Culture is awful, so many layoffs, so have to suck it up for now. Pay is c.10% above average industry rates, as I joined consulting after 25 years in industry 18 months ago. 

Just delivered an exceptional 300 page report to a regulator. It was a nightmare, thanks to a psychotic partner and co-worker who did little. However, couldn't lose face to the regulator, so dug deep and delivered.

How do you structure data science within consulting?,"I come from a data science background (not a traditional DS training but pivoted in a few years ago from STEM). I've been at a small-ish consulting firm (think 50-100 people range) doing mostly glorified analyst work that coding and automation and clever dataviz seems to be in short supply for. We have shit and/or no data infrastructure. Clients email or use SharePoint to give us data, or we get it ourselves ad hoc and keep it long enough for me to python whatever I need from it.

My performance evals are strong but I literally don't know what title or role I'm supposed to be working toward. The other day, my boss asked me if I would like a title that emphasized ""consultant"" and less ""data science."" this surprised me, and I declined saying nah I'm a data scientist and plan on keeping up my skill set. Respectfully, why the fuck would I want to DE emphasize my data focus? Why would my boss have even hinted at this as a possibility? Maybe data science is no longer as sexy or valuable to this firm as I think it is? It seems my leadership has zero idea what data science is beyond a way to retroactively add perception of legitimacy to AI powered slides and ""insights.""

Anyway. Do you have a data science function embedded in your consulting firms? What is their structure like?

Is Corporate America so ruthless?,"I work in a renowned economic consulting firm and I feel I have time to breathe. I started working as an analyst 2 years ago after graduating and it has been non-stop since then.
Firstly, everything is about utilization. They make you compete with your peers for who gets more utilization but offer no staffing help. PTO is not accounted for in your utilization. Basically, makes you feel like any moment you are not working you are falling behind. You are then expected to be staffed across 2-4 cases at one time, which is tiring having to context switch your mind 10 times a day.
Secondly, every deadline is urgent. Having lawyers as clients is stressful as everyday I am handed tasks which are due either ASAP or EOD. It is exhausting mentally and never ending. It also always your fault if you can’t manage deadlines. I barely sleep, my health is deteriorating and I can’t do anything about it as if I stop working my managers and VP are on my ass. I had a sudden death in my family and I couldn’t even pause to process it as I was constantly putting in 14-15 hour days. 
And weekends, if a request comes in you have to address it ASAP. I feel my VPs are trying to ensure the clients aka the lawyers stay and overwork analysts to give them extra work ASAP so they can impress them.
And yeah, if there ever is any mistake in your work. You are pretty doomed. And by mistake it could be the smallest thing, maybe you forgot to convert a number to a percentage.
It is just unrelenting and non-stop competition. How do you keep up? How do you guys manage?

Life outside AI-IT-bubble,"In my little info bubble, it feels like for the past year or so everyone’s been talking about AI, fancy automations, and agents. And they all seem to “get it.”

But the reality outside my bubble is different.  
I recently took on a small dental clinic. Good reputation, great doctors, modern tech. They want to use automation to bring in more clients. (Probably the most common “first goal” everyone tries to automate.)

Turns out, they record patients' info on paper. Because that’s what the law says and, well, old habits die hard. No CRM, no single database. Contacts live in dentists’ phones, appointments get booked via private WhatsApp messages.  
“Disappointed, but not surprised,” as my daughters would say.

So, \~80% of our first consultation was me explaining why, before automating, they have to at least tidy up the patients' data in digital form and formalize even the simplest processes - what info about patients we write down, who’s responsible for what, where we store it.  
Then, we sent the doctors off to copy contacts from paper cards and phones into a shared table.

From there, the first steps of automation are easy: set up automated online booking, auto-reminders, feedback, and “auto-touch” follow-ups with patients.

Funny: their professional software is actually quite advanced - X-rays, scanners, lab analysis tools, even some kind of 3D modeling for prosthetics.

What do you guys think of the study floating around that claims Blackstone buying and renting properties reduces rents relative to areas without their presence?,"My thought is it's a short-term trend to help give PE groups like Blackstone larger market share long-term.

There is no long-term data to suggest the price reductions will remain over the long-term (and I think this is a major weakness of said study). If anything, my expectation would be that once BS has larger market share of a particular region, they will jack up the prices significantly since they have a monopolistic-esque control of that region's rental supply.

It's very similar to Amazon's business model (or any other VC-funded product). They'll undercut profits in the short term to price out competition, establish a consistent user base, and seize more market share. Once the product is seen as a real essential (or huge inconvenience to not have) by a large enough consumer base is when they start jacking up prices.

My expectation is that groups like Blackstone are likely looking to drive a similar strategy by reducing rents short-term.

What do you guys think?

Potential employer can’t commit to role being permanent FTE…red flag?,"I’ve been in federal consulting for 14 years, the past six of which I’ve been with my small firm. Given the current political climate, I’m looking to exit from fed consulting. I recently had an interview with a similarly sized firm that focuses on private sector clients. The recruiter told me that she’s not sure if the role would be permanent or temporary full time; meaning that after this specific engagement ended, they couldn’t guarantee they’d keep me on. When I pressed on why this was, the recruiter stated that “since I’m not a known entity to them, this is pretty common for new employees, and there’s some risk involved.” She added that it’s not typical for them to “bend the rules and let outside hires make demands” and that if I did well in my role, I’d be very likely converted to permanent full time.

Now I’m very familiar with how the bench works, and I know that there’s no guarantee that after the engagement ended and I’m on the bench for a few months that I wouldn’t get let go anyways, but something about this situation rubs me the wrong way. Yes, I see her point (to an extent) that they can’t bend the rules for outside hires, and yes, this isn’t a c suite (or even director level role)… but at the same time, it’s not like this is my first role out of undergrad and I should take whatever I can get; I do come with experience, and the recruiter even said that among the three other candidate, the HM liked my profile the best. This company isn’t a known entity to me either and there’s some risk on my end too; I’m leaving a company that I’ve been with for six years. Similarly, it’s not like this new role is with a Big 4 shop where the name value is worth the extra risk.

Is it me or the industry? How to think about next steps?,"Need support with:

- How to set myself up for success, manager role, given my history (see below) 
- When would it be appropriate to ask to switch industry (now, later or never)?
- Should I start planning the exit already? If so, how to setup for this?


History (Bottom up):

- Energy Engineer for 5 years (didn't like it much)
- Pivoted into strategy consulting via M7 MBA during COVID but hiring was a challenge 
- Went into in-house consulting for a utility as a SC;  fired in 6 months. Vague feedback - not structured, can't solve problems, not top down. Was happy to improve, do anything but they wanted to cut their losses. Fair enough.
- Went to tier 2 firm as a SC in energy team - PIP'd in 1.5 years didn't make it to manager. Feedback: not progressing fast enough, toolkit not developed, can't model. I asked for training 12 times! But due to utilisation targets it was all on the job in low resourced projects, so I barely kept up and was burnt out. Anyway, I figured I am the problem and not the firms. So....
- Took up an exec strategy role at a startup. Let go in 6 months - (Why? AI does strategy now) 

- Next: Secured a manager role at a top tier firm - How do I make the most of it? I am excited but also dreading it.

Concerns/Musings:

- No prior management experience (was a PM in engineering though)
- I feel I am terrible consultant/employee having been let go thrice
- Fundamentally, I am not very passionate about energy (apart from few niche topics) but like tech and being hired in an energy role, I am not sure if it's possible to pivot into tech at my level 


- Exit (voluntary or forced), how to set myself up for the options: search fund, startup, or an exec role at a corporate. 
- Or I just need to take a big step back, get some career coaching and figure out what to do with skills I have",uaeObjective9778,1mm83fz,consulting,10-08-2025,03:20:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1mm83fz/is_it_me_or_the_industry_how_to_think_about_next/
How do you staff projects and project capacity?,"My consultancy holds regular meetings where project leads and managers manually adjust and discuss chronically stale spreadsheets of manager projections of IC assignments by week to projects. There's about 20 tabs to this spreadsheet, zero version control, zero accuracy metrics or retrospective evaluation of how good our projections turned out, or which people have been recently tracking high or low, it's just pure vibes and next 2-3 weeks most of the time. This feels like a textbook example of painful processes arising from the unmatched visibility and user experience of the humble spreadsheet.

Is there a better way or do I suck this up and keep my head down and just Teams my boss my own weekly estimate of project allocation? What process or software do your companies use to do this kind of stuff? Every time I hear about or get added to our allocation meetings and see the spreadsheet vibes in action I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.",MentionedBDSMTooSoon,1mm514r,consulting,10-08-2025,00:45:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1mm514r/how_do_you_staff_projects_and_project_capacity/
15 vs 30 minute billing increments,What do you follow and what is your firms policy?

I got out! (from 7+ years of consulting to back in house),"In 2019, I had a brilliant idea to go out on my own and consult. I figured I had been an in-house gun slinger long enough that I wanted the majority of my hourly wage in my pocket. 2019 was great (lots of companies wanting consultants and willing to pay high), and I began to shape my approach to having 2-3 small (15-20hr per week) engagements versus one massive client. If I lost or reduced a client the hours were easy to pick up.   
  
Fast forward to March of 2020, and the world burned down. I mistakenly took a role with a dumpster fire of a manufacturer (basically, my job was to hide that they were where they had told their clients they were in terms of completion). Went right back to consulting and just continued - as we emerged from COVID the demand was there but the pay had been reduced (at least what my clients were able/willing to pay). 

I recognized burnout in myself about 8 months back and made the decision to wrap up and find something fulltime, in-house etc.... 

Yesterday I signed an offer to manage a team of ten in a fin/tech space. I know a little about what the team does technically but the organization came to me for my 'Ted Lasso' approach to leadership. I have cash in the bank and will enjoy the next few weeks of downtime with my family and looking forward to my start date.

How Do I Better Develop the Consulting Toolkit,"Hi all posted yesterday too about my experience but this more of a general question.

I'm someone who has struggled to really be a self starter in the workplace, and this flaw is exposing itself in consulting. Throw in the fact that my manager it seems almost never likes the slide I build or always throws it out and builds their own and provides relative feedback, or comes at me for some simply relative detail. And additionally, even when I feel like I have a valid point as to why I designed a slide or model I did on the first pass, they don't care and I'm overruled. It's quite exasperating.

Getting feedback that I need to be more of a self-starter but I literally show up to every call with a slide or some Excel ready and its never enough. Like where the hell is the guidance? Is this really the experience. Atleast in my first few months, would expect some shadowing or some ghosting of slides because clearly you don't like whatever I do so please show me hows it done then but that can't happen either.

But those of you who made it to manager and then to associate partner, how did you develop the consulting toolkit? How did you earn the trust of your manager? How do you learn to think about the ""so what"" in an industry you know next to nothing about? Is there anything I can do or any recommendations you have I want to improve and be a better employee and I really don't want to feel so incompetent and useless.",Happy-Ad3503,1ml6rpz,consulting,08-08-2025,20:54:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1ml6rpz/how_do_i_better_develop_the_consulting_toolkit/
Are your travel hours tracked or reported at all?,"Im starting to find it really weird and not right that people at my (smaller boutique) consulting company dont log their travel time. Now, I wouldnt expect the hours to be ""billable,"" butI think knowing how much someone travels for work should be something that a company would want to know.

But most of my coworkers just dont log their travel at all, and management has more or less taken the stance of ""eh, just dont log travel time."" My issue with it is that bonuses/promotions/etc etc is all based around metrics about ""how hard you work,"" and without logging travel, on paper (and at bonus time,) the person who traveled every week to be onsite looks the exact same as the person who worked remote the entire time

Transition from Big 4 (Consulting) to Meta,"Posting for a friend


Currently a Manager (Ops Strategy) at Big 4 in Denver. Just got an offer from Meta for a similar role — Biz Ops Strategy Manager. The total comp at Meta is about 25% higher, mostly because of RSUs. Base salary is actually a touch lower. The role itself is pretty much what he’s already doing for another tech client.


Everyone on Blind is warning him against taking the offer. A lot of people say Meta has become a PIP factory with a high-pressure, up-or-out culture. Sounds like people there are more focused on getting good reviews and avoiding PIPs than actually doing meaningful work. Some even mentioned there’s a lot of backstabbing and politics.


He’s coming from consulting, so he’s no stranger to all of this. But still wondering if it’s worth it.


The Meta job is 3 days a week in office. The pay bump isn’t life changing. He has a young kid now, so lifestyle and stability matter more. On the other hand, Meta on the resume does carry significant weight. He eventually wants to transition to industry as he doesn’t see himself in consulting longer term. 


At his current job, things are pretty chill though. He’s well respected, has a strong relationship with the client, and there’s a clear path to Senior Manager by end of year or early next year.",FrugalAsYourGrandma,1mkx69b,consulting,08-08-2025,14:46:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1mkx69b/transition_from_big_4_consulting_to_meta/

AI / Agentic AI in Consulting industry,"Looking for some real life experience here. 

I've read a gazillion articles and blog spots on how AI / Agentic AI means the end of traditional consulting and other similar predictions. In real life, I'm not seeing much. 

Typical example is something like this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1mfurx8/ai\_is\_coming\_for\_the\_consultants\_inside\_mckinsey/](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1mfurx8/ai_is_coming_for_the_consultants_inside_mckinsey/)

where the headline is ""*AI is coming for consultants*"" but when you read the article, the ""AI"" is just basically summarizing text and creating simple PPTs and other menial tasks. This is not replacing anyone (yet). 

Now obviously tech will evolve and become more capable but I want to hear from REAL LIFE experiences on how are consultancies using the new wave of AI / Gen AI / Agentic AI to change the way they deliver services. 

I'm not interested in predictions or hear say or assumptions. What new tech HAVE YOU seen implemented that is actively replacing consultants? How is your organisation planning to change to adapt to use the tech. 

I'll start:

* Best / most transformational I've seen are coding assistants. They save A LOT of time. They really can accelerate the work. However, we have not replaced anyone yet because of this. We're assuming a higher efficiency when planning work, but we're not going to let anyone go. 
* Something else I've seen are Globant ""AI Pods"" which is a new product they sell. Effectively they sell virtual project development teams which are supported by human but the virtual teams are supposed to do most of the work. In reality I dont know how much they are selling this product, or how effective it is. I'm guessing its mostly marketing but happy to be proven wrong. 
* Text summarization / writing / testing etc are also useful but I'm not letting anyone go because of the productivities introduced by these tools.

The way I see consulting (at least tech consulting) going is that the current teams will be augmented more and more with AI tools, but this will result only in productivity gains, not really massive replacement of roles. If the project is big enough, then 10 developers might turn into 6 developers and 10 testers into 5 or 4 but I dont see (yet) the rest of the roles being affected much. 

So, what are you seeing? Are companies moving to Fixed Price deals? How are you factoring the AI-delivered component into pricing? Are PMs being replaced by AI?

Question about hierarchy,"I'm only 18 months  into consulting with a boutique outfit, after 25 years in industry, so would appreciate thoughts.

Question: are all consultancy firms madly hierarchical?

For example, the Partner just wants to hear from the level below, even when they don't know what they're talking about. They won't permit client meetings without the Partner, which makes it ridiculously hard across timezones. Neither the Partner nor the MD are experts in this particular field. 

I'm used to taking the lead on behalf of my past bosses, so I find this hard. It also stifles the juniors. Is this unique to my firm?

At a crossroad,"I am a partner, mid 40s with 3 young kids. I'm pretty hands on with the kids, so have been working a lot less than I used to. Consequently the leadership isn't happy and would prefer I either step it up or leave. Fair. 

Stepping up isn't ideal. I'm willing to sacrifice time with the kids to some degree if I'm working on something I consider meaningful and interesting. The trouble is that while I was used to being a ""decider"" and got to choose what I worked on, that is no longer the case and there is a new leadership in town. I consider most of their recent decisions bad, and they are starting to show up in the financials. Rather than owning up to their mistakes, the leadership is blaming everyone else and either laying off people or putting the screws to employees. The messaging is that ""our strategy is perfect - you all need to execute better!"" I would rather not be in the position where I'm constantly pushing back against what I see as poor decision-making. Of course the pros of staying are the compensation, stability, routine, and health benefits.

The other path is starting my own thing. I have some ideas, and I come alive when I work on them. I feel like in my late 40s, this may be my last chance to strike out and pursue something that is truly my own. Thinking of some SaaS startup ideas that aren't heavy on capex and don't require me billing time. The cons are of course that most likely no income and small losses, and no health benefits.

I consider us financially independent. Our spend is unlikely to exceed 2-3% of my investments, so that is a sort of ""safe zone"" for early retirement.

Thoughts on 'family-friendly' projects and long-term career impact?,"Yeah, the ""mommy track"" is real and it's something I've been thinking about a lot lately. I work with women navigating career decisions in consulting, and I keep seeing this pattern where some of the women who make it to senior levels are the ones who somehow manage to take on challenging, visible work while still being present for their families but it's definitely not easy to figure out.

The tricky part is that when companies or your leaders offer local projects or reduced travel, it genuinely feels helpful in the moment. But I've seen situations where those assignments end up being lower-stakes work that doesn't really showcase what someone can do. It seems like having an honest conversation about long-term goals and what you actually need (rather than just accepting what's offered) could make a difference, but I imagine that's easier said than done.

Pivot from consulting to product management,"Hi everyone 

After about seven years in the consulting industry I’m considering a career switch to product management. My experience is mostly in the technical development of economics models for assessing the economic value of new pharmaceuticals across healthcare systems in the world. 

Although I think it’s a relevant job, and has a real world impact, the consulting aspect of it has become particularly exhausting for me. Workload is heavy, and I’m feeling constantly burn out and exhausted by work. With AI the value of technical skills has dropped massively and clients now see our work as something they would like to automate as much as it is possible. In this context, I see technology playing a crucial role, as domain knowledge would need to rely more and more on digitalisation to achieve increases in efficiency and automation. 

For those who have pivoted from technical consulting into product management, would you mind sharing your experience and motivations?

-How did you leveraged your experience as consultant to be able to make the switch? (E.g., through a certification or previous product experience while in consulting)
-What are the positives and negatives you have encountered in the role in comparison to a role in consulting?
-Did you experience a significant change in compensation?

Please feel free to share any other information you might consider relevant regarding your transition for us going through/considering doing the same

Presales Engineer - Need advice on up-skilling,"Hi Redditors,

I'm not exactly a technical person and I want to better myself as a presales consultant, sales engineer & Go To Market (GTM) consultant, especially at a time when the job market is tight due to layoffs and up-skilling is the way.

**What certifications can I take to upskill myself as a presales consultant and as a sales engineer** \- doesn't matter if it is domain knowledge or technical skills or even proposal drafting skills ? I am eager to learn

Background:

I am a presales consultant (part of solution design team) in the IT sector, who has mainly worked on the US Healthcare domain (payer & provider). 

I have worked as a presales consultant for BPO (outsourcing) and RPA (Robotic Process Automation) solutions and as a Sales Engineer & presales guy for AIML & Cloud solutions (Google Cloud Platform).

As a presales consultant in solution design, my work usually consists of-

* Bid management - Responding to RFPs/RFIs (requests for proposals)
* Needs analysis - Understand the needs of the customer during the initial discovery call
* Work on the solution design (with the architects/practice team) - This is where I consider myself weak. In the old days, there would usually be a separate Practice team whose solution architects would work on the solutioning. Nowadays, they expect presales and sales engineer to contribute to the solution building
* Proof of Concept creation - Same as previous point
* Estimate resource mix for the project
* Create solution / proposal decks, proposal writing, case studies
* Carry out the Pricing/commercial model of solutions / projects and come up with the project timeline (with the architects/practice team)
* Draft SOWs (statement of work)
* Market intelligence, client visits, calls with client

At the moment, I'm mainly googling or watching Youtube videos on tech like GenAI, CCAI, DocAI, etc. but I know that is not enough, especially when it comes to practical work like making an operating model of the solution or creating a POC of a solution.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.",Spargo1601,1mghat0,consulting,03-08-2025,11:50:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1mghat0/presales_engineer_need_advice_on_upskilling/
Consulting —> Data / Product Analytics vs Strategy & Operations in Product companies?,"Hey Reddit folks! 

I am currently a Strategy Consultant and thinking about next career steps and completely exiting out of consulting. I’ve done 3 years of management consulting mainly in digital transformation / strategy including delivery and strategy roles, but still feel like I lack the hard skills. 

 I’m torn between going down more of an analytics route vs ops route in my next job search - since I’d like to learn more analytical skills such as SQL, data visualisation, maybe some python to aid business analysis. I’d imagine analytics would be more of a product / data analyst role? 

I’d like to do some upskilling on the side and thinking of taking a course, I think that consulting is easier to break into operations so was thinking of looking for these roles, although I lack the analytical skills. 

What is the path like into operations from consulting and what is the career progression like vs analytics? 

Also any tips/ any courses to look into would be much appreciated, thank you! ",Skylightflower_07,1mgfuk4,consulting,03-08-2025,10:22:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1mgfuk4/consulting_data_product_analytics_vs_strategy/
Looking for advice on scaling an accidental consulting business,"I've held various technical roles throughout my career, from Software Developer to CTO. As I've moved between positions, former colleagues have consistently reached out for ad-hoc consulting work. Over the past year, these referrals have grown into a solid stream of recurring revenue through Fractional CTO and development engagements.

Without initially intending to build a business, I've essentially created a consulting practice focused on helping companies scale and manage their technical teams. The growth has been organic—built on my reputation from previous roles and word-of-mouth referrals.

Now I'm seeing real potential to scale beyond just myself. While I've been successful at ""selling myself"" based on past relationships and results, sales and marketing aren't my core strengths. I'm willing to learn, but I'm also exploring the possibility of bringing on commission-based sales reps to help test scaling strategies.

I'd appreciate any insights from others who've made or been a part of similar transitions or scaled technical consulting businesses. What worked for you?

How do you stay aligned when projects take over?,"Would love to get some perspectives from folks already working in consulting or those further along the journey.

I recently mapped out a personal strategy using a structured framework that covers goals, positioning, capabilities, and longer-term direction. It felt solid. But once the client work kicked in, I found myself defaulting to firefighting mode, jumping from engagement to engagement, trying to hit deadlines, and not really stepping back to assess if I’m staying aligned with that original strategy.

So here’s the question: how do you maintain alignment between your long-term strategic intent and the day-to-day execution, especially when you’re juggling multiple clients or deliverables? Do you track against specific KPIs? Block time for strategic reflection? Or just accept that chaos is part of the game and try to realign quarterly?

Asked to undercut prices to win a client. How to respond?," I was asked by senior management to provide a low ball estimate to win an RFP with a client.

This type of work normally takes 3 times long as we are quoting and the crazy thing is it will be staffed by part-time junior consultants.  The rationale is that we are expected to use AI to find efficiencies and improve productivity so work gets done faster. 

If I low ball and the project team can't deliver, we go over budget. If I give a realistic estimate we lose the deal, and I get canned.

Consulting -> IB / PE,"Hi everyone,

I’m a strategy consultant with 3 YOE at a T2 firm (e.g. LEK, EYP, S&) in London, primarily focused on M&A CDD and value creation for PE clients. I’m now looking to pivot into IB and PE, and would really appreciate any advice from those who’ve made a similar move or have insights into the process. My long-term goal is PE, but I’m looking to break into IB first (explained more in Q4).

Here are a few specific questions:

1. **Graduate vs. Experienced Hire:** Given my experience, would I be better off applying to graduate analyst programs (if I’m even eligible)? Or should I focus on experienced hire roles (Analyst or Associate)? If targeting EH roles, do banks even recruit for Y1 Analyst positions? How can I tell if a posting is for Y1/Y2/Y3 Analyst? I’m open to starting as a Y1 if it increases my chances, and conscious I’d be competing with IB laterals in the EH pool.
2. **Odds of Breaking into IB:** Realistically, how tough is it to make the switch from consulting to IB? I know it’s less common than the reverse — but is that also because fewer consultants pursue the move (e.g. because of WLB, having to restart)
3. **Odds of Breaking into PE:** Is PE significantly harder to break into than IB for someone with my background? Would appreciate any clarity here, as I’m assuming IB might be a more achievable near-term entry point.
4. **Recruiting for IB and PE Simultaneously:** Would you recommend applying to both IB and PE roles in parallel? There’s some overlap in prep (e.g., technicals), but I’ve heard mixed opinions - some suggest focusing on one path for credibility with recruiters. My rationale for trying both is to de-risk the process: if I don’t land a PE offer, I’d at least hope an IB role puts me one step closer rather than staying longer in consulting.
5. **Strategy for Breaking In:** For those who successfully made the switch - what actually worked? Headhunters, direct applications, referrals, networking?

Would really appreciate any advice, especially from those who’ve made the pivot or currently work in IB/PE and have seen consultants make the move. Thanks!",Radiant-Craft8058,1mdl73y,consulting,30-07-2025,22:55:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1mdl73y/consulting_ib_pe/

> # Using LLMs Instead of Government Consulting

> The U.S. government spends over $100 billion a year on consulting. As you might imagine, this isn't the most efficient or innovative part of our economy.

> But over the last couple of years, there have been a few big reasons we believe this will change. Most importantly, today, there is political pressure to cut wasteful consulting and spending. Every part of the government now runs on software, but usually custom software built by a consulting company, and anyone who has used this software knows we can do a lot better. Finally, LLMs today are so good that they can already do the jobs of many consulting firms.

> We've recently funded companies that help companies get approved to sell to the government, called FedRAMP. We've also recently funded companies that help the government cut regulation and use LLMs to help make sure the laws and policies coming out of the government are actually legal.

> We think there is a lot more work that government consulting firms like Deloitte and Accenture do for the government today, and we want to fund startups that build LLM software to do that work.

It’s not hard skills, what is consistent among feedbacks is that I keep leaving small errors in slides, and I feel like the manager is already influenced by the gossip about me. I don’t get distracted during the day and I am constantly organizing shit and building methods to do things in a orderly manner. Still seems like I am lacking something.

"as bad as we fellow consultants have it, it could always be worse","I woke up today and realized you could always have it worse.

I know many of you are not content with the way things are in consulting, but if you're in consulting you are by default a high achiever (or bullshitted your way into people believing you are one) and will constantly strive to push yourself further (higher pay, better firm, leave for a startup, leave for industry, ect) but we tend to love to compare ourselves to people in other industries (ib/vc/pe/hf/tech) that have it better or people who have ""made it""

but I woke up today after having a dream that I never got the offer and stayed where I was before joining consulting. There is a world where you never got the offer, you never got the acceptance. There's a world where everything didn't work in your favor and you ended up staying in academia, or ended up stuck doing a job you hate, or even ending up on the streets.

the pay in consulting isnt bad, its well above the average I'll tell you that. The learning opportunities and exit ops aren't bad if you networked well and took away a lot of great things during your time in consulting. The wlb can sometimes be complete doggy doo doo but even then there is typically a way to push through. (except for if you work at LEK, i'm sorry if you work at LEK this post does not apply to you, you are cooked, I am sorry for your loss and will be praying for you and even then im not sure god can save you)

Even though I personally believe we should always push to pursue more, sometimes its good to reflect back on what could have been and learn what we can to better ourselves for the future.

Feel like I’m getting bullied out,"

New graduate , working at a top recognized firm for a year now. On the surface, all my friends and family always holds me in high regard and assume I’m super successful to the point no one even asks how I’m doing. 

But reality is this past year has been horrible.. Getting treated like literal garbage by my manager, who has done nothing but put me down and make me feel horrible about myself.. And I’m not just talking about who I am professionally, but as a person in general, and my family - down to my core. He holds himself to such high regard and invalidates anything I’ve ever accomplished, or even any life experience (like literal hobbies and interests) that I’ve had is subpar and not as impressive as his. He constantly brags to me about how much money he has , and how his family comes from high class unlike mine, and how he is friends with all these “famous and important people” (which I suspect is brutally exaggerated), etc. All this to say I am literal trash, I am not good enough right now , and never will be. He essentially has told me I have no future at this company.

To add, this behaviour is very blatantly intentional and directed at me, he knows what he is doing - and has only been like this since I’ve been hired. When i got interviewed , he was the nicest guy. I even see him interacting with other people , and he can be such a nice guy. I feel like I’m just getting bullied to leave. I’ve never been even CLOSE to the type of person to get bullied, so this is all foreign to me especially since this is my manager at the end of the day and I just have to take all this shit. Exhibits all characteristics of a psychopath, to a tee.

Has anyone had an experience like this ? Should I run ? Or should I just suck it up and continue if this is fairly common.

On paper everything looks great, 1500$ monthly salary pay cut but bonus would be 100%, housing is provided (ca. 4.000$ rent is covered per month), educational support for when I have children up until high school, 9-5 working week. The client is also one of the most well-regarded companies globally in their sector.

The problem is they have a pretty strict tenure requirements for different levels at the company since it's partly state-owned. With my tenure i'm going to be starting basically at the bottom of the rank. Since it's a pretty political company, I think joining them at the bottom of the rank will only make my life harder. On top of that, going from almost EM/PL/M to bottom of the rank of a corporation doesn't seem like a good career move. I also put in so much work to get to where I am now and jumping ship just before an EM/PL/M promotion doesn't feel right. I feel like all in all I'm still in a position to push a bit more and who knows maybe it will unlock more doors and opportunities in the future. I also really want to push for C-Level at some point and I think the move to the client doesn't support it for various reason I won't go into.

I'll speak with the VP again this week to tell her that I'm very interested but I want to pursue the opportunity of being promoted since it's a big personal and professional milestone.

1099 uncompensated for meetings,"I work as a sub for a client for about 2 years. It’s a relatively small company and the owner is a bit domineering in his character. This client convenes quarterly meetings that all subs are expected to attend along with the small salaried staff. The subs are not paid for these meetings, and are expected to participate in ongoing discussions about how to increase revenue, grow the business, etc. 

Otherwise, nothing of practical value to the subs is ever shared in these meetings, and sometimes the owner openly vents his frustration about us not doing something (maybe intended for the salaried staff, but he never differentiates).

Inherited a ghost ship. A year later I’m solo-project managing a dumpster fire with no water.,"I wasn’t hired as a project manager, I didn’t even have training. But the universe - or maybe just my department - took one look at me and said, “You look like you can handle chaos” and handed me the reins to a long-dead project. So here I am.

The Starting Point:
About a year ago, I inherited a project that had been bouncing around for years. It was meant to improve internal processes and SaaS software configuration, but hadn’t moved into anything tangible - just scattered emails, vague expectations, and some deeply buried hopes.

There was no delivery history. No scope. No structure. No governance. No budget. No plan. No nothing, other than being resourced with… me.

I had zero formal project management experience. But I can write a killer OneNote, do some technical shit, and look calm while internally screaming - so I guess that qualified me?

What I Did (aka: turned water into wine):
- Reshaped the project into a phased delivery model just to get something live.
- Created a proper (albeit heavily constrained) project plan.
- Scoped core deliverables. Mapped dependencies.
- Re-engaged stakeholders. Documented future-state processes.
- Did the actual technical system work myself because, again, I am the team.

All while re-aligning outputs with shifting goalposts, dodging interference from other projects, and fending off the “oh, by the way, can we also…” moments like a rabid raccoon with a broom defending its (garbage) house from the garbage truck.

Where We Are Now (in theory):
I’ve spent months trying to secure additional resourcing to help avoid the inevitable. Alas, I’m still flying solo. And now, as I try to actually implement this first phase, I’m being asked for more governance structures - change management strategies, risk plans, UAT frameworks - all the beautifully formatted artefacts that definitely weren’t mentioned when I started bailing water out of the sinking ship with a spoon.

Look, I get it. Governance is important. But at this point in the project? 

It kinda feels like air traffic control radioing the pilot mid-Mayday and telling them to circle back and write a new flight plan before they’re allowed to land.

Meanwhile, expectations are still based on me “just getting it done” - while I'm juggling live delivery, zero resourcing, delayed timelines, and a brain that feels like a room covered in sticky notes, panic fog, and the distant sound of nails scraping a whiteboard.

What I’m Wondering:
- Is this just what project management is… actually like?
- Have others fallen into accidental PM roles like this?
- What would you have done differently (or not done at all)?
- Should I lean into project management pathways, or just write “traumatised but made it work” on my gravestone and move on?
- And honestly — how do you all stay sane?

Would love to hear thoughts, war stories, advice, or just validation that I'm probably not hallucinating this whole experience.

Industry exit guidance needed,"Hey everyone, 

Need some guidance on career paths from veterans and experienced professionals.

I’m currently an offshore consultant in india. while I did receive a salary hike just about a month ago, I’ve recently been offered an internal strategy role in the industry.

The new role is interesting and aligns well with what I want to do. The location works for me too. However, the total compensation offered is only slightly higher than my pre-hike salary — so in a way, it’s like a lateral move financially.

Should I wait in big4 see if I get promoted or take the offer and search parallel for better roles ?

Would love to hear from others who’ve made similar transitions or have thoughts on how to weigh this decision. Is it worth holding out for the promotion? Or should I take the industry leap and build from there?

Thanks in advance!

Reasons : not promoted , work is monotonous and non value adding 

Other fields interested in : product marketing,  growth marketing 

Will it be viewed as a downgrade if i move from consulting to product marketing by recruiters later ? Apart from opportunities being narrowed

Emotionally burned out by ERP Consulting,"Sorry for the rant. I have the luck to have a normal workload unlike other people in this field and this is my first job ever after college.

Junior SAP FICO Consultant on the first public cloud project of the firm which is a takeover on an already live system (which was designed for two former company codes, and reveal problem with the go live of a new one almost everyweek that we can't understand the source of it). I feel like every day I struggle on absurd shit that I can't solve, from which I don't have any proper documentation and no one in the firm used such system before.

Every tuesday I get fucking punched by the client remarks because no, I'm sorry I let your ticket rotten because your live system fucking sucks and I feel like I don't have a fucking idea of what I'm doing.

My senior on the project is the CEO of the firm because we are lacking FICO seniors at the moment. The communication is very sporadic and I always feel pressured to talk to him because he has more important shit to do like running the damn firm. So I spend days, or week before being able to had a proper meeting to discuss the project.

I started crying at desk this week because I feel like I can't take this shit anymore. I just miss college, solving mathematical and statistical issues that made sense, studying finance topics like banking portfolio management and econometrics (now I only do accounting which I fucking hate), having some sens of accomplishment of succeeding exams after exams and not painfully answering a non sense ticket after days and asking your senior because you didn't knew some absurd rule of a table.

Thinking of Switching from Utility Consulting to Power Utility,"Anyone made this switch? 

Currently 7 YOE in utility consulting, manager for 3 years. Path to director is there, but not sure I want to try to balance family growing + husband's job + my consulting job. Integrated capital planning for power utilities and regulatory business case development, want to stay close to this line of work (ideally). My boss is pushing pushing pushing for me to get to the next level, take on more sales, becoming regulatory expert witness, etc., and our team is so small it feels like I can't ask for a slow down. 

Slowly thinking at this point in life, it's time to switch to working for a utility. I have a toddler, with baby due in December. We want one more, and I'd love to adopt on top of that. My husband's potential next job is going to require a lot more travel, and I just don't want to have to get an Aupair to make his + my careers work. 

Who has made this transition and how did it go? I've always said I'll work for a utility when I'm ready to retire... they move so slow. Did it drive you crazy? Did you have wayyyy better work/life balance? I'm not worried about comp decreasing, that's a given. I know I can't be a stay at home mom, I'd try to run my house like a work project. Kids live's don't need to be dictated by spreadsheets and process efficiency SOPs :)

I think I'm afraid I'll be stuck at an unfulfilling, snail-pace moving, great idea and process improvement not-caring role, and I won't be happy. I'm scared to slow down, but also definitely need to if I want to be present for my kids.

Got a surprisingly bad review from my manager despite regular feedback...,"I recently joined a tech consulting firm as a Senior Consultant and was staffed on a competitive strategy project. Things were going fairly well until I was asked to build a model that was outside the scope of what I’d done in previous roles.

I completed the model and walked my manager through my thought process. Over the next couple of weeks, he made several edits to it. Then one morning, he called me out of the blue and said, “I just wanted to apologize if I offended you — did you see my message on Teams?” I hadn’t, and the whole thing felt strange. He then added, “Just to be transparent, the model wasn’t at a level I found acceptable.” Essentially a made a negative comment in our group chat that was supposed to be sent to one of two other people regarding my model. 

We had recurring biweekly feedback check-ins, which I personally scheduled to ensure transparency and improve continuously. During those sessions, I’d ask for direct feedback, but he was always vague and never pointed to any major concerns. I assumed things were okay and the model was a one time slip up 

However, when the project ended, I received an unexpectedly very negative review. When I spoke with my counselor, they told me the review was unusually bad and that my manager had shown them exactly where I went wrong within the model — things he never shared directly with me. The counselor was surprised and mentioned that this kind of situation is rare.

I can’t help but feel blindsided. I made an effort to ask for feedback regularly, and if there were issues with the model, why weren’t they shared directly during our check-ins? It feels like he withheld feedback only to document it later and tank my review.

Has anyone else experienced something like this? Why would a manager avoid direct feedback in real time but bring it up during formal reviews instead?


TL;DR:
I regularly asked for feedback from my manager during a strategy project, but he gave vague responses and never flagged major issues. After the project, I got a surprisingly bad review — apparently due to a model I built — but the detailed critique was only shared with others, not with me. Feeling blindsided and wondering why this would happen?

Most women in consulting are gone by their 30s. Why?,"Watching another brilliant working mom quietly exit the partner track this month. She was crushing it until she had kids, then suddenly every promotion conversation became about ""work-life balance"" and ""maybe try a local office role.""

Same pattern every time: travel becomes impossible, male peers advance while she's managing an ""impossible"" juggling act, zero role models who've actually figured this out.

The frustrating part? She didn't want to leave. Loved the work, great at it, strong network. But the system pushed her out right when she should be hitting her stride.

I’ve been in consulting for nearly a year, and it’s been intense from the start. At one point I was working over 90 hours a week for months, with frequent travel. The team dynamic was tough, and I constantly felt like I was falling short. I learned a lot, but at a heavy cost.

I’ve been thinking about pursuing something more mission-driven, but that would mean staying longer. I also received an offer outside of consulting, and I keep wondering whether I’m truly interested or just looking for a way out.

They keep putting industry experience above real consulting skills and don’t really get the differences between strategy, management, or tech consulting etc. So, in case interviews, candidates are mostly lost with no structure or classic problem-solving skills.

HR has never done consulting, and leadership kinda doesn't know what to look for as well. We end up with people who struggle a ton and the team has to absorb the impact. Much of our workforce is like that now.

Is this just us? Do other boutique firms (or larger firms) deal with the same thing?

Dealing With A Toxic / Abusive Client,"Sorry for a bit of a rant, but I had a rather bizarre meeting last week, and I am not sure if I handled it appropriately. I've had a discussion with my mentor about this, but I would love to hear what the collective mind thinks about the situation...

Some backstory, the client is a rather grumpy older man who can be prone to randomly aggressive comments directed at anyone in the room. I've seen him tear into his own VP - who happens to be his son - so anyone is seemingly fair game for his anger.

His company represents a major part of our small firm's annual revenue, so we generally work with others in his team rather than directly with the CEO. We have other consultants in our firm who just simply will not work with him.

On to the current situation, I scheduled a meeting between myself and one of his company's vendors to discuss some supply chain enhancements we were targeting. As a courtesy, I invited the CEO....

This meeting was going to result in a potential $50M revenue gain for our client, so it was something that I assumed would be non-confrontational in any way.

Just before the meeting started is where it all started to go badly.... I saw him log in along with some of the vendors... and then my phone rings. It is the CEO yelling at me because I chose MS Teams as the meeting platform (our standard, and one he has used before) and that his microphone would not work and that it was impossible to make any sense of the conversation - essentially blaming me for his own equipment not working.

I offer to help him troubleshoot his laptop.. to which he blurted out ""What... do you think I am a fucking idiot? Of course I tried that!""

So I just put him on speaker and sat my phone down next to my laptop so the others could hear him when he wanted to speak.

As the meeting goes on, the others can't hear him well through this makeshift solution, so I try to translate what he said to those on the call. 

This went as poorly as you would expect.

He started yelling at me that I was not saying what he said, or that my summaries were not correct or.. or.. or.. 

We then got to a point in the meeting where we were discussing the primary action item behind the improvement and he chimes in ""No \[addressing me by name\] That won't work! This is flawed from the start... "" Note: this is the polite version, he was a LOT more explicit... but he was laying this on me exclusively.

We all just stopped. Everyone on the call had been in the previous meeting where he had suggested the whole idea in the first place. We were just implementing HIS idea... 

No one wanted to speak, so I gently said, ""ummmm.... this was your idea. The structure of it came from \[meeting notes I captured a few weeks earlier\]... we are just doing what you suggested. If there is something flawed in this, let's try to figure out why you thought it was a good idea in the first place""

He then went on a rant that ended up circling back - with no admission that he forgot it was his idea - that this would work after all.

I will be honest, at this point my emotions were getting to me...  I wanted to cry... frustration yes, but mostly just out of anger! 

We wrap up the call because we are out of time and I was more than happy to make it end.

Since then, I have been very concerned that I handled myself correctly. I don't think he did this because I am a younger female. I think he is just a grumpy, toxic person who thrives beating others down for some reason. I tried to be accomodating. I tried to be polite. I tried to be professional.

We had never really had any negative interactions before, and since this meeting we have been in other meetings where he was absolutely fine with me. I don't expect this to happen again, but I also want to be prepared if it does.

My question is this... how would you have handled this knowing that this is known behavior, knowing that this was PROBABLY not personal, knowing that he is a high value client, knowing that he has gone off on anyone and everyone, etc...

Is Responsiveness becoming a lost art?,"This has been bugging me lately. A couple of months ago, a marketing consultant reached out with a solid pitch to promote our business.

Smart guy. Clear plan. Asked good questions. My business partner and I liked him a lot.

We followed up with a few basic questions about scope and some contract terms, standard stuff.

Then… nothing, not even a “Need a couple of days to get back to you.”

We nudged him. Three days later, he replied: “Sorry, I was tied up.”  
Okay, I understand, life happens. A week later, nothing. 

So we sent a thank-you and said we were going a different direction. No reply!

And it didn’t stop there.

Freelancer for email consulting? Same story.  
Affiliate marketing expert? Ghosted.

Five similar experiences in two months.

Ten years ago, I would’ve been seriously annoyed. Maybe even blasted them online :).

But now I find it fascinating. And honestly, I feel a little bad for these consultants/business owners. Are they serious about getting clients and growing their business? Because they’re not losing deals due to a lack of talent, it’s a lack of responsiveness (probably the most basic/underrated skill for a new business).

Am I just old school? Is this a generational thing? Are people no longer as hungry for business?

To fellow entrepreneurs, especially new ones, I’ll say this,

Responsiveness:

1. Builds trust before money changes hands
2. Is not about personality, it’s a habit you train and a muscle you build
3. Can help you stand out and win more deals

I get it. Life gets busy. We’ve all got a lot going on. But if a prospect has to chase you? It’s already too late.

What’s been your experience with vendors and consultants lately? Is responsiveness becoming a lost art? Or are expectations just shifting?",startupwithferas,1m45ek1,consulting,19-07-2025,19:55:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1m45ek1/is_responsiveness_becoming_a_lost_art/

Operating Model Design,"Hi team,

In this profession, i find that the word operating model is used highly frequently but with nuances to the definition and intent. Ive never actually however been part of an operating model design piece, but am due to be staffed on one shortly.

How do you define operating model? When you do an operating model design for an organisation what are the high level steps you design your workplan around?

From my own firm i find it exceptionally vague, and our IP is not great on it. hoping you can firm up.

The way i am thinking is it starts with whats our strategy, so what capabilities do we need to have, where do those capabilities sit (internal vs external), where are our gaps today (e.g. map in FTE, spend to these capability areas) what are they key processes we need to execute and the accountabilities within that process.

Struggling to please Manager,"I’m a Senior Consultant at a tech consulting firm, currently staffed on a communications-focused project — and I’m having a really hard time figuring out how to succeed under my manager.

I took over this project from another Senior Consultant who had been on it for 6–7 months, and I joined in early June — so naturally, there’s a lot of background to catch up on.

The strange part is that I don’t find the work itself challenging. What’s hard is getting the deliverables to match my manager’s expectations. He recently said he’s concerned about the velocity of my work — even though I’ve been turning in everything on time.

The biggest issue is around communication (ironically). He often says I don’t include enough context in my emails. But when I do add context, he cuts it down and says it’s too long. When I try to make it short and to the point, he adds context back in — the kind of stuff I wouldn’t have known to include unless I could read his mind. It’s been super frustrating because no matter which way I go, I seem to be off.

Today he told me my deliverables still aren’t where they need to be. I’ve been proactive, responsive, and timely, but I’m clearly not hitting the standard he wants. For example earlier in the project, he told me I could ask a lot of questions — but when I asked a clarifying question today about one of his comments about changing the format of something. I simply wanted to clarify and visualize what he meant quickly as he made the comment last night (30 secs tops)  and he basically implied it was a dumb question. So now I don’t even know when it’s “okay” to ask and don't feel comfortable asking even though the program is still a bit confusing. 

The kicker? I’m stuck on this project through December (unless I get rolled off). It’s not challenging me intellectually and my manager isn’t happy with my performance. 

The only upside is that he does give consistent feedback — unlike some managers who say you’re doing fine and then surprise you with a bad formal review. 

Any advice?

* How would you frame risks around first-mover advantage, regulatory uncertainty, or infrastructure gaps?

"Acquired, demoted, and burnt out","In a tough situation and looking for advice. My company was recently acquired by a major strategy consulting firm.

How do you coordinate PTO with teams that include people from other companies?,"
I’m a technical consultant involved in projects for multiple clients. Each project often includes several third-party collaborators. A recurring challenge we face is coordinating holidays and there is always a spread sheet involved.
We typically share our time off internally within our company, but externals have no access of course. More often than not I need to share my PTO on multiple teams spreadsheets.

Is there an existing service that facilitates this kind of shared holiday visibility across mixed teams? And if not, would it be worth building a shared calendar tool where each team member can add their planned holidays, making them visible to everyone involved in the project?

I imagine the UX to be something similar to Miro, but focus on a calendar instead of post its. And you only share a calendar once and this is visible on all projects where you are a member.

"""Chief of Staff"" is a terrible name for the job","The title has my whole point. 

I think this new found use of the title - chief of staff - is silly, nonspecific probably egoistic. I worked in VC backed tech a decade ago, it started to become a thing then. They were calling, what were essentially their, personal advisors and EAs this thing. The terms original military use has little resemblance to its current use in the corporate world. 

It was meant to provide commanding officers a secretarial leader of their personal staff - different than the actual unit commanders under their command. The term staff is important because the various functions of the officers staff scaled down from the brigade to the battalion (operations, supply, intelligence, manpower etc.). There is no version of this in the corporate world. There isn't a downstream of chief of staff with a replicating set of supporting functions (finance, HR, strategy etc.)

Politics has a way better adoption of this concept than the corporate world. Chief of staff in politics function to provide political staff secretarial leadership. These political staff are different than permanently employed civil servants. They are there to propel the political agenda of the politician/minister/secretary. This is expressly different than the function of civil servants. 

If I have to take a guess on why this term has become widely adopted, it's because older millennials watched far too much west wing and house of cards. Everyone wants to be Josh and Remi in their start up or strategy group in some big co. 

Chief of staff need a better name. Advisor to the XYZ / principal secretary to the XYZ / executive affairs director...anything else would be more specific and helpful.

Compensation advice,"
I’m approaching my 2.5-year mark at a consulting firm and will be eligible for my first promotion and compensation review in early 2026. Currently, I’m earning around $70K (pre-tax).

I work in a specialized implementation area that plays a foundational role in our projects. From what I can tell, there are only a few of us in the firm with this specific certification, and it’s fairly critical to successful delivery. Given the niche nature of the role and the upcoming promotion, I want to approach the negotiation as informed as possible.

For those who’ve been promoted from analyst/associate/junior consultant to the next level — especially in specialized or high-leverage roles — what kind of salary bump did you see? Any tips for making the case for a more substantial increase?

Stuttering,"Hi all, I’ve been dealing with something this year that I need to get off my chest. I grew up with a speech impediment (stutter). It went away as I got older but in my current job its come back and its pretty bad. I have to speak with a lot of clients and its really frustrating when there’s things I want to say but the words just wont come out. Oddly enough, I dont stutter at all around my friends/family - Ive noticed it comes out only during professional settings, coffee chats, and interviews. Aka where it matters the most. Its making my life pretty miserable and I go into work every day feeling depressed. My confidence is at an all time low and it sucks because I know im capable (I have my CFA and graduated from a tier 1 school). I used to be able to interview confidentally at places like MBB but now I can’t even talk normally to my colleagues. Im at the point where I want to quit my job, but idk what to do. Idk how I can overcome this. 

Edit:
Ive been reading every one of your responses, and I just want to say thank you. This is something thats been really vulnerable for me to share. It feels good to take it off my chest and know that im not alone.

[UK] Looking to leave consultancy,"Kind of a rant, kind of a cry for help, kind of an insight into my role

Currently working at a mid to large renewables tech advisory consultancy at early / mid grade. Been here around 6 years having joined on a graduate scheme out of university. 

Some parts of my industry have taken a bit of a nosedive with the world geopolitical situation, my specific technology is doing ok but colleagues in others are struggling. Overall department not doing great so far this year, off the back of a few bumper years previously. 

Honestly just fed up of consultancy:
- the pressure to meet charge-ability targets, 
- the pressure from management to sell work making it feel like we are flogging double glazing, 
- the feeling that we contribute nothing meaningful as work is so heavily caveated and disclaimered, 
- the feeling of doing work not that you’re proud of, but which is at the minimum acceptable level to send to clients. 
- progression that looks like longer hours, more sales pressure, more management admin and less technical focus. 

I did pretty good in uni and felt lucky and like I worked hard to land this job (which I was / did don’t get me wrong) but now after 6 years I feel like I massively wasted my time. I want to leave consulting behind I think it’s a toxic industry frankly. Would love to go into a technical specialist kind of role at a developer but they don’t seem to exist, or it’s one guy who did it for past 10 years (I know as those guys are my customers). 

Struggling to think what roles I’d enjoy, which would be more fulfilling but still pay me roughly the same. At least now I have 6 years tenure.. 

Working on updating CV as we speak but would love to hear from anyone else who left consultancy behind and what they ended up doing. 

Cheers for listening / reading.

 * [For everyone else, read wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/nontargetrecruiting)
 * The most common entry points into major consulting firms (especially MBB) are through target program undergrad and MBA recruiting.  Entering one of these channels will provide the greatest chance of success for the large majority of career switchers and consultants planning to 'upgrade'.  
 * Experienced hires do happen, but is a much smaller entry channel and often requires a combination of strong pedigree, in-demand experience, and a meaningful referral.  Without this combination, it can be very hard to stand out from the large volume of general applicants.

How do I deal with a senior colleague who sets unrealistic expectations and keeps putting the blame on me?,"I am a junior in consulting, and I’ve been working with senior colleague (not my direct manager) who plays a big role on the project. While they have supported me in some ways and I do respect their work ethic, working with them is REALLY difficult.

I am not sure how to approach this - I have expressed my concern to them multiple times, but this time it's been too much. They got mad at me for deciding to leave at the end of the day to continue from home.

Below is what i have been dealing with, i would appreciate your advice on this:

* They gives me clear unrealistic deadlines with no technical support at all (they're usually on their phone). When I try to manage everything, they still expects things to be done perfectly and quickly, and if I don’t meet the deadline, the blame always comes to me.
   * Once they gave me the wrong contact number to someone. I was the one to be blamed because I invited the wrong person. I literally was trying to help?
* Even when I tell them the deadline is unrealistic, they either:
   * express how ""uncertain"" they were on how I was managing my time effectively
   * or undermine my estimation (i.e., I say a task would take 2 hours, they thinks its too much and 40 minutes is enough thus i will never meet their ""expectations"")
* I’ve shared with them before that I was under pressure (both personal and work-related), and since then they keeps repeating that I’m “not focused” instead of actually working with me to figure things out.
   * they even used the fact that I wasn’t sleeping well to justify that I’m not focused at work.
* When I try to explain what I’m dealing with, they always brings it back to “discipline” or says I’m not meeting expectations, never acknowledging that the environment or workload could be part of the issue.
* in one of the meetings after I prepared everything they asked for, they challenged me about who’s responsible for what from the client side, when I hadn’t even been introduced to those people. I had no way of knowing.
* I’ve already talked to them once, but nothing changed. Now they scheduled another meeting for tomorrow. I’m thinking of sending them / partner a message beforehand to explain how I really feel, calmly and professionally, and also possibly raising this with a partner if things don’t improve.

Manager: when to leave?,"Hi everyone,

I am a Manager (4 years in) in corporate finance and strategy consulting in a Big 4 and I am facing the following dilemma:

1. On the one side, I quite like the work, the Manager position, the team, the company even. I am generally happy with it and don’t have much to complain

2. On the other side, I increasingly think I am not partner material. I don’t like (or am particular good) at selling, and I see the partner’s life as worse than mine in every relevant aspect I can think of (except money). More sales oriented, same or less personal life, more pressure.

Therefore, while I am happy with my current situation, I am afraid that if I stay too much longer (into senior manager and director territory) my marketability to other positions may decrease. I certainly wouldn’t like to become a trapped senior manager/director, as I have seen happen a few times.

Thus: when should I leave? Stay because I like the job until I don’t or preemptively start looking for exits to avoid dragging myself into roles I dislike?

How to transfer files from business computer to personal computer without being traced,"Hi, 

I recently started a new job in a large company. I often need to rewrite or edit Word documents and PDFs, and I'd like to use a local AI I've set up on my personal computer (offline, no privacy issue), which also has my own Adobe Acrobat Pro installed. However, the company's IT has extremely strict security policies in place. The work laptop is locked down with FortiClient, and they’ve blocked: all online AI, Gmail, Google Drive, Box/Dropbox, Outlook and Yahoo mail, remote desktop access. They also hide the local hard drive so I can't install software. Basically, the laptop is like an isolated island, only allowed to access whitelisted websites. I tried logging into my work OneDrive on my personal computer to download documents but then I was not able to do it after two days. I think that they are monitoring network activity and flagged it.

I want a way to transfer files ( .docx and .pdf) from my work laptop to my personal PC to make use of my local AI and Adobe. I don't know if Microsoft To-Do or Google Keep will work in this case, or using the email draft. Has anyone dealt with something similar? Is there any creative but non-risky solution for this kind of file transfer?

I’m torn. Part of me wants to stop all new work until we have a signed contract and a deposit. Another part worries that billing retroactively might sour the relationship. Equity instead of cash feels risky.

Is it worth getting a sponsored MBA?,"Sorry if this question has been asked before.

I'm in a position to get a sponsored MBA after 2 years at my firm (MBB). They'll also sponsor other degrees that are business-adjacent. I have the grades and GRE to (hopefully) get into an M5 or LBS/Insead for 2026 start. I already have an MSc in genetics.

I'm wondering whether the MBA has been worth it for those in a similar situation who have done it. Does it/the network provide meaningful career progression? Do people even care in today's day and age? Is it worth the 2 years of no/limited income vs. progressing in your career? I'm hearing mixed reviews from those in my network, but many of them came to consulting after the MBA. If I do this, I would have to go back to my firm for 2 years.

Long-term, I'm not totally sure where I want to end up but something at the intersection of investment and science sounds like a good fit and interesting.

Any tips for managing ad hoc subcontractors without losing control of spend?,"I’m a solo consultant working with a few clients across different industries, and lately I’ve started bringing in subcontractors for parts of the work, think freelance designers, writers and analysts on short term or project based tasks.

The work’s solid, but the challenge has been managing their spending without having to micromanage or manually approve every little expense. I want to give them flexibility to move fast, but I also don’t want to wake up to surprise charges that blow the budget. Right now, I’ve started assigning each subcontractor a separate virtual card with a fixed cap per week or per project. I use Adro for my business banking, and I issue multiple cards under one account which helps a ton. Each card is labeled by name or role and I can freeze or adjust limits instantly if something goes sideways.

It’s been working pretty well so far, but I’m curious how others are handling this especially if you work with multiple short term collaborators. Do you give them full access? Prepay for tools?

Ethically, it seems clear that this information should stay within the client's walls and not be shared internally beyond what's necessary for delivery.

WTF KPMG?,"I’m genuinely curious what is going on at KPMG. A couple of years ago my company hired KPMG as services delivery partners. Our standard onboarding process for a new hire is about 12 weeks. We took KPMGs team and hand-held them for 6 months and they were still not fully onboarded. We are talking hours of one-on-one training and coaching that they would request and then still say they didn’t feel ready. The most they delivered to us was a single updated slide deck. One of the project managers was at a high-school level for presentation skills. We eventually fired them and went back all in-house delivery and have spent significantly less money.

Now a similar thing is happening at my husband’s company. They hired KPMG to assist with software development and it has literally more than tripled the amount of time it takes for them to get code out the door. My husband spent the entire weekend redoing the work of a KPMG developer because they clearly didn’t read the JIRA tickets and released super buggy code that was against the design standards laid out for them. They insist on 2 hours of scrum meetings every day and don’t even include the people doing the coding. His company is now *also* looking at firing KPMG.

 Wtf is wrong with KPMG? Why are they so consistently bad across industries? And why do businesses continue to sink costs into these useless services?

UK Freelance programmer - Advice wanted re rates.,"After some advice.

I do some work for somebody who is absolutely convinced that my rate is enough, if not ""too much"".

For this person i do full stack web development (PHP, C#, JS, CSS, HTML etc etc etc).

I'm in the UK and the average wage in a full time job for this type of work would be £50k a year (+ - depending on where you are).

I do this on a freelance basis, and charge £25 an hour. I feel given the economic climate and so on, while this was fine 11 years ago when I started doing work for this person, now it is not even close to enough.

I've been doing the web dev stuff since 2009, so 15 years of commercial experience at this point (Been programming since was young but doesn't count for work).

My question is - is £25 an hour reasonable on a freelance basis? What do other people in the same situation charge? Am I being ridiculous and expecting too much, or are they? I've been told you should DOUBLE what you would get in employment, so i should be charging more like £50 an hour - is this right?

In the past i have bought up the subject and been told its ""too much"" already??? It just doesn't seem right to me.

Should I quit my job? Am I crazy?,"Hi everyone — I graduated college about a year ago and joined a life science consulting firm six months ago. I'm currently in a rotational program where we cycle through three different business units. I’m still in my first rotation, but I’ve come to realize that I just don’t have any real interest in the pharmaceutical space.

So far, my work has been focused on the same drug and the same company, just across different disease areas. At first, it was manageable, mostly because I had the support of a really great, tight-knit team. But as I’ve started working with new people outside of that original group, I’ve realized a harsh truth: a lot of folks at this company — especially in middle management — are difficult to work with, to put it lightly.
On one project, my manager would regularly cold call me at 10 or 11 p.m. to ask for deliverables due the same night (granted, it was a busy week with a report, but still). On my most recent project, things got worse — this manager has gone out of his way to undermine me, criticize me constantly, and even talk badly about me in staffing calls with other managers.

I know I’m still learning and have plenty of areas to improve, and I’ve been working hard — regularly putting in 60–70 hour weeks to pull my weight. But every time I fix one thing, he finds something else to tear down. I’ve tried to break this cycle by asking detailed questions upfront so I can deliver exactly what’s expected, but half the time he can’t give a straight answer — usually because he doesn’t know what he actually wants. He also plays games, like calling to say, “I know the answer but I want to see if you do,” and then using my response to suggest I don’t understand the project. This kind of behavior has become the norm with him.
Now, it feels like my name is associated with failure, at least within this small circle. I’ve heard from others that this manager is difficult to work with, so I’m hoping that people I’ve worked with outside of this team can vouch for me (mostly people outside of this group have said positive things about me). But truthfully, the negativity, combined with the long hours and lack of real passion for the space, has completely burned me out. I’ve lost most of my motivation, and I’ve started applying for jobs elsewhere. At this point, I’ve stopped taking the feedback from this manager to heart because it no longer feels constructive.

I guess I’m just wondering — am I being a brat for wanting to leave? Or is this just the reality check that this role and company may not be the right fit for me? Should I stay and hope my next team in my next rotation may be better?",Odd_Significance_402,1lw27tc,consulting,10-07-2025,03:07:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1lw27tc/should_i_quit_my_job_am_i_crazy/

Need help to choose a career path,"Hi everyone, hope you're all doing well.

I'm currently a Senior 2 at a Big 4 firm, working in a division that focuses on Healthcare and Life Sciences through a technology lens (basically, tech consulting for healthcare stakeholders). For context, I’m really aiming to move into the pharma industry—I’ve got a strong interest in the field, backed by a one-year internship in a Big Pharma company within their Business Development team (which is basically the equivalent of Corporate Development). I’m especially passionate about the digitalization of R&D processes and want to build real expertise in that area.

Right now, my firm mostly does projects for public healthcare institutions, which is starting to frustrate me. They’ve been saying for a while that they want to develop the private healthcare/pharma side, but so far it hasn’t materialized. I’ve asked multiple times to be staffed on pharma-related projects, but the reality is: we just don’t have the brand recognition to win those clients yet. That said, since the pharma sector is still an untapped market for us, it could be a great opportunity for me to take the lead on developing it. I’ve got a few contacts in the industry, I understand some of the current tech needs in pharma, and my leadership seems to have long-term plans for me—they’d support me if I wanted to take initiative here.

On the flip side, I’m in talks with another Big 4 firm that has its own Healthcare & Life Sciences practice. I already spoke with the partner (who came from a smaller firm he founded), and he’s kind of taking an intrapreneurial approach to grow the life sciences vertical. They already have some pharma clients, but the current engagements are mostly CRM deployments. The practice is still early-stage—not very structured yet, not many consultants onboard, and it’s mostly focused on the tail end of the pharma value chain, while I’m more interested in the early stages, particularly R&D.

My long-term goal is to fast-track my consulting career to partner as quickly as possible.

So, what would you recommend? Stay where I am and try to build the pharma offering from scratch (with some support), or take the leap to the other firm with existing pharma clients, even if it's not the ideal scope for me yet?",G0DSK3L3T0N,1lvuiyp,consulting,09-07-2025,21:13:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1lvuiyp/need_help_to_choose_a_career_path/

Counsellor seems to prey on my downfall and seems obsessive with me? (Big 4 consulting),"I don’t know if this is normal but my counsellor is constantly micro managing me, seems unhappy when I tell them I’ve found a project, is constantly asking me where I am in the office and a number of other behaviors that feel obsessive. 

Is this normal behavior? I had a counsellor before this who was very relaxed and I guess I seldom saw them so they were on the complete opposite end of the spectrum. Our regular check in meetings (monthly or even longer stretches) was just them saying keep up the good work. Unfortunately this counsellor has since left and I have this new one. 

This new counsellor instead seems quite disappointed and skeptical even when I tell them I am on a project - and will proceed to ask a bunch of details like who is the partner and service line and client etc, asking me to forward all emails and details onto them. Asking me a bunch of information and telling me they will tell the partner to keep me off the project because they would rather me do a more technical piece even though I don’t have a technical background? I remember one time when I was weirded out and I guess they could read it, they clarified it wasn’t because they were trying to investigate me but needed to know for record keeping purposes…and gave the creepiest smile ever. They make me fill out lengthy documents about my future goals before our check ins (which the previous counsellor never did) and although that might sound helpful, it’s really not, it’s a bunch of time wasted on very common sense stuff you would do in high school. They are also asking me to constantly schedule check ins with them. In the past three weeks I have had three weekly check in calls with them. They are also always asking me to come into the office. It’s quite…strange and overbearing and I feel kinda creeped out by them and I don’t know how to describe it. 

I also don’t feel they advocate for me in general and I don’t know why but I have a sneaking suspicion they are actually circulating and amplifying the minimal negative feedback there is about me? I can’t remember what gave me this impression but I think it was an off handed comment they made to a partner in one of our performance reviews.

How to go from a strategy to implementation?,"I have recently developed a personal strategy using a framework called the B12 framework (as seen in picutre below). As you can see in the framework, it contains three main components, strategy, operating model and a business model, each further segregated into four subcategories. 

Once I completed building all these components, I went to the question of implementation. I started wondering what is the best way to translate this strategy into an implementation plan. However, I am not quite sure how to go about that. 

here are the main options I am considering: 

1. Starting from the initiatives and building KPIs and a workplan for delivery. In addition, I am also plannig to include the current projects I am working on. 

2. Start from my projects' workplans and keep working. I am afraid that with this method, I'd be losing my focus from the strategic element and will get bogged down in delivering engagements without much focus on where I need to be in the longer term. 

Rationale for posting here: I have recently moved to consulting with nonprofit and social sector, so everything above should be considered within that context.

Dealing with a client claiming issues that don't exist,"Long story short, I have a client I built a small app for. They have used it for 7 or so years. The previous person left that managed it. Now someone else does. Besides the fact this client calls and emails everyday the big issue is they claim there is a non-existent problem. And I have no idea what to do. I've told them I've found no issues and something is wrong on their end. But from everything I know about tech, I doubt there is a spam filter causing the problem. My best guess, is they are doing this on purpose. Why I don't know. 

Longer version.

There is a report that is emailed to them every night. They claim it's incorrect. They forwarded me the report and it's clearly incorrect.

I run the code manually to check the report, that report is correct. I tell them this and I email them the manually run report.

Well this has gone on now for over a week. Everyday, they say the report is incorrect and forward me a file that is incorrect. Mean while the other reports that run along side that report are correct and have no issues.

I BCC'd myself on the report to confirm it's working. Sure enough it was. Meaning the file was correct the entire time. Yet they would forward me the same email I was on but with a different file.

Then I added a checksum hash when the file is created on the server. For the non-tech people, it's a fingerprint of the file. To prove it's the same file. The checksum is created when the file is created and then also it's hidden in the email so I can validate the file never changed. Sure enough, I check the file, it's the same every single time. Yet the file they send me is incorrect.

Like not even closely the same file.

I don't know what to do here.

Clearly they are just wasting my time.

I've agreed to support them for the year but there is no signed agreement/contract. There is X amount of hours allocated for issues I didn't create but the issue is, I think they are going to claim this issue isn't from them. But it's not an issue and I can't bill against the agreed upon hours.

I'm more than willing to refund them partially as I've done code updates. If I didn't have to deal with this person, I wouldn't mind staying on. I really struggle with someone intentionally wasting my time. Even if it's a couple minutes a day.

Or do I just deal with them and accept that they suck as a client. I mean, it's known that my app will be replaced after this year.

Prospective employer changed staff role to a contractor role -- what do I need to ask?,"Hi all, I'm new here. I am in the middle of an interview process for a job I was very excited about.

What do you do for firm-side client / project documentation?,"Recently joined a new project that has other consultants on it who have rolled-off / rolled-on in the past, and I'll be starting on part-time for this gig. We didn't have much in the way of central resources / tracking when I started getting moving, how do y'all typically handle that? 

I'm usually FT embedded on client teams so it's my first time really needing to keep the project / delivery statuses organized for other folks who have some time allotted to this engagement. Curious what others use for low-lift on this, or if you just prefer to keep personal notes? 

SharePoint + Word Doc or just keeping a loose PPTX with some floating key info? Do you just keep it personal and share information as others need it? In the title but this would just be for the firm-side notes, not assets shared back to the client.

All of this is really discouraging..,"At work scrolling through this sub and frankly, I feel a bit depressed?

Context: 30 year old in Pakistan, just got my first strategy consulting role, was in sales and not really academically inclined during my undergrad (did mostly odd jobs and uber driving). Current firm is probably the only home grown consulting firm operating out of Pakistan. Clients are big business groups based out of KSA and wider GCC. 

I worked really hard to get into this profession, completed an MBA at the best B-school in Pakistan and have a bachelors from Australia. Reading through some of the posts made me realize how rigorous the profession is and how unhappy most of the people in top-tier orgs are. Made me think about my current role and how what i have been building up in my head is probably a life some of you on this sub have lived and now want to leave behind. 

I dont mind 50+ hour work weeks, grunt work or the lifestyle; however the biggest thorn in my side rn is how im doing pretty much everything consulting analysts do globally and am massively underpaid - making less than $900 a month. 

Im here looking to connect with people whom i can maybe connect with over zoom or any platform really to explore opportunites outside my country or even remotely - as long im being paid decently - and if theres not any opportunities then i would love to chat and learn from experienced professionals regardless.

Norm on mentioning names when working with client + PE firm,"
I’m updating my resume and working on two project descriptions. In both cases, we worked with a company and a leading PE firm. While I prefer not to name the client companies, I’m considering mentioning the PE firm since both deals were public:
	1.	In the first project, we supported a company through its pre-IPO readiness and filing process. The IPO was successful, and the PE firm was the lead investor
	2.	In the second project, we worked in growth strategy and then years later the PE firm divested a portion of its stake in the client company, which is also a public record",chakshu1997,1ltep71,consulting,06-07-2025,23:01:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1ltep71/norm_on_mentioning_names_when_working_with_client/
Glue work,"Hello,

Thank you for anyone who is reading this. Im being managed by a new manager and Im feeling misaligned.

I have been doing a lot of glue work ( taking notes, reminding people of follow ups, admin/ secretary work, building things in the domain ect). The second I was gone for two days, deadlines weren’t met as the other midlevel didnt bother to do it as he said he was doing prep work. He has a higher title than me. The senior lead was doing prep work and said it was because they were doing prep work because I was gone for two days things weren’t done. She also hasn’t been keeping track for the follow ups. When this occurred, everything went sideways, and a senior manager escalated his concerns and said nobody was keeping track of the follow ups and chastised her. Its not my role but i did send a follow up document compiling what I could.

Now, my manager keeps on presenting stuff as learning and growth opportunities and said to absorb some of the  (mid level) duties. I don’t see a promotion or even a salary increase in my future and I think my manager and the team knows that I can perform the work. In the past, my manager criticized my note taking, avoids career conversations with me. He is very new to the role and Im tired of trying ti talk to him.

My manager said he would even accompany me to do the work and said I need to own things even though its not my duty, its the midlevels. I dont want to do anymore glue work and I feel the second that I stopped doing it for two days.

Im at a loss of what to do. I tried pushing back on my manager that this was someone else’s role but he said I needed to do it even though there is an agreement saying its another persons role. I signed it. What can I do in my situation? How much glue work is reasonable in consulting?

Tony Blair’s staff took part in ‘Gaza Riviera’ project with BCG,"Insanely dystopian. I’m not going to draw historical parallels but I’m sure you are all smart enough to do so yourself. Some of the craziest excerpts:

“The plan outlined in a slide deck, seen by the Financial Times, was led by Israeli businessmen and used financial models developed inside Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to reimagine Gaza as a thriving trading hub.
Titled the “Great Trust” and shared with the Trump administration, it proposed paying half a million Palestinians to leave the area and attracting private investors to develop Gaza.”

Any opinions on going from consulting to tech sales?,"I was a Sales Development Representative at a small tech company for a few months, it wasn't too bad, overall I'd say I enjoyed it.

Now, I have switched to being a consultant, software consultant specifically, something very similar to being an ERP consultant. However I hate my life, the work-life balance sucks and I realized I'm terrible at handling deadline for deliverables. I miss having a monthly quota to hit, I just felt more free having to deal with that VS having to deal with billable hours and deliverables.

So I'm thinking about going back to being an SDR. Anyone who switched from consulting to tech sales or vice versa have any feedback?

Truthfully, I wouldn't say I was a particularly great SDR, but I also never did it for very long and didn't try as hard as I should've. I'm also aware SDR purgatory is a thing which is also holding me back, I'm scared I'll still be an SDR in 4 years rather than an Account Executive.

Questions about market fit and lead generation for starting my own consultancy in DS/ML space,"**Tl;dr**: Thinking about going it alone as a consultant, and looking for some advice/reality checks. I’ve been a consultant before on the technical side, but top of funnel sales is new to me. (Also apologies if this isn't the best subreddit to post on, I'm new here. Feel free to redirect me if so).

**More context**: a group of friends (Data Scientists, ML Engineers and Software Engineers) would essentially like to find consulting projects to do on the side, and go full time if we get enough business. We work at 2^(nd) tier companies (non-FAANG tech or big non-tech companies) and we’re lead engineers or above with \~10 to 15 years of experience. I’ve been a technical architect at a consulting company, where I designed solutions and led implementation, so I'm comfortable with what happens after getting a lead and initial discussions. I realize I have a lot of questions, if you’re able to provide any insight on any one question individually even it would be greatly appreciated, as I'm trying to decide if this is a pipe dream or not.

* While we have established brands on our resume (i.e. companies we’ve worked at), we would be starting a new consultancy, so no brand and no success stories (not even a website at this point). This will obviously be a challenge, but is it insurmountable? For which customers would this not be a deal breaker?
* Does the following market fit make any sense: my thinking is that we’ll be very competitive on price compared to major consultancies, but our customers would still be getting top notch technical skills. Some people want the best (or at least the best brand) and will pay for it – we can’t compete for them. Some will be focused on getting really inexpensive services, and they’re going to be looking for outsourced developers. But I’m thinking there’s a middle ground, where we’re attractive because you can get excellent developers, same time zone and no culture/language barrier, but a lot less expensive than elite consultancies. Am I being delusional?
* For pricing, I was thinking of charging somewhere around $150-$200/hour. Does that more or less fit with the market segment I described above?
* How much of a deal-breaker would it be that we have day jobs? Obviously we won’t consider projects where there’s a conflict of interest, but I imagine a significant percent of potential customers are going to immediately say no to not being able to dedicate 100% of time to the work. My hope is that it’s context/project dependent, and we can still find work that we can do part time.
* I’m quite new to the lead generation aspect of this. I’m trying to figure out who to reach out to, and how, for data science/machine learning projects. If this is answered already elsewhere, feel free to redirect me. I’m trying to decide:
   * Which level should I reach out to? (director, VP, CTO, etc)
   * Which departments? (Marketing, analytics, engineering etc)
   * Which medium? (Someone recommended buying email lists from Zoominfo or sending InMails on LinkedIn)
   * Which kinds of companies would be most open to this? (I realize this is a tough one to answer, it depends. But any rules of thumb would help.)",Dapper-Kitchen-6225,1lsrr35,consulting,06-07-2025,03:39:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1lsrr35/questions_about_market_fit_and_lead_generation/

"So, how fired am I after being let go three weeks into a project?","I started at my new firm in March.  With everything going on, a lot to work was cut back.  However, I was lucky enough to get staffed on a project I had all the right skills for.  I was extremely excited, since I worked with the client in the past and excelled.  However, the start date kept being pushed out.  I was assigned to the role and thus, couldn't be considered for other roles but after a month, I was told they decided to go with an internal client.  It's now the end of April.  The same MD who wanted me on the prior project pushed me onto a similar project, once again with the same client.  I had three interviews and they all went really well; I ended up being staffed pending final sign off.  And the same thing happened.  The role fell through, through nothing of my own fault but it was now the end of May and I was panicking.  

I was considered for three roles, all of which seemed very project manager/program manager.  Out of the three, there was one role I like less than the others.  This role I had interviewed for and on my client interview, deep financial analysis and modeling was mentioned.  I was completely honest and mentioned I hadn't done such work since my time at a bank 7 years ago and, even if, it was not on a CIO-senior level.  My interviewer, who was very nice and from the client side, laughed this off but I kept trying to explain I did not know how to do this sort of work autonomously on the CIO level, which seemed to be clearly needed for this role.  Worse, the other two roles I would have been perfect for were now told I was potentially being booked to this role and found other candidates.  I was then told I was being booked to this role.  Once again, I reached out and said nicely I didn't know how to do the work.  I was told I'd get help from in the firm and most of the work (as stated on our internal application sit would have been perfect for me, but it did not fit in with the work mentioned during the client interview which I said I had only done a little bit a while back.  

I immediately told the MD on my side I did not know how to do the work mentioned on the interview and was worried.  Her reply was ""don't worry,""  and then, when I got my first assignment, nothing I had ever done, to connect me to people in my firm to help.  

This was great but this was a role sold as a project management role  For the three weeks I was on the role, I did one PJ ppt in 3 hours and the rest was financial modeling and hard analysis.  I was out of my depth, something I had reminded my superiors before I got the role since after the interview, it did not seem like a PM/BA/PO role.

This Wednesday the boss from my company who assigned me to the role even after I did say I was worried and couldn't do the work told me I was off the project.  

So, I guess I am now getting fired.  I have never been let go from a project, let alone in three week.  I have no idea how to even face my co-workers.  I had 4 chances of getting a role I would have wanted (2 of which I fought for) and I was put on a role I said from the start I did not have the skills for and had NO overlap with the job description.  

As this point what would you do?  Resign?  How would you even face your coaches and mentors?  I literally want to die because of what a nightmare this is and in a time when people are fighting for jobs and can't get employed, I'm about to be fired.

EY: 6 weeks fully paid leave, 33 weeks at 50% of pay (if comparing like for like against the others, I guess this is the same as 22 weeks full pay)

How do you overcome an untrue negative feedback?,"I’ve finished a project recently for a client. Their team was incompetent throughout. For example, something could take 1 week to do, they would take 8 weeks. At one stage, we had to wait for few months for them to get  back to us about something. Despite all that, we delivered the project on time by working day and night to meet the deadline. 

Now they went to talk to our upper management and gave false feedback, which are lies about things that we didn’t do. Just so they don’t look bad within their org and cover their incompetence. They even complained about our cost, seeking for discount.

This made me feel so disheartened and shocked in a way how they could just lie on their negative feedback and without thinking the consequences on our team. We literally got yelled at a meeting with our upper management because how it made our leadership team looked bad in front of the client and their bigger boss.

Do you guys actually do that much after hours extras?,"I was sat in a meeting today and the senior manager a few times now has suggested that we should all do some after work reading around our industry and present it on Fridays. 

I'll be honest. My first thought was 'get f*cked' and it made me realise that I've become a bit disenchanted with it all. 

I used to do coding practice after work. Reading around my subject matter area. Things like that. 

Now honestly, it's just become a job. And I don't want to have to do any more than I need to. I have no interest in promotion in this company (big 4) and I actively dislike my seniors. I just want to do what I have to do in my contracted hours and leave. Which I know tbh is not good. But I'm not convinced that the hammering yourself for hours after 6pm is the way to go. I also didn't actually choose this industry, they just shoved me into it now won't seem to give me projects on other things. 

Anyone else feel this way? Starting to think I need to leave where they actually promote that kind of lifestyle. Or I feel a little more passionate about.

Day rate vs hourly rate,"Maybe a stupid question but I haven't encountered this before. I've been recruited as an advisor for a large private equity. I've done this before (for other private equities) and they've always paid me an hourly rate (as a 1099 contractor). 

This one has this language in the contact in terms of payment: 

""$X per eight (8) hour day worked at (PE's) request""

Does this mean it will be prorated if I work less than an 8 hour day? Or that I'll be paid $X when they request an 8 hour day, regardless of how much time I actually work? 

The amount is about the same as my regular hourly rate if you break it down. 

Of course I will ask for clarification before signing, but I'm wondering if this is somewhat standard language that I just hadn't encountered yet.

Three years in consulting and still unsure if I’ve excelled or just met the baseline.,"Hi all! I’m feeling a bit stuck in my current role and could use some career advice. Current role: Nearly 3 years as a UX designer in the federal space (consulting). Previous experience: About 4 years at startups.

In my current position, I’ve led design efforts that contributed to winning contracts totaling around $20M (individual deals ranging from $1.5M to $12M). “Led” might be a stretch since I’m the sole designer, but I’m client-facing and collaborate daily with developers, PMs, and general consultants. Team sizes have ranged from 4 to 30 people.

I’m currently earning $95K total comp, working fully remote in a high cost of living city. No client travel. I enjoy the work and my team, but I need to be making more and that won’t happen with my current employer (I’m at a Forbes Top 100 company, for context).


Here’s what I’m struggling with:
	1.	I want to apply elsewhere, but I honestly don’t know how my experience stacks up. I’m proud of what I’ve done, but I don’t know how it reads on a resume — especially in consulting. It seems like y’all are winning way more contracts! 
	2.	Is it even worth trying to switch jobs right now given the economy? Or should I just keep my head down and accept the lower pay for now?
	3.	How do I stand out in this job market? I’ve been working on AI-related design projects for the past 1.5 years. How can I better position that experience to attract recruiters or potential employers?

Confused - Let Go from Booz,"Trying to make sense of this and just need to vent.

At booz for 2+ years now and 15 months in I switched teams for better pay/experience.

5 months go by on new team and I got positive feedback and even a nice % raise. 

Month 6 I get some small constructive criticism at a standard review and hastley make adjustments.

Month 7 no updates since and everything is normal. Called randomly to be informed im let go from contract due to 'performance' which is the first im hearing of this. No preformance notes just client wants me off. Following day im let go from the firm.

Confused, angry and betrayed to say the least. Feels like some inside job happened just to remove me.

Pivoted into Fractional CTO consulting after 25 years in engineering - ask me anything or share advice,"I recently made the leap from full-time staff engineer to Fractional CTO.

I’d been thinking about it for years, but finally pulled the trigger once I realized:

- I loved mentoring and cross-team work more than deep IC work

- Founders often desperately need tech clarity without full-time hires

- I wanted more autonomy, variety and long-term impact

Now I work 10–15 hrs/week with early-stage SaaS/startup teams - helping with architecture, infra, AI integration, and team coaching.

Would love to hear:

- Your experiences as fractional/independent consultants

- How you structure your retainers or short-term gigs

- What worked (and what didn’t) when you started out

Happy to answer anything in return - I’ve built real-time infra, wallets, observability systems, and spent a lot of time coaching dev teams.

**Edit 05/07:**

I've had a few people ask if I offer a free 30-minute intro call. I appreciate the question, and I wanted to share my answer publicly in case it helps others:

**I don’t believe real value fits neatly into a calendar slot.**

Instead, my approach is simple:

I’ll work with you for as long as it takes to figure out where (or if) I can truly help your business.

That might be one meeting or a few async chats or it might take a bit longer if we need to dig into architecture, scaling challenges, or product/tech alignment.

If, at the end of that exploration, we both feel there’s value in working together, we’ll figure out a fair engagement.

If not, no worries, no charge. You’ll still leave with some clarity or recommendations you can use.

I care about helping first and only charging when it’s clear I’m making a meaningful difference.

If you’re a founder struggling with tech scaling, AI/product fit, or team enablement, happy to explore if I can help. And if not, hopefully I can point you to someone who can.",CarefulLight4214,1lpd4tf,consulting,01-07-2025,20:53:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1lpd4tf/pivoted_into_fractional_cto_consulting_after_25/

"Boutique Finance Consulting - Quant Risk, AI, Data Sicence","Hey all,

Looking for outside perspectives (especially from other consultants) on how I’m approaching building a boutique quant risk & data science consultancy.

My background is in Computer Science and I worked in finance as a “Risk Quant” / Data Scientist, building software and custom models. For the last year I’ve been solo, mostly building AI agent workflows, but I want to move away from “time for money” gigs and really leverage my specific skillset.

My goal is to build a **boutique consultancy** specializing in advanced risk modeling for lenders (regional banks, family offices, private credit) - not trying to do mass-market SaaS or race to the bottom on pricing. I’ve closed smaller consulting deals before and have experience with managing teams, marketing, and lead gen. But for something *considerably* higher-ticket, I’m wondering if my strategy is right:

1️⃣ Professional Website / LinkedIn (done)  
2️⃣ Case Studies: Building local market risk reports with my proprietary models, tailored to specific audiences  
3️⃣ In-Person Networking: I’m in an area with a high concentration of my ICP, so hoping to build real relationships

If anyone has experience in this type of B2B consulting sales, I’d love your thoughts. Specifically: **are case studies a good way to build trust (especially in finance)?** The idea is to leverage that trust into smaller paid projects, then retainers, and eventually larger custom build-outs.",Revolutionary_Let833,1lomet3,consulting,30-06-2025,23:17:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1lomet3/boutique_finance_consulting_quant_risk_ai_data/

I hate it here,"Never thought I'd be the one writing this—I've been lurking here forever, reading all those ""I hate consulting"" posts and feeling for everyone else. But I genuinely didn't expect I'd reach my own breaking point this early. I'm almost at the one-year mark as an associate at an MBB, and honestly, I'm completely burned out.

Literally every project or support week I've been on has been brutal beyond words. My typical day kicks off at 9 AM and doesn't wrap up until 1-2 AM. I stopped counting the number of times I've pulled past 3 AM shifts, only to wake up a couple hours later and repeat the nightmare. Management loves dropping surprise meetings at 9 PM, casually throwing out tasks that obviously need hours of dedicated work—due by the morning, of course. It's exhausting and relentless. And don’t get me started on how on one assignment, it was so bad that i wasn’t able to get a lunch break (not even once) for a whole month, and my first meal would be around 6pm.

What makes it even worse is the total disrespect from management. Basic human decency and respect for boundaries are practically nonexistent, which is almost funny given that this industry brags endlessly about structured, clear communication. And to add insult to injury, there are coworkers here who treat burnout like a trophy, bragging about having no personal life, as if that's something to admire—all while churning out meaningless busywork.

The worst part is, I've been repeatedly told my performance is above what's expected for someone at my level and that I'm really good at what I do. But honestly, hearing that just makes me even angrier. What's the point of being praised in an environment that's this toxic and broken? I've reached a point of genuine, vivid anger—like shaking, can't-think-straight anger—over the sheer injustice and disrespect I'm experiencing daily.

My absolute low point was recently having to go to the ER right after work at 3 AM for stress-related heart issues (was putting it off then i literally felt like my chest was going to explode and had to physically stop working). My manager knew, but the insane part is my biggest concern in that moment wasn't even my health—it was how this would mess up my performance review. Even after I told my manager I was heading to the ER, he texted a superficial 'hope you feel better,' then immediately bombarded me with work questions until 5 AM. Unbelievable.

I'm exhausted, furious, and struggling to hide it professionally. Quitting immediately feels impossible, because leaving before completing a full year here seems career-suicidal.

I genuinely don't know what to do. Has anyone else here of a similar (early-ish) tenure been in a similar place?

Copy-Paste Tasks With Zero Clarity,"My manager assigned me a task to extract every text containing bullet points from 141 documents and compile them into an Excel sheet.

Frankly, I found it quite underwhelming, especially considering I’m a 1.5-year Junior on track to become Senior by December.

I completed the task in one day. But once I submitted it, she told me that she didn’t want all the bullet points from each text in a single cell—she wanted each bullet point to be in a separate cell. For context, that’s 141 texts, each with up to 10 bullet points.

I didn’t say anything at the time, but internally, I was like, *WTF*. During our one-on-one, I shared that I often feel unclear about the next steps in our projects—and this is a perfect example. It honestly feels like she doesn’t know what she needs at each phase of the project, and we’re left figuring things out as we go.

Reimbursement for full cost of Uber/Lyft before discounts/credits?,"I have Lyft Premium which gives me discounts on rides. I also have some other random Lyft credits that I earned from personal use.

My very good friend is executive chef at a new french restaurant, and I am going to consult to help start their bread program. I have been in conversation with my friend the chef for months now about what bread he wants, how to make it, ovens, equipment, etc. I am building recipes for them, and have for the past few weeks been in somewhat frequent conversation with them, answering questions and such. I will do a few days in person. I am not sure how to charge them for this work, given my unfarmiliarity and the fact that he is a close friend. I currently make around $27/hour at my main job.

stay or move for a 40% salary increase,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently in tech consulting at Deloitte, about to enter my second year. I’ve received an offer from another company(not in consulting) with a 40% salary increase, and I’m weighing whether it’s the right time to make a move.

Note that I’m actually very comfortable with my current team and I’ve had a positive experience so far; it‘s not like I‘m unhappy at Deloitte.

Part of me feels staying longer at Deloitte could strengthen my profile and position me for even better opportunities in the near future. On the other hand, the offer is financially attractive and would really improve my financial situation.

Quick correction: Benioff said AI now covers 30-50 % of tasks, not that he axed half the staff. Yet Salesforce still trimmed 1 k roles this year while hiring thousands for AI so the reshuffle is real.

Terrible startup,"Hi all

I just wanna vent on my current standing, pardon the terrible English...

I have been working at this European consulting company in the X region, it's like a startup but been like this for 15 years

We kicked off a proejct last month that original rfp requested 3 months and half, my partner wanted to make more money so we proposed 2 months and half

He is on the steerco, I lead the project with one resource, he resource resigned after the project kicked off, we have 6 deliverables, my wedding is 3rd week of July and I will go on leave on the 7th and I plan to go off the grid, the partner did not replace the resource that left, he himself went on vacation and will return on the 3rd week of July

I explained to him that the client is very pissed that we are slow, no much attention, the client PM is the kind that contact you everyday and monitor the project closely and I dropped the bomb that I am leaving 2nd week of July for my vacation and that someone else will continue the work

Now I am trying to progress as much as possible before I leave, told the partner that you are making a big mistake not enrolling anyone on the project as when I leave I will only be back first week of August and will not be able to support the team with any work at all, like there is someone anyway
His plans is to resume the project work after I get back from vacation despite the client expect things to wrap up at that point

I am not sure what to do more, I am planning to turn my phone off because I will not bother managing the client during my life event vacation",Former-Perspective82,1lltpuy,consulting,27-06-2025,13:20:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1lltpuy/terrible_startup/

Hidden benefit for you consultants with an Amex Corp Card: $50-$150/year statement credit on your personal Amex card,"Saw another thread on the corporate cards and realized not many people know about this. If you have an Amex \*corporate\* (not business) card and you work for anyone who isn't PwC (their auditor), you can get a $50-$150 statement credit on your personal Amex card every year you have your corporate card just by enrolling once. The personal card 'color' does NOT have to match the corporate card's 'color', and you don't have to be enrolled in the Membership Rewards program on the corporate card to qualify.

Assuming you already have a personal card, contact Member Services (the number on the back of your personal card) and ask to enroll in their [Corporate Advantage program](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/gcpadvantage/login/), If you don't have a card, you can apply with the NON-referral link I posted, but you'll probably find better offers elsewhere; add the statement credit to the card afterwards by calling in.

You can have multiple personal cards it applies to and it's the following amounts:

* Blue Cash Everyday: $50/year
* Green: $75/year
* Gold: $100/year
* Platinum: $150/year

Co-brand cards (e.g. Delta, Hilton) do not apply to this, nor do business Amex cards, nor other personal cards like the Everyday Preferred.

Advice needed,"Hi, 35M here, currently pre-Manager level at a T2. It will soon be 6 years that I will be at this level and I have just learnt that the firm will not promote me to Manager. Their decision needs to be framed in the context of my poor mental health which has made me take breaks on and off for about 2 years in the last 5 years. During this time, I have pivoted to an internal role rather than client-facing and now that I feel much better I was hoping that I could get promoted internally to Manager to then transition back to a client-facing team. My current understanding is that I would be able to go back to a client-facing team as long as I’m not promoted to Manager. What would you do? Should I stay, go back to client-facing and wait another year to get to Manager hoping everything goes for the best? Or should I rather start looking around? My entire tenure at the firm is more than 8 years. Any advice is appreciated, also when it comes to justifying the extremely long tenure to potential recruiters.

Burnout as an SM stretched on Sales + Delivery. Is this normal?,"Hi, i'm Senior Manager at a large consulting firm, currently staffed full-time on a client delivery engagement. Separately, I was asked to take on the role of engagement lead for a major HRO deal and I’ve been tasked with standing up the entire program: building timelines, aligning activities with the cost case, identifying resource needs, and setting the client up for success.

Here’s the problem: I wasn’t part of the solution design or sales cycle. The person who did lead the solutioning is still involved, but more as an exec sponsor, not active in delivery. I’ve been trying to piece together what was sold, what’s actually being implemented, and who’s even responsible for what. I’m talking gaps in ownership for key tech components, no clear staffing plan, and even ambiguity around basic timelines. I’m doing my best to drive clarity, ask questions, and escalate risks, but it feels like I’ve been thrown in to *own* an outcome without being given the foundation to do so.

I want to do right by the client and by my team. But juggling this on top of my other FULL TIME client work is honestly unsustainable, and I’m finding it hard to tell whether I’m failing… or if the situation itself is unreasonable.

**Is this kind of ambiguity and lack of handoff normal at the Senior Manager level? Should I be expected to fill in this many blanks? Or is this a sign that we’ve dropped the ball somewhere upstream?**

Would love to hear from others who’ve been in similar shoes especially on large, complex, multi-workstream transformation programs.

Seeking Advice on Executive Education Options & relocation?,"# Seeking Advice on Career Relocation and Executive Education Options

Dear All Members/Community/Leaders,  
  
IESE EMBA (Munich) vs Oxford MSc Major Programme Management vs Cambridge Mst Entrepreneurship   
  
Dear Community Members and Respected Leaders,

**Background:**

* **Education:**
   * Bachelor's in Business Administration (2008)
   * MBA (Non Target school from a low profile University which no one knows back in 2010) and i usually do not mention it in my CV.
   * MSc in Business Informatics (2018) from Furtwangen University in Germany
* **Professional Experience:**
   * 5 years in Oil & Gas
   * 4 years in Healthcare
   * Last 8 years in Management Consulting (5 years at Accenture, 3 years at Cognizant)
* **Current Role:** Senior Consulting Manager
* **Nationality:** German
* **Relocation Preferences:** 1) UAE, 2) KSA, 3) Switzerland

I am currently exploring options for a second master’s degree to enhance my professional profile and support my relocation goals. Based on my research and current financial considerations:

* **Best ROI (in my view):** IESE EMBA - Munich(18months)
* **Best brand recognition:** Oxford or Cambridge (Master’s programs) (18-24months)

I’ve actively applied to MBB, Tier-2 consultancies, and Big Four firms. While I’ve progressed through some initial interview rounds, most processes were halted due to hiring freezes, filled roles, or cancellations.

Some senior professionals have recommended pursuing an EMBA from a top-tier school such as INSEAD/LBS before reapplying. However, I am hesitant to invest €130K–€150K at this point. The IESE EMBA seems more feasible, with a total effective cost of around €47K after applying a €20K scholarship and tax benefits (€20K). The Oxbridge Master’s programs are also in a similar cost range. Moreover, I will not leave my job and thats why i am opting for part-time/executive programs.

I would greatly appreciate your insights and recommendations on:

* The value of pursuing a second master’s vs. waiting to get a job offer.
* EMBA vs. traditional master’s from a branding, longterm leadership corporate role and career ROI standpoint.
* Strategic guidance for consulting roles in my target geographies.

Thank you in advance for your valuable advice. Your guidance means a lot to me.

"I'm used to getting ghosted, but this one really got to me","I'm building my own consulting practice. I have over 25 years of experience in a certain niche of a larger industry. I have an extensive network. I've gotten clients opportunistically through word of mouth. Now I'm proactively seeking clients for the first time. 

I get ghosted a lot my prospective clients. I hate that this is now the norm, but it is what it is. 

A few weeks ago, I reached out to someone on LinkedIn who works for a company I worked for about 10 years ago (left on good terms), saying that I'd love to discuss his portfolio and some ideas I had for it. I don't know this guy personally but we know a lot of the same people. To my surprise, he responded and we had a call. 

We seemed to hit it off and he even asked if I'd consider coming to work for him (as an employee rather than a consultant) if they had an opening in the coming months. I said I'd consider it, and we decided I'd do some consulting work now and see where it led. He asked me for references and I gave him the names of two people we both know. He said he'd get back to me in a in a few days. 

Then nothing. 

I followed up on email and on LinkedIn. No response. He never reached out to the references, either. 

This one really pisses me off because we work in the same niche, in the same geographic area, and have the same network. We're bound to run into each other. Wtf is he thinking? I'm a consultant; you can just tell me it's not going to work right now. I get it.  But for fucks sake, why ghost me? Why can't people have even a modicum of professional courtesy anymore?

Leaving MBB Indonesia After 4 Years for a Tech Architect Role at a Fintech in Malaysia – What Should I Be Asking?,"Hi all,

I’ve been at an MBB firm (McKinsey/BCG/Bain) in Indonesia for about 4 years, focused on tech consulting. While it’s been a great learning experience, I’ve found myself plateauing—stuck at the same level for a while now, with limited opportunity for deeper technical growth.

Recently, I received an offer from a mid-to-late stage fintech startup in Malaysia for a Tech Architect role. They’re offering relocation support, equity, and the opportunity to work directly with engineering leadership on core system architecture.

It’s a big shift—from consulting to a hands-on, in-house technical leadership role in a product company. It sounds exciting, but before I accept, I want to make sure I’m thinking through the right things.

What should I be finding out before making this move?

Some questions on my radar:
	•	How stable is the company, both financially and strategically? It seems to be growing, but I want to understand the long-term outlook.

	•	What kind of influence does a Tech Architect actually have? Is it more implementation-focused or strategic?

	•	How developed is their tech culture—are they open to architectural change or still figuring things out?

	•	What does growth look like on the technical track?

	•	How do comp + equity compare to staying in consulting long-term?

	•	What’s the day-to-day like for an expat tech lead living in Malaysia?

If you’ve moved from MBB (or any consulting firm) to a startup—or made a cross-border tech career shift in Southeast Asia—I’d really appreciate any advice, lessons learned, or red flags to look out for.

Thanks so much!

Escalation on UI Mockups - All Blame Pinned on Me Despite Multiple Reviews. What Should I Do?,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently working as a consulting analyst, supporting a software implementation project as an offshore Business Analyst (BA). I joined my firm almost a year ago, so I have exactly one year of consulting experience post my post-grad. Prior to this, I worked as a software engineer.

As part of this engagement, I was tasked with creating UI mockups for the application. The mockups were designed to closely resemble the final application and were dynamic in nature. There is another consultant on the team with significantly more experience than me, along with three senior managers - one from the consulting side and two from the implementation side.

Here’s where it gets tricky:

* The project began with a discovery phase, followed by the creation of a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document by our team.
* The client never formally signed off on the SRS. Our team had communicated that if no response was received by a certain date, it would be considered signed off.
* I created the mockups based on the SRS and incorporated feedback from both internal stakeholders and a subset of the client team who reviewed them during calls.
* However, the client recently raised an escalation, saying they’re unhappy with the aesthetics of the mockups - even though there was never any guidance provided to me regarding the visual design.
* Now, the blame is being placed entirely on me. Despite the fact that all mockups were reviewed multiple times by our internal managers (including the experienced consultant) and feedback from client-side reviewers was incorporated, no one is taking ownership.
* The consulting-side senior manager is telling me I should have kept all review requests and approvals documented via email. Unfortunately, most feedback came over calls, and I don’t have email trails to back it up. I have a couple of group chat text messages though.

I feel blindsided and hung out to dry. I did the work in good faith, got it reviewed, incorporated feedback, and now I’m the scapegoat. I’m genuinely worried. Will this put my job at risk? Is there anything I can do to protect myself or at least explain my side of the story formally?

Would appreciate any guidance, especially from folks who’ve navigated similar situations.

How do you track invoices that need to be paid?,"This is driving me crazy and I'm wondering if I'm just bad at this.

My setup with my accountant: we have a shared Dropbox folder. Every month I dump all my invoices in there (stuff I send out + stuff I receive) and email her that it's ready.

Then she emails back ""you're missing 3 invoices"" and I'm like shit, what did I forget now? I go digging through emails, different platforms trying to find them.

The receiving invoices part is the worst. Some companies auto-charge and send you the invoice (Google Workspace, DigitalOcean, etc). Others send you an invoice that you actually need to pay manually. Then there's companies like OpenAI that don't even email invoices - you have to remember to log into their platform every month to grab it. Plus one-time purchases like domain names where I buy something and then need to remember to save that invoice to the right folder (I organize by year/month like 2025/05).

When I miss something my accountant sees the payment in my bank but no invoice, so she can't finish everything in one go and has to circle back. Since I pay her hourly, this back-and-forth gets expensive.

Failed,"I have about 4 years of consulting experience in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Initially worked at a firm after finishing my MBA and got laid off in 2022. Spent 2023 job searching and got a gig at a market research firm in Feb 2024.

I was fired yesterday due to poor performance. Part of it is my fault. I'll admit that life has gotten the best of me. My relationship with my wife isn't great right now and that's affecting me mentally. We just moved to a new house and above all we welcomed a baby girl who is 3 months old and the light of my life.

I guess the pressure of everything got to me. I've been trying to fix my relationship with my wife while learning how to be a dad and setting up a new house. I missed some deadlines and was candid with my manager about it.

He seemed to understand and gave me feedback on where I needed to improve that I was actively working on and felt like I was making progress. On Friday I had my regularly scheduled 1 on 1 with my manager when HR and the CFO joined and I was fired.

I failed my daughter. I failed my wife. I failed myself. I failed my family. I feel like such a loser. I haven't even told my wife yet because it would just make her see me as even less than how I already feel. I just don't want to add to her stress and cause more problems between us.

In this job market, there's no way I'm getting another gig. I just wanted to vent. Idk how I'm going to provide for my daughter. Part of me wants to drown my sorrows in a whiskey glass. The other part of my wants to keep fighting. Idk.

How do you value a business when competitors are literally giving away alternatives?,"Watching the VMware situation unfold, and the competitive response is fascinating. Scale Computing offering 25% discounts for VMware refugees, Red Hat pushing open-source alternatives, even smaller players like Proxmox gaining enterprise traction.

This creates a weird valuation puzzle:

Broadcom paid $61B for VMware's market position and customer lock-in. But if customer acquisition costs for competitors drop to near-zero (because customers are actively fleeing), how sustainable is that moat?

It's like watching a high-margin monopoly get disrupted in real-time, except the disruption is self-inflicted through pricing strategy.

From a valuation perspective, how do you model this?

Do you:

* Assume customer base shrinks but remaining customers pay premium prices?
* Factor in long-term competitive erosion as alternatives mature?
* Trust that switching costs ultimately keep customers captive?

The math seems to depend entirely on how elastic demand really is at these price points. r/MergerAndAcquisitions ",mrlawofficer,1lh30q6,consulting,21-06-2025,18:14:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1lh30q6/how_do_you_value_a_business_when_competitors_are/

I am thinking of saving up 100 grand, and coastfiring. I’ll live in the hood for a while, save every dollar, and coastfire back in my home country. 100k at 23 will be millions when I’m 60, and that can let me live like a king back home.

Advice: How to frame quitting email while on a Leave Of Absence?,"I've worked within professional services for the past 5 or so years, half of which I have spent in consulting across the public service in my region (not US). I'm at a senior associate level, achieved about 3 years in, which may seem like a long time to get here but this was due to (1) being an undergraduate for 1.5 years and (2) delaying promotion in my old team to be able to jump business lines. Those that I've worked along with believe I have been operating at this level for a while.

During this time I have worked for the same Big 4 employer. Over the last few years, my firm has gone through a lot of changes and things haven't really been the same.

Things really started to go south when the restructuring began. A lot of skilled people left, my pipeline was in question, and 5+ rounds of redundancies occurred. Gratefully I was the only person at my level to be promoted during this uncertainty. I ended up changing teams, moving away from a team I loved as I thought this was a good opportunity to focus on skills I wanted to learn. This new team looked good on paper and approved my several months LOA to go travelling that I told them I wanted to do as I was moving across. However, in truth it feels like it has been a mistake and my LOA I came very close to mental breakdown and quitting due to a nightmare engagement.

Before I left, I spoke with my therapist and friends about quitting and came up with a game plan to earn an income once I am back if I decided to pull the trigger. The work would be in unrelated fields to my profession but will definitely keep me going until I find new work. I also have networks to lean on, who know my work ethic and performance history, to help me find employment. 

I am now in the middle of my leave of absence and I want to pull the trigger, but I don't know how to word the email. I know of others who have left while on LOA abroad but have no clue how they did it. I want to ask each of you - How would you frame this email to your boss? I don't want to burn bridges but I think returning will just make me feel stuck. 

If you want to offer your thoughts on staying versus leaving I am also open to that but I always ruminate on the cons more than the pros anyway.

Managing a project for tough SVP lady. 

SOW full of “just the tip”, “high level descriptions only” and other vague terms. But work starts ok. 

The first deliverable is met with the craziest directions to the consultants. Over and over. Says it’s all wrong. Asks to be redone. Says it’s still wrong.  

She gets progressively mad and says she may ask the whole company to cancel all other contracts with said consultants. 

But there’s a remedy: they could do stuff that wasn’t covered in the SOW. 

And THAT is when the work started. 

Unlimited hours applied. Unlimited consultants involved. Unlimited scope. 

Lesson learned: the work only starts when consultants loose all leverage, and work blindly to salvage other ongoing contracts. 

Free work, basically, paid by the prospect of future earnings with more work across the organization. They’ll do whatever it takes.

Started my IT consultancy — now figuring out how to land the next client (especially in the Gulf market),"Hey everyone,  
I recently took the leap and started my own IT consultancy. It's been something I’ve been planning for a while, and now that I’m finally doing it, it’s a mix of excitement and uncertainty. Currently, I’m working with a client in the fintech industry, and things are going well on that front.

But as I’m working through this project, a question keeps nagging at me: *what happens after this?*  
How do I make sure there’s another project lined up? I know this is a common struggle for a lot of freelancers and consultants, especially in the early days.

So far, I’ve been relying on cold outreach to find leads. Mostly LinkedIn DMs—targeting people based in the Gulf region (mainly Dubai), especially folks in real estate and finance.  
I deliberately chose the Gulf market instead of the US for now. My reasoning? The competition in the US feels much denser, and I feel the Gulf market still has room for lean, tech-focused consultants. Also, from what I’ve seen and heard, budgets in that region are decent.

But despite my efforts—writing thoughtful messages, customizing outreach, keeping things short and relevant—I haven’t really gotten much traction. Barely any replies. No solid leads yet. I get it, people are busy. But it’s been a bit disheartening, not going to lie.

So, I wanted to reach out here and ask:  
**How do** ***you*** **onboard new clients?**  
Do you have a system or process you follow?  
Do you rely on referrals, content, communities, ads, or something else entirely?

I’d love to hear how others manage that “what next” phase—especially if you’re solo or just starting out. Any practical advice, honest stories, or even mistakes to avoid would be super helpful.

Thinking of leaving consulting but stuck on what’s next? Here’s what helped me.,"In 2020, I realized I was building my career on someone else’s definition of success.

I was working at a top consulting firm in what I thought was my “dream job.”

In hindsight, I had forced myself to believe that narrative.

I stopped enjoying my work and kept chasing a promotion that never came.

I didn’t know what *I* wanted. I only knew what looked good to everyone else.

I didn’t quit right away. Instead, I started having honest conversations with friends, mentors, people who’d felt the same. We talked about misalignment, values, identity.

That changed everything.

I stopped optimizing for what sounded good on LinkedIn and started trying to find what actually *fit*.

Here’s what helped me:

1. **Stop searching for job titles.** Look for patterns in what energizes you, drains you, and repeats across your past roles.

Am I being underpaid at BAH?,"Early career, no degree, hired by Booz Allen with ~3 years of prior IT/dev experience. I came in at around $80K base and received a COL raise this year. My clearance was upgraded to TS/SCI shortly after joining, but there was no salary adjustment, I’m assuming because of the client’s labor category.

Recently spoke with a recruiter from another defense contractor about a role that listed $120K–$160K, but they said the best they could offer was ~$90K due to no degree. That kind of threw me off and now I’m not sure what’s “normal” compensation for my background.

I’ve got Sec+, a TS/SCI, and approaching 4 years of overall experience. Should I focus on picking up another cert (maybe AWS or K8?) or just start applying elsewhere? I’d also consider switching contracts internally, but I’m not sure how that works at Booz, and I can’t really talk openly since my job lead and career manager are the same person.

Appreciate any insight!

**UPDATE:**
Appreciate all the feedback. After reading through everything, I actually looked into WGU just a few hours later and I’m now planning to enroll in their Software Engineering program. I originally thought school would take years and wouldn’t be worth it, but seeing that I can finish in under a year while working full-time changed things for me. The degree lines up with the kind of work I already enjoy (coding, automation, building things), and I believe Booz can help pay for it too. Didn’t expect this post to shift my whole plan, but here we are.",Key-Ant-6319,1lfgilq,consulting,19-06-2025,17:21:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1lfgilq/am_i_being_underpaid_at_bah/
Exits: CoS @ $350K cash + $200K/yr equity (5y vest),"Currently an MBB Manager (U.S.) with an HSW MBA in good standing, about a year from promotion. I have solid senior support and a real (not guaranteed) path to partner in ~4 years, which would put comp in the $600–800K range if I stick it out.

That said, a Chief of Staff role just came up at a leading investor in an industry I care about. It’s not a startup (relatively stable platform) and equity is bought back every quarter, making it functionally cash (albeit with some downside risk). Cash comp is roughly equivalent to what I make now, with some upside if the equity is realized (that’s $200K in equity granted every year, that’s vests over 5.)

Would love a market check, it feels like a strong opportunity given comp + relevance of firm/industry, but I’d appreciate some sanity-checking. What are others seeing?

Concerns:

	•	It’s a 3-year ask. That feels long for a CoS gig

	•	The firm and industry are in a down cycle (recent layoffs, difficult fundraising environment, market pressure on portcos). CEO/founder could lose board support. My role is probably safe, but the real risk is spending 3 years firefighting and not building a seat or strategic platform for myself. (Limited opportunity for transaction experience, but likely to do M&A and corp dev 

	•	That said, if I emerge in 3 years with a board and exec team in this space who know I’m smart, hardworking, and effective — is that enough of a launchpad at 36?

For context: I turned down an Associate Director strategy/ops role in a non-core industry at $270K all-in — felt like a ceilinged role with limited growth.

Appreciate any thoughts — especially from folks who’ve made (or passed on) a similar leap.

Do consultants always say Yes?,"I am working for a research and consulting firm and my manager, idk why he always say yes to whatever clients ask and the best part is he never charges or mention about extra charges to client in any way for the extra work done.

Even for in depth project, his sales pitch is like whatever budget you say I'll put it and this leads to doing work of say $30,000 while our quote is merely $5,000. 

Is this way consulting projects or work happens? Idk I just feel drained and feel like we are charging pennies for the work which maybe top consulting firms charge like crazyy!

LMM Consulting Rates,"Hi all,

Just graduated this past weekend with my MBA, have about 7 years of corporate finance and strategy experience, (am still employed full time as well) and am leaning into consulting projects that are flowing my way from various places. I’ve already completed one financial modeling project (rebuilt IS, SCF, and assumptions, along with member acquisition model rolling into revenue) this year that went fairly well. I charged that guy $75/hr since he was a friend, but he was willing to pay $100. This was after ChatGPT told me to charge $200 (seems high for this market).

I’m going to start a formal entity of some sort, be it an LLC or s corp.

I’ve linked up with a guy who has proprietary deal flow from his business, and is building a consulting shop to capitalize on it. He’s willing to give me project based work as needed since they aren’t fully up and running yet. Ideally might be able to have that be my full time role in the future.

Questions for the group:

1. Any general advice?

2. Any thoughts on llc vs. s corp?

3. How much should I be charging on an hourly basis?

4. For project based rates, how do you back into what the quote should be? I see a lot of people posting that they undercharge on an hourly basis to keep the client happy. Is this standard or just a result of under-bidding?

"Career Advice Needed: Love My Consulting Role, But the Pay Is Unsustainably Low — What Are My Options?","Hi everyone,
I’m looking for some career advice from fellow consultants who’ve maybe been in my shoes.

I’m a Human Capital Consultant with two years of experience. I’m based in North Africa, working remotely to support projects across the Middle East, i have worked within complex industries like aviation, healthcare, Oil and gas, etc.., The setup is essentially a regional hub model — our cost base is lower, so we handle many deliverables from here.

Despite the setup, I feel genuinely lucky:
• I have an outstanding manager and team.
• I’m getting real exposure to complex, high-impact projects — especially in organizational development and total rewards.
• The learning curve has been steep in the best way, and I absolutely love the client engagement side of things (possibly because of my previous background in sales).

The problem: the pay is shockingly low. Like, “barely cover the basics” kind of low.

I don’t want to leave my current team or this path — I see huge growth potential here, and I’m not ready to sacrifice the technical development or mentorship I’m getting. But financially, something has to give.

I’ve been brainstorming ideas like:
1. Freelancing in parallel (e.g., HR operations support for other clients or companies).
2. Applying to better-paying firms in the same field (e.g., Korn Ferry, WTW, etc.), but that feels like a medium-to-long term move.

So here’s what I’m hoping to get advice on:
• Has anyone pulled off freelance or part-time HR consulting while working full-time at a firm — without burning out or risking their main job?
• Are there better ways to increase income without compromising technical growth or leaving a great team too early?
• How can I make myself more attractive to Tier 1 firms without jumping too soon and losing current learning opportunities?

Would love any perspectives — especially from those who’ve navigated early-career consulting while balancing financial and growth goals.

"Best Path to PE Ops? Big 4 Analyst Weighing MBB, Product, MBA, or IB","Hi everyone, I’d really appreciate some insight as I try to map out my next few steps.

Entering my 2nd year as a consulting analyst at a Big 4 (federal side).

T25 undergrad, CS major

My long-term goal is to transition into a value creation role on a PE Ops team (ideally MM or MF), not just to do number-heavy due diligence, but to become someone who truly understands how to create value post-acquisition.

I’m trying to figure out what route best positions me for that goal. Weighing a few different ideas:

Currently at Big 4:
- Focused on operational consulting (some digital transformation work)
- Either trying to get staffed on PE DD projects when possible or focus my expertise in AI

Routes I’m considering:
- Big 4 > MBA > MBB > PE Ops
- Big 4 > MBA > IB > PE Ops
- Big 4 > MBB > PE Ops
- Big 4 > Product > MBA > PE Ops

Questions:
- How should I continue my path at Big 4? Find PE DD/M&A work or dive into AI (to bring unique experience later in PE)
- Which career path(s) is best? 
- Am I overestimating the value of MBB if my end goal is operational PE value creation?
- Is there a “too late” age-wise to break into PE Ops (e.g., 28-30+)? I don’t want to be stuck later on just breaking in while others are already mid-level.

Ethics of using AI to improve presentations & writing,"I know we're probably all sick of talking about AI, but I'm coming up against a bit of a professional/personal tension re using AI to improve my work, and I'm curious to hear thoughts.

Bit of context:

I am a consultant by day for a tech agency, and the majority of my work involves presentation writing (slide after slide after slide). My company encourage all of us to use AI to improve our work – they've even started sending a newsletter round for how we can use AI to improve our general workflow or presentations.

Long story short, I now use these tools daily to improve my sentence structures. I have a lot of deadlines and a fairly meaty workload with little support (I am a team of 2, and we're stretched). When I'm really stretched for time, I use it to help me generate ideas and I adapt and/or combine the best ones. I don't think I could achieve the work I do without AI – which makes me feel uncomfortable.

The tension: In my personal life I write a bit. Nothing crazy, just observations on things I find interesting and the like. It's something I do for fun to keep my brain ticking over. However, I've been using AI to help me improve sentence structures or help me write conclusions. I ask it for recommendations on where I could cut or move my structure around. It's useful.

Now, I know Writing Reddit is very puritanical about AI. I get it – AI's built on stolen ideas and writings, and writing itself is a craft. Using a tool to help you with that feels cheap and morally wrong. I know many people will read this and think 'just work on your own writing and stop using AI, easy.'

This is where I'd like thoughts. Where do I draw the line over what is and isn't ethical? I want to be good at my job; I also want to improve my personal writing. Both have conflicting ideas of what an ethical process looks like.

Burnt Out at Senior Manager – Exploring Chief of Staff Roles,"Hey all – I’ve posted here before, but I’m reaching a breaking point and looking to pivot *out* of consulting entirely.

**TL;DR:** I made Senior Manager about six months ago. I’ve been in consulting for 6 years, and I have 14 years of total experience across industries—all with a people/HR/employee experience lens. I specialize in org design, effectiveness, and large-scale transformations.

Since being promoted, though, it’s been nonstop. I'm worn down from the split attention, constant travel, relentless BD pressure (urgent BD requests falling out of the sky), and increasingly unrealistic expectations. I barely have time to think, let alone breathe. I’m currently staffed on an intense, high-profile engagement and am just feeling completely depleted. 

I’ve started looking at Chief of Staff roles—ones tied to operations, people strategy, or even product orgs (I have experience with HRIS and employee experience tech products). It feels like a space where I could use my skills in a more focused, impactful way.

Passing the value of AI back to the customer,"I’m in an interesting situation.  I’m a freelance consultant.  I’ve set a few systems up with AI where a months worth of work can be delivered in an hour.  

I am still adding a fair bit of experience and knowledge into the process and have also developed these systems, but it puts me in a strange situation.

I could price my projects based on 1 day to reflect the new world, 30 days as it was before and keep the upside, or 7-15 days and split the difference.  I can choose how aggressively to change that dial.  

I could try to price things as purely outcome based and totally disregard T&M, but there’s even a choice there how much value I pass back to the client then when $50k of work from last year can now be delivered in an afternoon.   

I could just jump in with both feet and pass all of the value back to my clients, turning that $50k project into a $3k project which still maps to an exceptional day rate.  I would need a lot of clients though if I was operating at that velocity.

AI's impact on the consulting industry - a partner's perspective,"Not going to dox myself, so all I'll say is I'm a Partner at a large US firm and have been in consulting (across 3 firms) for 25+ years.

What seems to get missed in all these discussions is that whether or not ""AI can replace everything you do as a consultant"" is largely irrelevant.  The future of consulting as an industry depends on two factors:

1) The impact of AI on the leverage model AKA The Pyramid.  Consulting firm profitability depends on the Partner:Staff ratio.  Different types of firms will see varying impacts, see David Maister's Managing The Professional Services Firm for the main archetypes.  We make money by billing out junior consultants at inflated rates (relative to cost) not by billing expensive (cost-wise) Partners and Senior Managers out as senior SMEs.

2) Productivity gain sharing between firms and clients.  The idea that the AI enabled firm of the future will consist of far fewer staff using AI tools to create deliverables and firms would somehow be able to capture most of the gain while only passing a small part of it on to clients in the form of lower prices was a nice thought in 2023, but clients have wised up.

Don't think of AI in terms of the work you do on a day to day basis, think in terms of its impact on your firm's economics.  This is how your firm's Managing Partners are viewing it.",FuguSandwich,1lb8k0n,consulting,14-06-2025,13:19:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1lb8k0n/ais_impact_on_the_consulting_industry_a_partners/
Comparing every use of time to my Billing Rate Rabbit Hole,"I just started working in AEC Consulting as an intern. Now that my time is charged to project(s)/case(s) and I see my billing rate, I have begun to compare everything in my life to my billing rate: Is going to this mall with friends worth X hours of my billing rate? What is the fiscal opportunity cost of doing this? Is me asking a higher up for help or a coffee chat worth their billing rate? I am a bit slower at this task then I could be; is that fair to charge that to a client?

"Client wants me to work for them, how do you stop their constant offers?","As the title suggests a client really likes me and has wanted me to work for them for 2 years. Recently, they outright ask me in every 2nd or 3rd call what it will take to recruit me. The answer is honestly nothing I want to be diversified across projects and I don’t want to work for a company at this time, which is something I continue to stress but the price and the position level/responsibilities keep going up. It’s been causing me a lot of anxiety, I try to be nice because I still have to work with them every single day but the constant disappointment when I say no and questions is driving me insane. What are things you may have said to permanently shut down the questions without being too aggressive? 

What makes this whole situation worse is there is someone from my firm causing harm to the firm (in my opinion). This person tells client employees about drama, issues, etc within my firm. So client thinks we work in the Wild West and thinks they are “saving me”. I believe they think my constant nos is because I’m scared or feel stuck.

"Consultant leading broken stream, client insulted me — should I step off?","I’m a manager-level consultant, 10+ years into my career. I’ve delivered across multiple industries and programs — mostly in technical and transformation-heavy environments. I joined a new firm earlier this year and was staffed straight onto this project.

I’m leading a core workstream on a large, high-pressure rollout. The setup has been messy from the beginning:
– late and uncontrollable scope changes without leadership support
– Dependency on other streams but without leadership support
- Client counterpart not driving the stream 
- Zero boundaries for how consultants are treated 

Despite this, I’ve kept things moving. Delivered my scope through &, raised risks early

Last week, the client’s program lead insulted me directly in a meeting. It was unprovoked. No pushback from leadership on my side. 

On top of this, I’ve been dealing with a family health situation since April. I’ve been managing it quietly while keeping delivery on track, but the combined weight of personal and project stress is starting to show — mentally and physically.

I’m considering stepping off the project ASAP

Would appreciate honest views on:
– How a decision like this tends to be perceived (internally and externally)
– Whether to frame the exit as delivery-driven, health-driven, or both
– What not to say when I communicate this

"Struggling in my career. My brain overcomplicates problems, leading to poor outcomes.  Help!","I work for a niche research and consulting firm. Much of my career has been as researcher and content creator of guidelines, frameworks, training, methodologies, insights, etc. Which means I quit actually practicing in business 10 years ago. So my POV is stunted and I’ve been thought leading in very emerging practices. 

I’ve done well because my work is thorough, but I struggle getting to solutions quickly. It’s like I have to study the depth before I can act. So it’s slow and complicated, and outputs miss the mark of actionability and clarity.

Interestingly, when I use cannabis for stress, it’s like it unlocks my mind. The problem that I was totally overcome by all day. Totally overwhelmed in the weeds on. All of the sudden things become clear. It’s like. Duh. I just gotta do this and say this and just solve the problem this way. 

I also get overwhelmed by the client management aspect of my job and because we work in innovation, often I have to make expert-level decisions without expert-level experience. 

It takes a toll on me. Why can’t I just relax and think straight? Often my outcomes are good enough, but I need to see how I improve this. To be more confident and more conceptual, a higher level problem solver. Maybe I can’t solve this, but why don’t I have the”fake it til you make it” in me.

PIP at ZS,"I got my performance review today and I'm going to be placed in a 2 month PIP starting end of this month. I just want to know what are the chances of someone getting out of this successfully and excelling in their job there after.

Context:

My first cycle ( year end 2024) was slightly behind expectations. I had only worked on 2 projects and 1 was not great as it was not in my field of interest or knowledge.

My second cycle (June 2025)  says behind expectations as one of my projects went bad due to burn out and I lacked on certain aspects in a few other projects. 

Positive things:
1. I have improved on some areas since my first cycle. Overall, there is growth.
2. I am 100% staffed until the end of July (at least until the first month of my PIP) 
3. I'm definitely performing better than I did a few months ago

Negatives:
1. I'm worried my managers perception would change after they know I'm on a PIP, and they might become more critical. I do have a decent relationship with them so far.
2. Not sure if PIP is just a way to fire people. I feel like the end result might be subjective where they might say there is improvement but not enough. 
3. Not sure if I'll have projects in my second month (August) of PIP as my staffing as of now is only 50% until end of August.

Boring Work and Crazy work enviroment,"SAP consulting work is hell.   
  
I work as a technical SAP consultant and have been in this field for 14 years. Sometimes I genuinely wonder how I’ve managed to stay in this environment for so long. Over the years, I’ve worked with multiple companies and customers, gaining a wide range of experiences.

One thing I’ve noticed is how strange the consulting landscape can be in the SAP space. Projects often take a long time to kick off, but once they do, the actual work can be surprisingly straightforward. At times, I find myself completing tasks within an hour but still being paid for a full 8-hour day. It feels odd, and it makes me question the structure of this work model.

Adding to the frustration is the policy some customers have — rotating external consultants every two years. It seems like a complete waste of investment and knowledge, especially when experienced consultants are replaced simply due to arbitrary timelines.

To make better use of my free time, I try to learn new technologies. However, working with SAP presents its sht challenges. Licensing restrictions make it hard to experiment independently, and trial versions often require Mega supercomputers. 32G RAM.  While SAP BTP trials are somewhat helpful, many services are limited or unavailable. Requesting access internally is another nightmare—bureaucracy and internal politics can be overwhelming. Additionally, SAP tools are heavily optimized for Windows, and the experience on Mac is poor. Frequent crashes with Eclipse and other tools just add to the frustration.

In large organizations, there are often hundreds of external consultants from different vendors, and unfortunately, these vendors frequently clash with each other. This results in delays and inefficiencies. Even small changes—like adding a new field to a process—can require multiple meetings and approvals, wasting valuable time and resources.

When legacy systems are replaced with newer technology, the transition is rarely smooth. The old teams often withhold knowledge, making the process more difficult than necessary. I suspect this resistance to change is one of the reasons why SAP has struggled to move from ECC to HANA Cloud. There’s often a lack of collaboration and too much internal politics, which only slows things down.

In one project, we even had teams from rival countries, and the hostility between them caused constant delays in testing and UAT feedback. 

In another instance, I joined a customer project with three other colleagues from my company. Unfortunately, they aligned themselves with the customer and left me isolated. Worse, I remained on the project but was never assigned any tasks. I had to chase people just to find work so I could fill out my timesheet.

Every customer seems to have a love-hate relationship with SAP—mostly hate. They’re paying a premium and constantly frustrated with the complexity and cost. The moment you join a new customer project, the manager often starts thinking about how to replace you. It makes you wonder—if that’s the mindset, why bring us in at all?  
  
Last one is the worst. I was asked to select a person in the interview process and to send the name to HR to proceed with the job offer. The reason: the manager liked this person,he wanted good looking person. result our team has suffered. Hell

After spending 14 years navigating this environment, I’ve had enough. I plan to retire in two years.

Is Six Sigma Still Worth It for Consultants? What I Wish I Knew Before Choosing My Certification,"Years back, I was trying to figure out how to strengthen my operations skill set and kept running into Six Sigma everywhere, but the deeper I looked the more confusing the certification world got.

Now that I’ve been through it, worked on projects and spoken with others across multiple industries, here’s what I wish I had fully understood early on, especially for anyone in consulting or operations roles:

1. **Not all programs are equal** Some providers offer 2–4 hour Green Belts that feel more like a quick online simulation, while others offer 50+ hour programs that go deep into DMAIC, case studies, and real-world application.
2. **Who teaches you still matters** A surprising number of providers don’t list who created the content, just a company logo selling certs. My rule now is, if I wouldn’t take a class from a mystery professor in college, I won’t do it for my career either.
3. **The “official accreditation” confusion** Unlike PMP or CPA, Six Sigma doesn’t have a governing body. Many ""globally accredited"" labels are just private organizations. For example, IASSC is owned by PeopleCert and based in Cyprus. Not bad, just not truly “official” like many assume.
4. **What employers/clients actually care about** Certs help open doors, but real-world ability to map processes, run root cause analysis, build control charts, and actually solve problems is what clients care about. A cert alone won’t carry you, skill application will.
5. **That’s also where I’ve seen Six Sigma actually help consultants stand out** Being able to confidently walk into a client’s business, analyze processes, identify inefficiencies, and back your recommendations with proven frameworks like DMAIC can bring huge value. When you can help a client cut waste, improve processes, and deliver bottom-line results, it’s a skillset that’s immediately recognized and sometimes the certification helps reinforce that expertise on paper.

For me personally, the real-world focus helped me more than just memorizing definitions.

Hope this helps someone avoid some of the confusion I dealt with early on.",ProcessGuy86,1l9qbp8,consulting,12-06-2025,16:06:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1l9qbp8/is_six_sigma_still_worth_it_for_consultants_what/

And what’s left? Good question. There won’t be enough jobs for all these people.

Problems with taking on my boss's business.,"**TL;DR:**  
I'm an American working in Europe, doing US tax prep for an old American attorney (83 years old) for the past 10 years.  We cater to American tax clients.  We have around 120 clients, pulling in about 250k gross.  Deductions are 40k for the office plus \~30k generously in expenses, not including employee expenses (myself, 50k).

American working in Europe has spent 10 years reviving and running a US tax prep business for an aging, disorganized attorney (83 years old) who’s increasingly dependent on him. The business now earns \~250k annually, with the employee doing 90% of the work while the attorney deals with debt and declining capabilities. A succession plan was in motion: transferring the lease and clients to a new business formed with a CPA partner, with the attorney receiving a consulting fee and stepping back.

Two weeks before the transfer, the attorney unexpectedly claimed \~45 clients (worth \~$100k), undermining the agreement and asserting he never formally agreed to the transition. He wants to keep preparing returns in the office, while offloading the office costs and using resources rent-free, for an undetermined period of time.

**Current dilemma:**  
Four options:

1. **Scrap the deal** – Continue current setup but with risks of instability and financial insecurity.
2. **Accommodate him** – Keep him in office, despite major legal, reputational, and logistical concerns.
3. **Finish year, then split** – Plan an exit strategy and poach clients, but risky and uncertain.
4. **Coerce a handover** – Get him to agree to let the new team handle all client work and invoice under his name, phasing him out — the ideal but possibly contentious route.

The user is seeking clarity on how to move forward in light of trust breakdown and legal gray areas.

**Background**

When I first came on from another firm that shared the office with my current employer, his business was in shambles.  He had some type of problem with his foot, which prevented him from coming into the office for 3 months.  I pin it down to his alcoholism.

The office I was working at couldn't keep me on and pawned me off to him so they could recall me when they needed.  Turns out, he and I got along quite well, and we went off on our own way.  He let me come and go as I please, as long as the work gets done.

Long story short, I entirely revamped his business and made it profitable again.  We moved to another office and I essentially became known to him as the man that does it all - IT work, admin work, accounting, correspondence, and the actual work, tax prep.

Over the years, he has slowed down considerably.  Statistically, I have done about 90% of the work over the past 5 years, in addition to running this office.

Our relationship worked well - he has the credibility of an attorney, and I am the workhorse.  He managed the heavy-hitting legal cases, where I would handle from A-Z the tax prep aspect of things, in addition to the administrative duties...and more (like cleaning up after him when he would get drunk and spray shit all over the bathroom).  In addition he has massive debts to pay off to the government for wrongful employment (over to 90k), in addition to credit card debt in the states (about $30k)

Our relationship is symbiotic.  He needs someone to execute the work - I need someone to provide credibility.  We are able to turn a solid profit, but all the money goes back to paying rent for apartment that is much too large for him, and his never-ending debt.  I've taken it upon myself to invoice clients out of my own business, so I don't need to depend on him for payment.  I am a 'consultant' to him and bill clients in my name, but this can still be viewed as a ""disguised employment"" which could get him in a lot of trouble.

A few years ago, we began to discuss a succession plan.  At his age, if something were to happen to him, the state would dissolve his business.  It would be smart to think of a plan before something were to happen to him.  He has repeatedly told me his only desire is that his clients are taken care of and have continuity with their tax needs.

I am not an attorney in this country.  That said, a sale or transfer of his business to me is not legal, although US tax preparation, the meat of the work, is not classified as specialized work to be carried out by an attorney.

But there are loopholes that allow his business to be transferred to me.

2 years ago, I consulted business attorneys that explained the transfer of his business is possible. They advised me on the steps how to make it happen.  My boss was informed of all of this, even receiving the 10-page consultation on the matter from the attorneys and discussing with multiple times with me.

Essentially, if the professional lease were to be transferred to me, I would become owner of the tangible (furniture, workstations, etc.) and intangible (clients) property.

With that, we began to create a plan.

The idea would be for me to take over the business with a partner and pay him a monthly consulting fee.  Although he would not legally be allowed to conduct business in the office, it was promised we would leave his part of the office untouched, so he could continue to contribute to various the American communities he actively participates in, along with continuing to conduct legal counsel and various cases that require an attorney that he could bill out.

From the previous firm I worked at, the CPA and I began to discuss the idea of partnering and taking on my current boss's clientele.  We approached him with the idea, and he was on board.

**Current problem**

We decided that as of July 1, the professional lease will be transferred to the business that my partner and I have established.

About 2 weeks ago, my boss arrived at the office, pulled out a scrappy folded piece of paper from his pocket with about 45 clients (worth about 100k), without much explanation.

I approached him and asked to clarify what this list is.  He explained it's a list of clients he hopes to prepare, file, and bill out of his own name after the transfer, in order to ""facilitate the transfer"" until the end of the year.

Not only is this a big hit on the provisional numbers we have calculated taking over the business, but if I can be honest, in addition to his other shortcomings - my boss is an organizational mess.  I've worked tirelessly to keep our files extremely organized.  My boss is prone to break binders, spill things on paperwork, shove papers into a plastic divider without order, often confusing client docs with another file.  Over the years, I have had to follow him around like he is a toddler, putting things back in their place after he touches them.

Essentially, his demands are to remain in the office for the remainder of the year to prepare and file the clients he has cherry-picked to net him 100k.

When reiterating the agreement we have discussed over the past 2 years, he rebukes with ""I never agreed to any of that"".

Proposing that we continue to take the full client list, preparing and filing the clients on his list and billing in his name, he is also in objection.  He again contests with, *""What makes you think I would give you the entire client list, leaving me with no way to make any money??""*

This obviously leads me to think that keeping him around for the rest of the year is not truly his plan.

From what I gather at this point, is he wants to unload the financial responsibility of running this office onto me, and continue to claim nearly half of the revenue, rent-free, using my tax expensive tax software, utilities and equipment - not just until the end of the year (which imo would be painful, but doable), but for the years to come.

At this point, I am unclear on where to move.

Option 1. Scrap the deal and continue to work as we do - He obviously doesn't have enough money to hang it up, and moving forward will essentially cut my salary in half.  The biggest problem here is there is no continuity.  If something were to happen to him, the state would take control and dissolve his business.  My business partner is fine continuing to work independently, but I risk losing her if this goes beyond the rest of the year (or next year).  Safest move to continue I have a guaranteed income, especially with a baby on the way.

Option 2.  Accommodate him.  I have so many problems with this.  Legal, financial, organizational, and professional, technological.  Simply put, I don't want him in the office.  Part of me thinks he wouldn't actually be able to follow through with the workload he has bestowed upon himself.  He also has a somewhat poor reputation that I don't want to be associated with as a new business.  Additionally, I have no confidence in him to complete the work in a timely manner, causing issues with the IRS for our clients.  I will be obligated to pick up the slack.  This means I will be preparing the returns he chose to keep for himself, along with creating and tracking invoices for these clients on his behalf.  Essentially running 2 business - one for which I am not actively being compenstated for.

Option 3.  Finish out the year with him, but in the meantime work on a plan with my partner to find space, and strategically poach his clientele.  Most clients work exclusively with me, but many of them are loyal to my boss.  It's 50/50 in terms of how many clients I would be able to take away from him.  I'm fearful of clients not following me.  I find this to be the riskiest move.

Option 4. Coerce him into letting us carry out the work and issue the invoices for the amount demanded in his name.  This would be the preferrable option.  It keeps him out of the office after this year, and the transition is as close to seamless as possible.

Managers' duty to sell at bigger firms?,"I've seen this mentioned here a few times that as you move to the manager role (or a flavour of thereof), you're getting involved in finding clients, projects and generally no longer just providing consulting services by being placed on an assignment by superior. I assume this only increases as you get promoted, and you do less of consulting work yourself. 

But how does that work in practice?

Say, one day, an associate wraps up a project, get commended and promoted to manager. Then they get a new project to work on  doing analysis/delivery. But being promoted to a manager (or above) it means they need to find prospective clients and contracts. How is that played out - do they have allocated time for some cold calling, emails, or looking for tenders, or... do they just work on their project and just chat up people in power like:
""I know we are implementing ABC, but I've noticed you could use an improvement to your platform XYZ! If you agree to conduct a feasibility assessment by the end of today I will offer you a preferential rate and throw in free merch too"" - type of thing?

I now feel like I’m a data scientist while trying to learn how to be. I still need to learn advanced SQL, machine learning (properly), statistics, cloud. 

This also makes me feel virtually unemployable in anything but consulting. 

The worst part is my team seem to think I have a load of experience. I have no idea why. 

How do I deal with this? ",Individual-Quote-271,1l94775,consulting,11-06-2025,21:06:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1l94775/i_constantly_feel_behind/
Career Advice] From Data-Driven Strategy to the “IT Guy” — How Do I Pivot Out of This Trap?,"I’m currently a management consultant, working mostly with data-heavy transformation projects — data governance, management, analytics, etc.

Started out at a Big 4 firm, thinking I’d solve business problems using data - financial performance, strategy, growth - ideally using tools like Python, dashboards, models. What actually happened: I got labeled as the “IT person” and ended up being staffed as everything from:
	•	Project manager
	•	BI developer
	•	Risk analyst
	•	Software developer
	•	Data engineer
	•	Network engineer
	•	Architect
	•	Product owner

Despite not having formal training in most of those roles, I did well - even got top performance ratings.

Still, it’s not the work I wanted to build my career around. I feel like I’m always solving IT problems, never business problems. 

I switched consulting firms hoping to “reset” the narrative - shift away from the pure engineering/IT path and towards more commercial, strategic work (growth strategy, CDD, scenario planning, etc). But right off the bat, I was staffed on a year-long data sourcing project, then a software development project after that.

I’ve made it clear several times that I’m not a developer - I know Python for analysis, but I’m not a proper engineer. Despite this, people keep referring to me as “the developer” or “the coder” and keep proposing me for engineering-heavy projects. It’s like once you’re labeled, you’re stuck.

The kicker: we have plenty of actual engineers - but apparently, no one else can “do what I do,” so I keep getting pulled back into the same kind of roles. Even after doing well on the occasional M&A or strategy project, I get rotated back to data/IT because “we need you there.”

Has anyone been in a similar situation and successfully made a shift?

How do you rebrand yourself internally and externally when everyone sees you as “the tech guy”?

Do I need to leave consulting entirely to make the pivot I want?

Any advice would be appreciated.

Seeking real advice from the lifers #2: How do you improve your like-ability: saying what is nice to hear vs actually saying what you feel,"This is a follow-up from my previous thread on this page in which I appreciate all the insights and comments. I’ve come to a realization that to truly get to my answer I will have to ask this second question.

Yes I get it, like-ability matters. I feel like one thing that is stopping me from getting liked is simply of how I always say what I feel. I’m a strong believer that absolute honesty is the best way to bring the best outcomes at work. Nevertheless, true meritocracy simply cannot exist at the workplace.

If I think something can be done better at work or some process just isn’t done good enough, I will always flag it to my bosses. However, I feel like I never get my points across. Maybe it’s because sometimes the things I say aren’t what my bosses want to hear and maybe that affects my like-ability. What do I do about it?

We are all working to the same goal but as soon as the other team does something it gets picked on (why/what/doesn’t make sense/needs to be approved 2 levels up)so we are making baby step progress but won’t achieve any major things. i know I shouldn’t care but I’m being stuck and need to ride it out.

The company’s huge, slow, and political. Hours are still very high. My team’s dominated by ex-Bain folks and most of them have not been the most inclusive. You are judged often. I haven’t really felt like I belong. I have less autonomy vs BCG team lead role. I die every morning going to work.

Mid-30s. Where does your career go from here?,"I’m interested to hear the perspective of late 30s and 40s professionals (either in consulting or who have exited somewhere else). I’m feeling a bit lost in my career right now sitting in my mid-30s. My current co is a bit toxic and I’m thinking of potential exits. 

When someone asks what I do, I struggle more than I should.

My career path has been: B4 (finance transformation), FAANG (finance analytics/business intelligence), and now F500 director. Technically, titled as a Director of Analytics.

I have a sense of imposter syndrome. I have the classic “know enough to be dangerous” when it comes to accounting, finance, data engineering, SWE, data viz, business intelligence, strategy. But I don’t have the in-depth experience as someone who grinded out a career in say…audit, or IB, or SWE, or MBB, or digital/marketing analytics. Or perhaps I’m selling myself short. I’ve always gotten good performance reviews and have won awards (e.g. “manager of the year”, blah blah). 

Consultants and ex-consultants - how did you figure out where to go as you entered your 30s/40s? Obviously there’s the traditional path to partner/principal. But if you leave consulting, what do you do? Maybe take a start-up or younger company that doesn’t pay as well, but is more interesting? Suck it up and grind it out in a corporate role with bureaucracy and red tape? Start your own gig?

Dealing with confidence issues?,"Not sure if anyone will have advice on this. But I've struggled quite a lot with confidence since I started in consulting. 

I joined a really amazing team about a year ago from a non consulting background. I came in at a level which was too high for me and completely bombed my first project. To an embarassing extent I just couldn't handle it. I had to call my manager and say I was really struggling and it was just not good. 

I got moved onto another project and I did a bit better on that. But generally my juniors who have been in consulting longer and are generally more experienced are better than me and just have more knowledge. Then the next project I did okay on. 

I got 'strong performance' in my end of year review. But how legit that is I'm not sure. I feel the official review is not the same as the actual way people think of you. 

It's really effecting me. I feel anxiety non stop. I'm afraid to speak up in meetings. I had a period where I worked from home and actively avoided the office because I was too embarrassed and anxious to go in. I feel all my colleagues are judging me and think I'm useless.

Going to the Office for Networking and Climbing the Ladder,"Current situation:
I grew up in a small town, studied here, and my friends, family, and my girlfriend all live here. I'm now in my late 20s and have been working in tech consulting(implementation of software for clients) as a Junior Consultant for about a year. My girlfriend also lives nearby and will continue studying here for another 2 to 2.5 years.

At the moment, I mostly work from home. This is mainly because the nearest office is about 2 to 2.5 hours away by car or train. Additionally, my department colleagues are spread out across the country. Even if I went into the office, I’d probably only meet one or two of them – if they happen to be there and aren’t also working remotely. On top of that, the people I work with on projects aren’t necessarily based at the same office either – some are located in other countries, and many also work fully remotely. Also, Client visits are rare - perhaps a few times a year (if at all)

Now, it can get quite lonely working from home all the time. That’s why I often ask myself whether moving closer to an office would be worth it – just to have the option to go in more frequently. It would definitely be a big step out of my comfort zone, especially since life in a big city (on my own – my girlfriend, as mentioned, still has 2 to 2.5 years of studying left and couldn’t move with me) is a very different experience.

On the other hand, I wonder if relocating closer to an office would really be “worth it”? Honestly, it’s not just about being around people – it’s also about building connections, potentially getting involved in more interesting projects, and maybe increasing the chances of a promotion. But then the question is: would I actually meet the relevant people in person – randomly at the coffee machine or wherever? What if they’re also mostly working from home when I am at the office? Then I’d still be working alone, just now in a big city - 2 to 2.5 hours away from my family and girlfriend.

I run a small consultancy that helps product teams pressure-test their project assumptions before they sink months of effort into delivery. My work is rooted in workshops and lightweight tools, so I’m not selling hours as much as a way of thinking.

Job change Before 1Year (India),"Guys, I have a stable job now after an MBA from Symbiosis Pune. (Joined in Jan 2025 to present) almost 6 months.

But the job required travel sometimes, and according to me, the package is less than my college average. I was thinking of changing, but my senior said, Wait at least 1 year; don't leave. Even 2-3+ experienced guys at Big Four are getting 10-11 LPA jobs in climate change roles.

And one more question: does pre-MBA experience matter that much? My old (recruitment consultant) experience doesn't align with my current role (sustainability management).

Should I remove my old experience? Or should I keep it?",Old-Bus8284,1l5fv67,consulting,07-06-2025,08:21:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1l5fv67/job_change_before_1year_india/
Older consultants: when did you do your best work?,"It's often stated that in high intellectual creative and analtyical roles, folks do their best work 10 to 20 years after starting their careers. However, the library of stored information and skills peaks at about 40 years into the career. A guy who has been doing auto body repair for 40 years will be better than one in his 20's: he's just had more experience to draw on. However, a physicist is unlikely to win a Nobel after the age of 45. 

  
For those who are older consultants, how have your career and your skillsets evolved? I'm 47 and have been consulting for 4 years; I still feel very young, thinking of new ways to think about problems, new ways to present information, new ways to add value. I was an engineer and business owner beforehand; consulting ties into my previous careers but it's certainly a distinctive skill set and I'm learning new skills, such as Python. 

The downside of my age is that I have very little patience for incompetence or politics. People who don't follow through with their tasks or who simply refuse to engage their brain are a constant source of frustrations, as I don't operate that way. Nor would my clients tolerate me cutting corners. 

Any advice for budding ""experienced"" folks such as myself? Would you say that a new career at middle age is a refreshing, invigorating experience?

Billing and invoicing granularity,"For those that consult, how do you invoice or keep track of hours? I'm looking at it from a software perspective (business side). Do you keep track everything you work/tasked on in a day? Do you aggregate it to services perform (""market opportunity assessment"" ""execution and delivery of phase 1""). Do you send invoices monthly? Curious how this works. Do you present invoices high-level 'Service' X hours for a period (like a month)? Or do you provide per day breakout like a lawyer that describes the services you've done? If you're billing 160 hours a month, I can see that detail might be much?",Born-Hall4496,1l53ptd,consulting,06-06-2025,21:16:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1l53ptd/billing_and_invoicing_granularity/
Budget earbuds that don't pick up surrounding noise for calls?,"Any recommendations on earbuds that do not pick up surrounding noise? Asking this here instead of audio sub cos you guys probably have the similar use case.  
  
I often pick up calls on my desk at the office and people say they hear lots of noise from me probably because some people around me talk quite loud or I tend to talk soft comparatively. I do get into phone booth when I can find open ones but not always available, so I'm thinking to get new earbuds.  
But I'm also stingy af and don't wanna pay a lot from my wallet for work stuff. I also prefer earbuds to carry them around over bulky headsets.  
  
So in short, iso any recommendations for the earbuds that are;  
- not picking up surrounding noise much (esp. other people's voice)  
- reasonably priced (say below £50/$65)  
- earbuds or something compact than bulky headsets    
  
Before anyone suggests, I'd rather avoid secondhand AirPods. I don't know if it's just because of my colleagues but those using AirPods sound quite bad.

Rude client behavior trending?,"I’ve been an IT management consultant for 30 years so I’ve seen all types of clients - all the different social styles, some pleasant to work with some unpleasant to work with, some with partnering mindset, some with closed mindset - you name it.  To be in the business this long I’ve developed a thick skin and most negative statements I can deflect or diffuse.  However, lately I’ve seen some clients just be outright rude and abusive to some of my team members.  Yesterday, for example, one of my clients was bullied my team member and told her that our company was trash.  This is not based on any negative event or bad delivery.   This was just unwarranted rude behavior during a business conversation.  I was not in the room so I couldn’t help real-time.  Like me, she’s been in the business a long time and has “the client has always right” hat on, so she kept her composure in the conversation. 

Just one example of many.  It feels like I’m seeing more clients behaving this way lately.  Are others seeing this trend as well or is it just me?",EnvironmentalGur4444,1l517ie,consulting,06-06-2025,19:29:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1l517ie/rude_client_behavior_trending/
Laid off from Booz Allen 10 months after getting hired,"this was my first job after graduation and it’s really frustrating that I’ve already been laid off. 

I was a full stack developer for Booz, but technically, I was a consultant for the firm. I had no clearance, and I was only Consultant level, when most of the projects were for Senior Consultants. I basically did nothing for these 10 months except for one month when I was put on a investment project where I did some work and then they lost funding so I was back on the bench. I networked, went to events, and tried to put myself out there as much as I could, but since I had no clearance and since DOGE fired everyone in the government, there was just no projects for me to get on at my experience level. most projects required higher level clearance or higher level management inside the company. I also didn’t feel like relocating made sense since I was already located where the headquarters were and where most of the projects were and I had just moved to the city for the job so I didn’t want to relocate immediately again. 


I kind of knew it was coming, but it just really sucks to be at this point now. I don’t even really know where to begin with finding a new job since I got this one through a referral, and it was the only job that had been offered out of college related to my major. I’m just really frustrated and I felt like making a post to vent might spread awareness about how bleak everything is right now.

First-time consultant here (question about billing),"Hi!  I've been in talks with an ex-colleague of mine to provide research and insights consulting for her new job/company.  Basically they don't actually have any insights team in place so I would essentially help them create an insights function that can run without a full-time employee.

While I've done ad-hoc consulting calls as well as W2 contract work, this company would be my first real client.

As a first step they'll need my help in assessing new research vendors and their offerings. Since I'm not sure how many meetings I'll be taking, as well the hours for putting together evaluation checklists and reviewing legal paperwork to onboard new vendors, I've decided I'm going to charge them an hourly rate.  Since the result is a bit undefined, I figured an hourly rate was good to go.

That said, beyond that I'm proposing that if they require my ongoing support, including software training, creating one-sheets and narrative decks and any ad-hoc client requests, that they be put on a monthly retainer (say up to 20 hours a month).

I was also thinking of throwing out a ""fee per deliverable"" option.

They're a small company and I'm a first-time consultant, so trying to be as flexible as possible while also illustrating my value.  That said:

1. Thoughts my fee structure based on this info?
2. If we go each of these routes, I assume these would all be separate contracts?  Or can they all be outlined in one contract, provided I clearly outline each milestone (ex. vendor selected and onboarded, then moving to retainer billing).  I'll definitely looking to getting legal advice to help furnish these contracts, but just wondering how other consultants go about it.",Fickle_Track9630,1l4xqla,consulting,06-06-2025,17:07:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1l4xqla/firsttime_consultant_here_question_about_billing/
People love to hate consultants,"Got a couple of DMs yesterday of people who seem tired of the constant flow of -ve vibes about consulting.  Nothing new under the sun but here is my take:

Yes, large companies often spend copious amount of money to get a strategy house or a big4 put a stamp of approval on a decision that could have been made much more rapidly (but companies are organizations made of humans, politics, usually messy).

Yes, a number of times in their careers, consultants will feel overworked, overlooked, sometimes useless.   
  


BUT...

Done well, Consulting draws an amazing breed of talent,  smarts/agency/integrity (ok, I know, McKinsey, Enron, Purdue...).  If you join early in your career and if you're ready to take on the intensity, it will be a learning/career accelerator, whether you stay or go to industry.  



In my personal experience the amount of negativity is usually proportional to the level of frustration coming from people who tried consulting and didn't succeed or clients who see consultants (usually younger) getting better outcomes for their company than what they're able to drive.",Acceptable_Raccoon32,1l4xptb,consulting,06-06-2025,17:06:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1l4xptb/people_love_to_hate_consultants/

Feeling lost leading a consulting project solo. is this normal?,"Hi everyone. I really need to sanity check this with people in consulting or innovation.

I joined an innovation team 2 months ago. No background in consulting, no experience in the sector I’m working with, and this is the first time my org is delivering a consulting service to a client.

They told me I’d be “supporting” a senior on the project. What’s actually happened is: he gave me a rough outline, went on vacation for a month, and told me to take ownership so that when he’s back, “it better not be a mess.” His idea of guidance is a few voice notes saying “just do interviews, benchmark, and then roadmap.”

So yeah, I’ve been doing everything myself. Research, analysis, writing the diagnostic, client presentations, designing surveys, interpreting workshops, managing timelines… all while also carrying 3 other projects. No team, no framework, no real feedback... just expectations.

When I do get feedback, it’s usually “this is not good enough,” “it doesn’t read well,” “why didn’t you do XYZ?” Never mind that I’ve been figuring out everything alone from scratch.

I’m exhausted. I want to do things well, and I’m actually learning a lot, but this feels... off?

Is this what early consulting looks like?
Is it supposed to feel this unsupported and chaotic?
Or am I being set up to fail?

"New consultant (after 10 years in corporate) — just landed a major client, looking for early-stage advice","Hi everyone — after a decade in sales, operations, and tech strategy roles (mostly in fintech), I recently made the leap into independent consulting. I didn’t plan for it, but after being laid off earlier this year, I decided to try consulting — and I just signed an 18-month contract with a major enterprise client.

It’s been a whirlwind, and while I’m deeply grateful, I’m also realizing how much I don’t know about running a consulting practice.

Right now I’m:
	•	Delivering strategy + systems work for this client
	•	Defining what kinds of services I want to offer more of
	•	Figuring out how to formalize my business backend and attract future clients

I’d love to hear from others who’ve been doing this longer — especially:
	1.	What’s something you wish you had done differently in your first year of consulting?
	2.	What “small thing” made a big difference to your business success?
	3.	What tripped you up or set you back unexpectedly?

"Stalling out at Deloitte—Should I pivot with an MBA, certifications, or something else?","Hi all, I’m trying to figure out the next move in my career and could really use some advice.

For context:

I work at Deloitte and was transferred into the government practice last year. This also happened to be my promotion year, so I had to build a whole new network from scratch. This wasn’t a voluntary transfer—I was told to switch or risk being let go.
I’m currently a Senior Consultant, making $155K plus a bonus that’s usually 10-15%. While I’m still technically on track for promotion, I feel like I’ve stalled out. My skill set is very basic. A bigger concern for me long term is that the work I do is usually just an add-on to larger contracts, not the kind of work that drives the market. A lot of SMs have been leaving because the work we sell isn’t big enough to be a market maker.

I’m 31, and I don’t love the idea of taking two years off for an MBA, especially since I wouldn’t even be starting until next year. Plus, if I stayed at Deloitte, I’m pretty sure I would have to come back in at the Senior Consultant level post-MBA, which feels a little awkward. I’m also not sure how I’d frame it for references if I applied for business school, and I don’t know if I could realistically get support for our MBA sponsorship program.

Basically, I'd like to make more money, in a field with higher growth.

The FALSE Deadlines and deadline lack of honest communication rant...,"As someone who works the data/tech side of consulting and dont participate much in the client meetings. Usually the work comes to me either when data needs to be worked with and updated, just before a presentation because data output is needed, or the end of the report when things are starting to wrap up. 

Every single time I ask when the data updates or output is needed I get the standard non-answer ""right away""""asap"" ""priority"" with no definitive date. So I ask when their client meeting/presentation or report is due. They tell me a date that makes no sense and makes it seems like its a time crunch then. So I work on the data, pushing everything else to the side to get their data out on time before their possibly false deadline. Meanwhile these same people are doing other stuff, on vacation, or whatever. I work overtime to produce exactly what they want a few days before the actual false deadline they gave. But since they're busy doing other stuff, or on vacation I dont hear a response on feedback or changes they may need with the data I produce. A day before their false deadline and still nothing.....So that false deadline was in fact a fake deadline.  And if it was a real deadline, am I expected to work all day and night putting in a 16 hour day working through the night before the day of the deadline just so you can have it ready in the morning for the deadline? 

How does someone work around this lack of communication? I experience it constantly in my field on my side of things. I've tried to express my concerns and say ""okay but I am going to need more time to work on this"" or ""do you have an actual date? something like this could take more than 2 weeks to produce and if changes are needed, you can add several more days to that"".

Should I quit my management consulting job for a startup company based on these conditions?,"Hi everyone,

I have a couple of hard decisions to make. I’ve been working at a startup on the side for the last 8–9 months now and currently hold 10% equity. The rest is split between the two co-founders, and overall, we’ve made a solid team so far, though there have been some hiccups along the way.

In the last 4 months, both co-founders decided to go full-time (one is on paid garden leave, the other on paid leave but switching to unpaid soon), while I’ve continued working part-time—putting in 30–35+ hours a week—on top of my full-time management consulting job. That puts my total hours at around 80–90 per week. With the job market being so terrible for consulting/tech, I am worried, what would happen if we failed, one of the founders is on garden leave and will be paid for 2 years and the other is on leave but can return to his job, am worried if we fail I need to go back into this terrible job market.

Recently, there’s been talk of me going full-time to increase my output, but I’m having a hard time justifying the jump. The startup is fully bootstrapped, and I’d have to leave my only source of income while living in a high-cost-of-living city. On top of that, there have been discussions about reducing my equity if I stay at my job, or having to contribute more to the bootstrapping fund in order to keep it.

I’m really conflicted because I’m down to work hard and keep putting in the hours, but going full-time feels like a huge risk, especially considering I have significantly less equity and less financial runway than the other two.

Some background: our product’s been growing fast—we hit around 380K monthly users last month, which is a 10x jump from the month before. But ironically, we made less money due to higher server costs and a lack of monetization. We just started implementing ads, but haven’t seen a major revenue increase yet—currently sitting at around $2–3K/month. I think it will get better in the future, but this is the current state. Also, I am a new grad who has been working for about a year now, so I know that I can take more risks, but I don't want to fall off the deep end either.

"Burnt Out, Trapped, & Silent: Consulting as a Senior Manager Feels Unsustainable RN","**TL;DR:**

* 6 years in consulting, promoted to senior manager 6 months ago
* Reporting to a hot-and-cold MD who bullies the team
* AI is helpful, but it's driving unrealistic expectations
* Post-layoff fear, perfection pressure, and no room for error
* 8-hour round-trip commute to client (16 hrs total a week) on top of a 50/60+ hour work week
* Random, last-minute business development (BD) requests are chaotic and disruptive
* Feeling exhausted, not good enough, and emotionally drained
* Starting to apply to industry, but job market is slow
* Feel isolated—like no one’s talking about how hard this really is

I’ve been in consulting for six years and got promoted to senior manager about six months ago. It’s something I worked hard for and was proud to achieve—but now, I’m finding myself completely exhausted and unsure how much longer I can keep this up.

**Difficult Boss**: I report to an MD who is extremely hot and cold. Some days they’re disengaged, other days they micromanage and bully. I’ve heard similar things from others under them, so I know it’s not just me. But it creates a psychologically unsafe environment where you're constantly bracing for the next storm. Feedback is harsh, inconsistent, and leaves you feeling constantly on edge.

**Absurd Expectations**: I actually use AI and find it incredibly helpful for speeding up deliverables, getting unstuck, and staying sharp. But instead of making things more manageable, it feels like leadership has quietly adjusted expectations upward. We’re now expected to be even faster, more thorough, more perfect—with less time, less margin, and no acknowledgment of the human toll.

**Commute + Hours**: To make matters worse, I’ve been commuting to the client site. It’s an 8-hour round trip, and I’m expected to do that twice a week—16 hours of travel on top of a 50+ hour work week. It’s physically and mentally draining, and I’ve noticed that I’m becoming more irritable, forgetful, and emotionally worn down. I also am missing out of life events with family and friends.

**Business Development Chaos**: One of the most destabilizing parts of the job right now is the constant influx of last-minute business development (BD) requests. They come out of nowhere, often with 24–48 hour turnarounds, and they derail everything. We’re expected to drop client work or pile BD tasks on top of it—no additional hours, no adjustment of workload. It throws everything into a frenzy, and it’s hard to plan or stay focused when your day can be hijacked at any moment.

**Post-Layoff Fear**: The recent layoffs at my firm have created a lingering sense of fear. I feel like I have to be ""on"" all the time, because one slip-up could make me next. There’s no space to be tired, overwhelmed, or even *human.* It’s constant output, constant worry, and no real psychological safety.

**Mental and Emotional Toll**: I feel like I’m beating myself up every day. I keep telling myself I *should* be able to handle this. That others seem to be doing fine. But inside, I feel like I’m falling apart. I feel incapable, not good enough, and honestly just *exhausted.* Not tired—truly depleted. Like I'm stuck in a high-pressure system with no exit ramp.

**Trying to Make a Change**: I’ve started applying to industry roles, but I know it could take time to land something solid given the current job market. I’m not expecting a perfect solution, but I need something more sustainable than what I’m in now.

**Feeling Alone in It**: What makes this even harder is that I don’t feel like I can talk to my peers about this. Consulting is such a competitive environment, and everyone’s working so hard to project confidence that it feels like no one’s being real. I don’t know who’s struggling and who’s silently drowning like I am. I feel isolated, alone, and like I’m carrying something I can’t put down.

**Just wondering if anyone else out there feels the same. And if you’ve been through this—what helped?**",Possible-Ship-4461,1l2qb2u,consulting,03-06-2025,23:07:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1l2qb2u/burnt_out_trapped_silent_consulting_as_a_senior/
Turning down promotion,"I work at a small, high-performing company that was recently acquired. There’ve been some senior-level cuts, and a few months ago the CEO told me he wants to fast-track my development.

I’m currently a project manager and love the role. But the next step is more of a client-facing, sales-heavy position—which doesn’t play to my strengths. I lack confidence in selling and don’t think I’d enjoy it.

Would it be a mistake to tell my boss I’m not interested in moving up? I worry it’ll seem unambitious or hurt my standing, but I also don’t want to be pushed into a role that’s not a good fit. In particular, I do some amount of the role at the moment as I work towards promotion and I am feeling burned out as a result.

ERP Consulting - really loveeeed my job but it's not sustainable,"ERP Consulting - really loved my job but it's not sustainable

Anyone else love their job but know it's completely unsustainable?

So I'm in ERP consulting and honestly, I love what I do. The work is interesting, my team is solid, bosses are reasonable, and I've got decent autonomy. Pay isn't amazing (I'm in Asia) but it's fair, plus we get some solid government subsidies that basically let us bank a whole month's salary sometimes. 

But here's the thing - I'm slowly burning out because I keep getting thrown into team lead roles on every project. Don't get me wrong, I can handle it, but when you're managing an aggressive multi-region e-invoicing rollout while juggling multiple project deadlines... it gets intense fast. (I'm juggling a few ERP systems, one of which is as large as Oracle.)

I genuinely enjoy the day-to-day work, but I can see the writing on the wall. This pace isn't sustainable long-term, and I'm starting to feel it.

Anyone else stuck in this weird spot where you actually like your job but know you can't keep doing it at this level forever?

**Background:** Big 4 external auditor for many years, moved into accounting then ERP consulting. CPA certified and currently doing an IT degree. Planning to get either a JD/actuarial science master's or tax master's soon.

I find it bewildering that there are so few options for low/no-fee ACH transfers.

I signed up for Melio last week, but they have been nothing but trouble. Their customer support is essentially nonexistent. The chat support promises to resolve an issue or send an email ""later today"", then doesn't follow through. Zero commitment from them thus far on any issue. It took days to get access to my account even after my bank account got verified, with no help from customer support. The client I'm testing this with can't get set his ""vendor account"" (required by Melio) set up to pay me, after I sent him the invoice. I don't see why invoice payers need to create an account at all. It could just be like ""paying as a guest"" on any retail website.

Has anyone here used Melio and found a better alternative? Any other suggestions? I'm fine with transaction fees being a few dollars, but most of the big players are around 3%, which I do not agree with for simple ACH.

Former client reached out - how do I play this out at my new firm? (Senior Consultant),"**Update: I checked my contract and the non-compete clause has expired.**   
  
Hi all. I am a Senior Con at a Big 4 firm who joined from another Big 4 firm about a year ago.

At the previous firm I had a longer project that went well, and the client just directly reached out to me (at the new firm) for a new project.

I was a bit surprised since I am quite junior and as my previous firm manages the relationship with that client very closely. Its a major client.

**Options:**  
**1)** I bring this opportunity to my new firm. I am not (at all) interested/available myself, but potentially we could convince the client to take another consultant.  
**2)** I say that I am not available to the client, and give a heads up to the Director at my previous firm, who I have a very close relationship with and consider to be a mentor.

I think the natural option is #1, but would assume they are not interested in taking another consultant, and its not exactly the work my department usually does. However, this is outside of the US and my compensation is very non-performance based, so me bringing in a sizeable client would realistically not give me more than a pat-on-the-back. And perhaps the opportunity would just move to another department or country group internally.

Looking for career advice…,"Hi all, 

Looking for some career advice. I’m currently at a tier 3 firm, which I joined out of school, working in higher education on financial projects. I’ve been working for roughly 6 months. I enjoy the consulting work enough, although thinking long-term, I don’t think I want to be in the higher education industry. My question is, should I simply start applying to other firms and trial a new industry? Should I wait to try and get a promotion and then look for a switch?( promotion would be within next 8 ish months). I’m finance oriented, I just don’t have much of an interest in higher ed. If you’re willing, please just let me hear your two cents, any general advice as well would be helpful. Just looking for some steering.

"Discharged from the military, accepted into hypsm/oxbridge looking for advice!","Hi!  
  
Too give some background I have a quite unique situation. I am a portugse, malaysian, british passport holder with an american gc who in order to gain pr in singapore joined national service. I have served in the military in infantry for 1 year as a  sergeant with 10 men under me. I have been recently discharged for medical reasons. I hold an offer from oxbridge to study economics in 2 years on a scholarship.   
  
I have been incredibly lucky enough to recieve an offer to work full time in a mm pe firm (5b aum) in singapore for the next 2 years from a very close personal mentor of mine whose company offered the scholarship, this would be either in the ops or deal team role with the choice up to me. He has also offered to help me get a job in a vc firm in malaysia/singapore.  
  
My short term goal is that after finishing my undergrad in the uk i want to do an mba in the us straight after. My long term goal is ideally do venture capital or create a tech startup. (However, I have 0 experience in cs) My main priorities are wlb (50-70 hrs a week) and a fast career progression. I do not care about total compensation at all, as I see it every role pays high enough already and there is little difference in lifestyle between 100k and 300k compensaton.  
  
Regarding potential career paths which one would be better suited and help more towards my goals? Should I do ib, vc analyst, pe ops or pe deal?  
  
My thoughts on the potential paths of each are listed down below. Please correct me if i'm making any assumptions or mistakes.  
  
1. first should i pick ib/vc/pe ops/pe deal

2. during my undergrad where should I try to intern at mbb/ib/vc/pe ops/pe deal in the uk?Nc

3. which one would help me get into a top tier mba program in the us the best?

4. during my mba should I try to recruit for mbb/faang pm/vc/pe op/pe deal for each of these what position would be recruited at?

My current plan and thought process for quickest career progression would be  
  
pe op -> undergrad (do three 3 month mbb internships) -> mba (do one 3 month mbb internships) -> mbb on fast track -> mbb manager after 1 year -> exit to faang pm/pe op/corp strat/search fund/startup (which one would be better for my goals?)

The alternative to this would interning at pe op instead of mbb, progressing in pe op and then eventually exiting to startup, founding my own or joining a portco.  
  
Or I could go the venture capital path and do that pre undergrad and do more internships there as well with the goal of eventually founding my own startup or just staying in vc.  
 

which of these options have the highest chance of success? Or are there other better paths?  
  
I know this is alot of information and I would really appreciate any advice.

How to talk about previous consulting experience in an interview without revealing the client?,"Hey everyone,
I'm preparing for a consulting job interview and could use some advice.

In the interview, I’ll need to talk about my previous consulting experience. The challenge is: I worked exclusively for one client throughout my time in consulting, and that client is very unique in their field—basically, anyone familiar with the industry will know who I’m referring to, even if I don’t say the name.

Of course, I know I shouldn’t disclose client names for confidentiality reasons. But it feels really awkward trying to describe the work without making it obvious who the client is. I end up saying clunky phrases like “a large, international organization known for global coordination in X” — and it feels both vague and oddly specific at the same time.

To give an example (not my real case): Imagine I was a consultant from New York who only worked with the UN. How could I talk about that experience without constantly saying “a unique intergovernmental organization headquartered in NYC focused on international policy”?

This is my first job interview since joining consulting, so I’m still learning how to handle these things professionally. Any tips on how to balance confidentiality with being clear and compelling in interviews?

AI will replace 10% of all white collar workers within 5 years - Anthropic,"Now I know that Dario's comments are self-serving, so have to be skeptical. But something about the Axios interview also smacks genuine. This could all very well be hype, but what if there is truth in it?

I have a specific question. **Have you seen any firm put out or in the process of putting out an AI that will replace a consultant? Not talking about productivity tools that consultants can use, I'm talking full on replacement.** Instead of hiring MBB, a client would subscribe to this new thing that will deliver what they need.

Guessing MBB themselves are working on something like this, is that true? Could be a silicon valley startup looking to disrupt.

I’m already done with this job,"Hey everyone, I recently joined one of the most prestigious consulting firms in the world — a place I had dreamed of working at for years (in one of the expert asset teams). Landing this job felt like a huge milestone, and I was thrilled to get staffed on a client in an industry I’m genuinely interested in.

But three months in, things have gone completely off the rails.

The hours are brutal. I regularly work past midnight, almost every single day. Most of my meals on working days — lunch and dinner — are “working meals,” eaten while staring at my laptop. Leadership has no boundaries: emails and pings come in at night, on weekends, even during holidays. Expectations are vague, direction is poor, and the leadership team frankly feels disconnected and, at times, incompetent.

To make things more complicated, I’m on an H1B visa and just won the lottery this year, so I don’t have much flexibility in terms of switching jobs or taking extended time off.

Right now, I’m exhausted and demoralized. I know this industry is known for being tough, but I wasn’t expecting it to be this unsustainable.

Transitioning from IC to Team Lead,"Hey folks, 

Tjis is mostly related to tech consulting  SAP tk be specific. I recently moved into a Team Lead role after years of working as an individual contributor. As an IC, I was used to owning a small set of tasks end-to-end, with full control over quality and timelines.

Now I’m leading a team of 4. Some team members need handholding, and solutions aren’t always up to the mark. On top of that, the volume of objects to oversee has grown, and I can’t be everywhere. It's starting to feel overwhelming—especially with management meetings and urgent asks constantly interrupting deep work.

I find myself torn between two approaches:

1. Delegate and Forget: Provide direction when asked, trust them to deliver unless there's an escalation.


2. Lead by Example: Stay actively involved, review everything, and guide their thinking closely.


I've been leaning toward Option 2, but it’s exhausting. I know the right balance is somewhere in between—just not sure how to get there.

If you've been through this, how do you manage oversight without burning out? How do you structure your team’s work and your own time to stay effective?

Blindsided by a Senior Manager Who Championed My Promotion- Until She Didn’t,"I’ve been feeling pretty over the politics lately and just need to vent. I was on an M&A project in the biotech space for about 6 months, working closely with a senior manager who had been my biggest advocate. She consistently gave me stellar feedback, went out of her way to support my promotion, and even spoke directly to my partner and counselor about my performance.

Then I got the flu.

I had to take two days off, and when I came back, everything changed. She started phasing me out of meetings, and not long after, I was randomly released from the project. When my counselor followed up with her regarding my promotion, she completely reversed her stance — saying I hadn’t delivered on key work and wasn’t available enough. It was totally out of left field and contradicted written and verbal feedback she’d given just a week earlier.

My counselor was confused — we both suspect something may have gone wrong with the client while I was out, but no one has shared anything directly with me. 

I get that consulting can be political, but this experience has me seriously questioning how long I want to stay in this field. I’ve always worked in good faith and delivered strong work, but moments like this make you feel incredibly disposable.",dundermifflin22,1kvm2lq,consulting,26-05-2025,04:57:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1kvm2lq/blindsided_by_a_senior_manager_who_championed_my/
I wrote this song after my worst MBB project,"Hey all — wanted to share something a little different.

This is a song I wrote after coming out of the worst project I had done while at MBB (links for [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7hLpw5mbdg) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/4OW6MOlqRJvd8CwcFiWV8c?si=24bed1cc916a4434) respectively)

**Some backstory about the song** (and very relevant lessons learned):

I was on one of those studies that just felt impossible. Every week got harder than the last. It was one of those weeks where I needed to meditate in the toilet as to not break down during meetings. At one point, I even hallucinated while falling asleep—I found myself literally transforming into an unchecked checklist. That same weekend,  I received a text from my mum asking me if I'd taken the bins out and I almost had a panic attack.

I thought to myself: ""How am I going to survive another month of this?""

And so I called my counsellor for some emergency help. He said ""Gosh this sounds awful, why don't you quit?"" to which I replied ""I can't quit! I'll let down my team, my manager, my client, my director..."" My counsellor paused me and said ""Ah well there's your problem: you've built up an identity all through your life that says you don't let people down."" My hear sank to my gut because I knew he was right.

He helped me with a little mantra ""Next time you feel the stress coming, ask yourself *'Have you given it your best?'* If the answer is '*Yes'*, then accept there's nothing else you can do and that you're about to let someone down. Say to yourself *'I've given it my best. I'm about to let this person down. And that's okay. It's okay to let people down in life. It's part of life.'*""

That mindset shift saved me. The rest of the project was still awful, but I was able to survive. I still wince when I think back to how much suffering I had to endure on that project. But it taught me such an invaluable lesson. It's one of those ""You can know something but then you can KNOW something"" moments.

I hope this resonates with some of you and helps you find some peace.

While I am working with a business as a trial, I need to develop a way to earn income. I was thinking to request pay per hour by request but some of these businesses don’t make much and don’t have complex systems so coming up with solutions is pretty simple.

Temporary Relocation vs. Weekly Travel,"I work for a boutique consulting firm out of the east coast. I've been offered the opportunity to lead a client engagement on the west coast. 

I've been given 2 options: temporarily relocate for 1-2 years, or travel weekly to the client site. 

What would you request as part of the relocation package? We own a home in our city and a relocation would require my partner to leave their job.

Why do weekly updates still feel this broken in small teams or is it just a me problem?,"I work in a small startup where most of us are deep into engineering/delivery work, so project tracking often takes a backseat. Every week it’s a scramble — one person updates a sheet or email, someone else pulls pieces from chat, and then someone (sometimes me) compiles that into a status email for review meetings.

Before sending out the final mail, i have to check with folks to confirm their items. This i usually start in the morning so that i can get all responses by eve, since you know, folks take their own sweet time to respond.

It seems only I find it a issue. I am actively trying to put things in google sheets so that there is some log somewhere, because i hate digging emails! But no-one in my team bothers with these things. Actually everyone is super busy with their own items and i can totally understand that, but its frustrating still!I’ve seen this happen before in bigger companies too — I remember one of my old managers who used to run weekly meetings with a live Google Sheet open. He’d literally update each line item during the meeting while asking us for inputs. It was organized, but still kind of intense and very manual. Not to mention, you have to wait for your turn for the whole meeting.

I tried looking into Notion and Trello, but thats again additional work from my side and nobody in my team seems to care about using it. So forget about Jira, its just too complex and  beyond what we can afford. And i think you need a dedicated person handling such things anyways.

So now I’m just wondering — is this normal?

If you're in a small team, a startup, or work across a few folks (freelancers/clients/remote team):

\- Do you still do status updates manually every week?

\- Has anything actually worked for you without becoming another full-time task?

\- Or is this just how it goes in small setups?

Would be great to hear how others deal with it — or if I’m just overthinking the whole thing. Want to hear similar stories of folks who have dealt with these things and survived.

CTO at a small consultancy — brought in $1M+ in deals through my network. Should I be getting a commission?,"Hey all,
I’m currently the CTO at a small consulting firm. My job is mostly technical leading the dev team, overseeing delivery, that kind of thing. But recently, I introduced a couple of people from my past (who are now in leadership roles at other companies) to our Head of Business Development.

Long story short, both turned into strong leads and we’re now close to signing contracts worth over $1M. I didn’t formally pitch or sell to them — just made the intros and helped build some trust early on.

Now I’m wondering: in this kind of situation, is it normal to get a referral bonus or some kind of commission? Or is this just considered “part of the job” when you’re in a leadership role?

Not trying to be greedy I just genuinely don’t know how this works in more corporate environments. Would love to hear how others have handled similar situations.

Thanks!

Strategies to Future-Proof an Energy-Focused Management Consulting Career Against Automation?,"Heya

I’m a management consultant working exclusively in the **energy & utilities space** (think decarbonization road-maps, grid-modernization strategy, project-finance modelling, the usual slide-deck wizardry). I’m increasingly seeing AI/ML, digital twins, and off-the-shelf analytics platforms eat the “busy-work” parts of my role—benchmarking studies, scenario modelling, even first-pass PowerPoint drafts.

I’m NOT panicking yet, but I do want to get ahead of the curve. A few questions for those who’ve wrestled with similar worries:

* **Which skill-sets have proven the hardest to automate in your practice?** (e.g., stakeholder politics, change-management, C-suite story-crafting, quantitative modelling depth, etc.)
* **How valuable is it to double down on technical creds**—Python for energy analytics, data-engineering certs, or even power-systems engineering—or is the higher ROI in pure strategy / advisory finesse?
* Have any of you **pivoted roles to stay relevant** (product ownership, software partnership management, in-house strategy at energy majors)? How did that play out?
* I keep hearing “become the one who *chooses* and *calibrates* the tools, not the one replaced by them.” **What does that look like in practice for an energy consultant?**
* Finally, any **books / courses / networks** you’d recommend for skilling-up fast—especially those tailored to energy-sector AI, digital-twin implementation, or advanced decarbonization economics?

Would love to hear war stories, cautionary tales, and concrete next steps. Happy to trade insights on UK energy-market quirks, Ofgem headaches, or anything else useful.

Thanks in advance, and good luck future-proofing! 🙏

Got hired for Data Science & AI but ended up doing Excel/PDF documentation—should I stay or leave?,"Hi everyone, I recently landed my first serious (corporate) job at a big consultancy firm. My background is in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, and during the hiring process, I was explicitly told multiple times that I would join the **""Data Science & AI""** team. That aligned perfectly with my career goal of becoming a data scientist or ML engineer, so I accepted despite some hesitation about consultancy work—I prefer backend roles (coding/models) rather than direct client interactions.

However, as soon as I started, they placed me in the **""Data Management & Business Intelligence""** team. In my first month, all I've done is create Excel spreadsheets, PDFs, and functional analyses for business features and services. Zero coding, zero ML models, zero software other than Excel, Word, or PDF tools.

I've spoken informally with colleagues from my team and other teams, and they've all confirmed that most projects involve dashboard creation (PowerBI), business analysis, and rarely any real data science or ML—just occasional GPT wrappers at best. I'm still within the probation period (3 months), so I'm hesitant to speak directly to my manager about wanting more technical projects.

Aside from not enjoying what I’m currently doing (and feeling unsure if I even have the right skillset for business analysis), everything else seems great: salary is competitive for my country (for a starting position), excellent location, supportive colleagues, generous remote-work policy, and overall good benefits. Still, every day I finish work thinking, **""I'm not coming back tomorrow—I hate this.""**

Since I can save most of my income, I'm working on certifications (Azure, Google, IBM, etc.) that might help my future prospects. I also plan on studying and doing side projects in data science/ML (thinking Kaggle-style), but my free time is limited (working 9–17 with a 2-hour daily commute, though luckily some remote-only days).

I'm familiar with Python, C++, MATLAB, and libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, but only academically (I have a Master's in Applied Math and a Bachelor in Math), so I lack ""production-ready"" coding experience and a big chunk of data engineering skills. I'm confident in ML/data science theory, much less in practical applications.

There's little room for networking since our clients are primarily public administrations—older demographics, outdated tech stacks, and minimal willingness to change. Usually, a perk of consultancy is getting hired by your client afterward, but I don't see that happening here.

Honestly, I'm unsure how long I'm willing to wait this out. At 27, I'm young enough to wanting to pursue something I genuinely like, but I also realize I'm not exactly early-career for the market (I had personal issues during university).

**Is there a realistic path to transition from a business analyst/consultancy role into a more technical backend position (data scientist, ML engineer, software dev)? Should I stick it out for now, or start job hunting again immediately?**

Ops Friction Points?,"Across my 15+ years in high-touch roles for professional services, I've noticed a persistent pattern across firms.

Most consulting, legal, and accounting firms spend 20-30% of their operational capacity on manual administrative coordination. Client reporting, compliance documentation, project status updates—all requiring data aggregation across multiple systems.

The tools exist to automate these workflows, but most firms lack the technical expertise to implement them effectively. The current wave of tools from big firms aren’t super helpful yet. 

Industry-wide statistics show the scope:
• 42% of accountants turned away work in 2023 due to staff shortages (CPA Trendlines)
• 30% of government contractors spend 40+ hours monthly on compliance tasks (Deltek)
• Professional services productivity has plateaued despite massive software investments

I'm researching how AI agents could transform these operational workflows while maintaining the human oversight that professional services demands.

If you're in professional services leadership, I'd love to hear: What's your biggest operational friction point right now?

I Helped Shape a DoD Policy Reform but My Company’s Leadership Is Upset. Do I Go Out on My Own?,"29M, Marine Corps vet. I work in federal logistics and relocation. I’ve been managing government services at a large relocation provider for the past few years. Something major happened recently, and I’m genuinely unsure how to move forward.

At the end of 2024, I wrote a phased reform plan to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) aimed at fixing the DoD’s PCS (Permanent Change of Station) program. I had the opportunity to brief the SecDef in-person shortly after he took office on the problems with the legacy and new systems. If you're familiar with the space, you know the rollout of the Global Household Goods Contract (GHC) has been problematic. I had firsthand visibility into the failures and relationships at the right level to offer a credible solution. So I took the initiative and submitted the plan about a month and a half ago.

Earlier this week, the Secretary of Defense issued a formal memo that mirrors the plan I submitted. Same priorities, same structure, essentially the same plan that I had provided to him and his team.

On finding out that I submitted the phase plan without his consultation, I was pulled into a call with my company's president. He was angry, accused me of undermining our relationship with the GHC prime, and questioned who I’d spoken to at OSD. It seems like the fact that I was right has made it worse. He said I’d overstepped and damaged our relationship with the GHC prime. He seemed more concerned about control and optics than the fact that my plan had been adopted.

For context, I didn’t do any of this to create conflict. I genuinely believed it was an opportunity to strengthen our reputation and positioning within DoD. I took a calculated risk, fully expecting it to benefit the company long-term.

Over the last couple of months, I have started my own SDVOSB federal consultancy. It is still in its infancy, but I want to focus on federal logistics strategy and reform support (not operational moving services). I’ve written a white paper under my company name that outlines the original plan that I researched, developed, and created on my own and how it aligns with the SecDef memo, and where support is still needed.

But I haven’t released it yet. I’m hesitant, mainly because I’m still a W-2 employee and I don’t want to damage my credibility at my company, with the connections I have at the DoD or future relationships which I would need to rely heavily on if I do decide to go full time with my own business.

Right now, I feel stuck between a few options:

* Stay where I am and try to keep improving things from the inside, though it feels like I’ve hit a ceiling and internal politics are getting worse.
* Go directly to the CEO, share the full picture, and ask to formally lead our federal strategy efforts. I am mainly worried about further fallout if it’s not well received.
* Transition to self-employment full-time and start operating independently, knowing I already have the credibility and insight, but no guaranteed revenue yet.
* Try a hybrid model, running my company alongside my W-2 role with transparency, though I worry about the ethical and optics risks of doing that without full company buy-in.

I’m not looking to burn bridges. I want to do this the right way. But it’s hard to keep contributing meaningfully when it feels like the more initiative I take, the more resistance I get and I am not even being compensated at the market rate for my experience and the legitimate impact I have made at the highest levels of the federal government.

Has anyone been in a similar position where you make a real impact, but leadership resents the way it happened? How did you navigate the politics vs. personal growth dynamic? And how would you approach this kind of transition?

Thanks in advance for your insight.",canoe_dude13,1ktikev,consulting,23-05-2025,12:40:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1ktikev/i_helped_shape_a_dod_policy_reform_but_my/
One month in consulting,"It’s been a month since I started my career as an operations consultant in North America. I used to resort to this community to understand the world better - strategy, decks, implementations, travel, war rooms, screwed up culture, irrational hours, extreme demands, etc. have been the aspects of the career I wanted to understand rather than give in to the hype. I thought sharing my experience might help someone who’s doing the same today. 

I started with a decades old firm specializing in operational consulting - Mining, O&G, Industrials, Energy & Utilities for their Canadian arm. In last four weeks since the start, I have been on the road for three weeks. The onboarding wasn’t swift and carefully crafted but the team has been very understanding and supportive and they make up for more than any training would have done. 

The general project timeline for my firm is longer - 6 months on an average. I joined the current project in its early second year and there’s a good chance that it will go long for another year, or more. A clear downside of working on such projects would be not getting exposed to a ton of industries, roles, and people. A clear upside is being an “expert” in the thing I am doing. I didn’t ask for it, but it’s okay for me. I’m unsure of my long-term goals right now, so my focus is just to keep my head down, eyes and ears open, and try to do give my best. 

So far, I haven’t used the excels and powerpoint decks as much to create than to just acquaint myself with what’s already been shared by the team. However, I see that changing with more responsibilities. I used to wonder where my certifications in SQL, PowerBI, etc. from non-accredited organizations such as Udemy are going to any useful. However, they surely have been. I tend to use AI platforms and google to help me guide through the platforms and keep my team in loop regarding my progress and my comfort level but hadn’t I had shared those certifications on my LinkedIn profile, there’s a good chance I wouldn’t have got the opportunity to work on them at work. The idea with those certifications was not to be fearful of these skills when I need a start and it’s doing just that. 

The work has been a mixed bag since the strategy part of the project is over and I am working on the implementation end. Even with upselling the idea, I don’t see myself working on strategy anytime soon. Yet, the work, people, and client are new and it’s exciting. The hours might sound erratic to most people familiar with the wfm or 9-5 culture but it’s pretty standard to the people in this line snd industry of work. Give or take, I am at the office/ site by 7-7:30am and stay there until 5:30pm. Consider no dedicated lunch hours and I have skipped my meals a few times already , at times because I had work to do, other times because I couldn’t cook (we cool for ourselves on site (no cafeteria, restaurants, uberEats options at the site), or tomes when I just needed to crash or hibernate because I felt exhausted. I remember a day when we started at 4am on site and worked until 8pm. There was a moment I felt like I was done for the day and checked my watch to find it was only about 8:30am. I must mention that these hours are to ensure that we get to keep the Fridays to ourselves. We are expected to be available when needed, work on the work as required, but you can call the Fridays to be relatively “off-days.” This set-up is exclusive to this project and the client has been extremely accommodating. I have been told not to expect the same with for projects. The idea is to ensure that all the team members, from across the states, ends of Canada, etc. have sufficient time to travel back their homes and recharge. 

One minor challenge has been navigating the expenses, points, receipts, corporate-personal cards, and whatever that comes into that world. This should only be an initial hiccup as I expect myself to get fluent with the process in a couple of cycles. 

It took me 15-18 months to land a job and I was unemployed for that period. Unfortunately, I am sure I am not the only one. It takes a day for things to change and you never know if it’s going to be today, or the next day.

A rant. Please tell me I’m not exaggerating.,"Context:

32M, manager, 10yrs exp. I run a small team. I was promoted to manager after 1yr at my current firm.

The team had been left in shambles by the previous manager, and when I was nominated, I got no form of hand-over (no idea about ongoing projects beyond mine, no idea about management/reporting processes, etc). He left taking with him the only other capable person, leaving me with 2 juniors who had barely been trained.

Bit by bit, I learned the ropes, and eventually rebuilt the team from (almost) scratch, found clients, pivoted the activity to more interesting (and lucrative) stuff. By the end of my 1st year, we had gone from a -100% margin (yes, you read that right) to break even. By the end of year 2, we had doubled revenues compared to when I had taken over, all while reaching all objectives (especially, exceeding revenue / consultant and generating positive cash flows for the year).
I was ecstatic.

When performance reviews came around, my new manager let me know that “yeah that’s great but you were not profitable. It’s not cash revenue that counts, it’s accounting reporting”. (Wtf?). Pointing to contracts that I had never heard about, that had been won by my predecessor who indicated huge contract values, but since these were never actually launched, they were registered one year later as an accounting loss.

So, after doubling revenues, reaching all objectives, and developing the business, my reward was being told that I would get a bonus of… 2k USD, for “commitment but poor results”. F that.

But I stayed on because I believed I was developing something interesting (won’t go into details here).

2025 starts:

We lose two huge contacts that were near certainties. I had to scramble to get contracts. Started accepting bullshit uninteresting stuff because we needed to reel in some money.

Then they reorganised everything, without consulting me. Although reorganised assumes something was “organised”, which is really not the case. Not a single process was (or still is) written down. My boss told me I should write the processes myself (but then wtf is his role?). I answer to 4 different people who don’t talk to each other. My objectives for 2025 were given to me IN MAY.

I am still managing the team, managing commercial development, leading outreach and conferences (pretty much the only thing I enjoy anymore), managing my own projects, supervising half a dozen others, and doing the reporting for the teams performance. But since our reporting methods changed again, admin stuff takes a good third of my time, and our margins have been crushed by higher overhead costs coming from corporate. The new directions I got are in contradiction with everything I have been developing so far, and everything that had been agreed upon with my superiors.

A month ago, this one specific, boring as fuck project I had been forced to take but then forgot about (because I get 70 emails and 5 emergencies a day), starts and I let the PM know that I will need such and such data to start working, and to let me know when they have it. I got no feedback and forgot about it because I had other fish to fry.

Last week, I get a ping on teams asking me about my deliverable, because the client is worried, and the presentation is next week. I don’t even see the message because I’m responding to a tender, writing another deliverable, taking care of interviewing candidates, fighting HR that is screwing over a team member, and preparing a business trip abroad. I see it yesterday, and say “yeah I’ll take care of it”, thinking I’ll just write down some BS that will do the job.

I have now been staring at my computer for hours, unable to understand or write a single fucking thing after a 12 hr day, and feel completely fed up.

How can I take care of it ? Is this burnout ? Should I just be honest and say I can’t do it in time ? It’s obviously meaningless work. I’m just feeling sick and tired of this shit but also don’t want to flush years of effort down the drain for this one missed thing, but don’t feel capable of doing it -not that it’s hard, but I just don’t have the energy, mental space, or motivation, and am dreading Monday.

Questions from the client perspective,"I wanted to share with you an experience I had about a year ago working with a consulting firm and some questions that have been hovering over my head for quite some time. Sorry because English is not my first language. 

So, a bit of background: I've never worked in consulting before. My first job was at what could be considered an end client in the banking sector. At the time of this story, I had about five years of experience and come from an IT background. I love technical job and software development and those where main responsabilities in my position.

My former employer hired a consulting firm to help me with a project that had grown quite a bit.  At first, a junior came and we worked together to get things done, like if he was part of the internal team.

Little by little, the consulting started bringing in more layers of managers, seniors, etc. Without me hardly noticing, they kept taking over more and more of the work I used to do. Until one morning I woke up and realized I had become a secretary. All I was doing was making calls, sending emails, finding contacts or documents that the consultants needed, and little else.

If I tried to get a bit more involved in the technical side to see what they were doing, how they were setting things up, or even tried to help by lending a hand (not with the purpose of criticizing, but always from humility and with good intentions), it seemed like they saw me as a rival and tried to leave me out. On some occasions they even became slightly unpleasant and condescending.

Through all this, my boss was very happy with my performance and saw me as an indispensable person in the project. When in reality, I wasn't performing any of the functions that theoretically corresponded to me, and he knew it perfectly well.

Logically, at some point I had to accept the fact that they were doing all of my former work and that I then had a bullshit job. It was very disheartening to think that if I didn't go to work, nobody would notice. I felt increasingly stuck and anxious. So in the end, I left the company. 

Over time, I've found out that some former colleagues who stayed there have gone through very similar situations. Now all the technical work and project management is done by the consulting firm and they're just glorified secretaries. In my new job I've been collaborating with other consulting firms and in general I always feel this wariness toward the client, as if details had to be hidden from them or they had to be left out all the time, and it frustrates me.

Anyway, this whole text is to ask you how you see this story from the other side, to help me see what I couldn't from my point of view.

**TL;DR**  Consulting firm was hired to help me with a project, gradually took over all my technical work until I became essentially a secretary doing admin tasks. When I tried to stay involved, they were condescending and treated me like a rival. Left the company out of frustration. 

Maybe I'm very naive, but I want to understand if this is normal consulting behavior and how to handle it better in the future. Is there a deliberate strategy to take over the work of internal people? Was what I experienced an exception? Do you see technical staff as rivals or as allies?

Not sure where else to post this, but I could really use some advice.

I’m dealing with a colleague who seems to be intentionally trying to get me in trouble. They’ve been nitpicking everything I do, reporting me for minor things (often out of context), and generally acting in a way that feels undermining and targeted. I don’t know why they’re doing this—I haven’t had any conflicts with them, and I’ve been focused on my own work. But I suspect they’re struggling in their role and might be looking for a scapegoat.

I’m starting to feel really anxious at work and second-guessing myself constantly. I don’t want to stoop to their level, but I also don’t want to be a doormat.

Has anyone dealt with this before? Should I start documenting things? Speak to a manager? I don’t want to come across as overly dramatic but this is starting to affect my performance and mental health.

Rate Advice - Leaving my work and being offered a role as a subcontractor,"Hi, I have been working as a full time employee with a consultant firm (""The Firm""). I have been there for 7 years and am very unsatisfied with the opportunities/responsibilities I have been given so have recently handed in my resignation and am going to start my own company.

I have a long term client (""The Client""). ""The Firm"" has had me working with ""The Client"" for 7 years, they have had a few projects with other consultants assisting me, but the other consultants have never stuck for ""The Client"". I believe that ""The Client"" wants me not ""The Firm"". ""The Firm"" wants to keep ""The Client"" as a client and market to them to do other things that what I have been doing for them. I see ""The Client"" as potential customer for me once my non-compete clause runs out.

When I handed in my resignation ""The Firm"" asked if I was willing to still subcontract for them and work through them for ""The Client"". ""The Firm"" doesn't want to look bad and like they can't support what their consultants have done after they leave, although they really can't.

I am willing do this, I am fairly unhappy with ""The Firm"" and would happily stick it to them, but it is never a good idea to make enemies in business and if I am starting up my own company it would be good to have a side project to provide a bit of safety.

What do you think would be a reasonable rate of commission for ""The Firm"" to put on top of my rate for ""The Client""? ""The Client"" currently pays $250 an hour for me and I do not want this to go up.

""The Firm"": would be negotiating engagements,  
invoicing and taking payment from ""The Client"",  
is the only way I can work with ""The Client"" because of non-compete clauses,

Joined a small boutique and struggling to find space - advice?,"TL;DR: moved from big4 to small boutique, put on long term client with associate, zero ramp up schedule, CEO expected me to be a lot more in charge by now (3 weeks in) but I struggle to carve my space with an overzealous associate. Work fully remote.  
  
So, I left a big4 at SM level (London office) and joined a small boutique (~20 ppl all included) specialised in a certain niche back in my home country (western EU). The brand is strong in that niche, the founder is a former McK global partner with an incredible network, and the pay is good.  
I joined as a EM with expectations to become the next AP (at the moment there are only the founder/CEO and one AP above me), although I have almost no experience in the niche (this was discussed extensively during the interview process).  
  
I've been started on an existing client with whom the company has been working for close to a year (multiple renewals) on a project that was essentialy run by an associate and the CEO. This associate knows the client and the project(s) extremely well and is a smart guy, and I'd be more than happy to sit back and absorbe knowledge from him.  
  
My problem is, I am really struggling to find space. In my previous company when a new manager was joining I would take on me the responsibility to organise their ramp up over a month during which they basically did not need to do anything but follow my lead and I would ensure they were in the best possible position to start leading their streams.  
  
Now I have been put on this project that was already working well, without any path or guidance. Basically I have been added to all the calls and the CEO told me to work with the associate. Now, it sounds stupid, but this guy is doing 90% of the work and I have to wait for him to tell me what we need to do because I simply don't know. Whenever the client emails about something, before I realise what they are talking about he has already replied. He schedules review meetings with the CEO about stuff I didn't even know existed.  
I'm not even sure he knows or understands I am supposed to be / become his boss, and I get zero help from the CEO - he just shows up on the calls, we discuss the deliverable or whatnot and he jumps, and I could stay silent the whole time with him barely acknowledging my presence.  
  
I have been around for close to 3 weeks now and I scheduled a feedback session with the CEO, but I already got word from the AP that they expected me to show more project leadership by now instead of being de facto managed by an associate like I was an intern of some sort and that I need to speed up. The last three EMs that they hired have been kicked out after six months (I reached out to them on linkedin and will have chats in the next few days) which makes me even more worried about a potentially hostile environment.  
  
To make things worse we work fully remote (bar client site visits which we did in my week 2 and I connected very well with the client) which makes it harder for me to find any space to ask stupid questions or just casually chat about the project out of sessions scheduled for a specific reason.  
  
I cannot overstate how dumb I feel in posting for advice on how to assert myself over a colleague that is 6-7 years my junior, but I have never been in a similar situation.  
For now I scheduled a session with him to run through everything done / ongoing on the project and to discuss the fact that my role is to take some weight off the CEO's shoulders, so from now on he should review everything with me before going to him (realistically it would be a lot less efficient to do this at least in the beginning), but I don't really want to come across as an asshole because he is a good guy and the company is really small.  
  
Any advice / similar situations? I was comfortable in my former role but to be honest I never had to carve space out of someone more junior than me.

Customer requested extra content for presentation - not in deliverables or contract - and we didn't have time to cover.  Advice on how to handle?,"For you seasoned consultants, I need some advice. I've been in corporate for over 20 years and only recently started consulting. 

Background: 

I contracted with a client who decided they only wanted to start with the first deliverable of my proposal:  a presentation to understand the industry.  I had clear deliverables in my proposal for the presentation, and we split it into two sessions. They had way more questions, which is great, but we didn't finish what we were supposed to the first session. For the 2nd session, they added in items that were not in my original deliverables, and I didn't even think about it when the request came. I communicated that it's a lot of content to cover, and I would have to reduce other parts of the ppt.  They asked me not to scale back other parts because they were important, and I hesitantly I agreed to add the additional items.  

Dilemma: Again, we didn't finish all the material but only 4 slides away from agreed deliverables in my signed contract.  At the end they asked for ALL the slides (including the extra items) so they can review themselves.  Is it fair for me to tell them that I can provide the slides and the content that was part of my proposal, but say that the other content was outside agreed deliverables so we need to discuss what would be fair for both parties (i.e. not just give them free information that wasn't planned to be in the presentation)?

How to rebuild positive momentum on a long-term project that’s losing steam?,"Hey everyone,

I’m a junior consultant at a strategy consultancy and started the job a few months ago. I got staffed on an unusual long-term project. We’re halfway through, with six months still to go and things are really losing steam. It started off strong. Interesting topic, motivated team, and the project was positioned as a major initiative within our firm. But lately, the vibe has totally shifted.

Our project lead seems constantly overwhelmed and dissatisfied, even though the client is happy and things are broadly on track. This has led to long hours, rising frustration, and a pretty negative mood across the team. At this point, it feels like we’re just reacting to client requests rather than actively steering the project. No energy, no ownership, just survival mode. I’m honestly not sure the team can sustain this pace and mindset much longer.

So from your experience: how do you rebuild positive momentum mid-project when morale is low but the timeline is far from over? And as the most junior person in the room, is there anything I can realistically do to help shift things without overstepping?

How to tell someone (whom I will never work with again) they are an asshole?,"I lead a technical team on a client engagement. My client hired his mate AA (a contractor) to project manage us. However AA worked for my company a few years ago, but left on a sour note.

He uses this as leverage to grow his team on the engagement. I have called out AA a couple of times for his unprofessionalism and false narratives, but he often bites back with childish remarks, and client lets him get away with it. It's highly toxic. 

Fortunately, our engagement is coming to an end. On my last day, I would like to tell AA that he is an asshole, and creates a very unpleasant work environment, and that I hope to never work with him ever again.

How do I go about saying that, and not giving him the opportunity to bite back? Would you do it over Teams or face to face?

SAP “clean core” modernization — anyone seen it work in practice,"Currently working in a corporate strategy/internal ops role at a Fortune 500. We’re trying to modernize a ton of internal tools that were built on SAP years ago (some ABAP, some Frankenstein VBA + Excel + Access combinations).

Leadership bought into the “clean core” idea from SAP and wants to move toward modularized architecture — but implementation has been rough. Every big consultancy we’ve brought in just pitches the same 18-month roadmap with a giant price tag.

Has anyone seen a *real-world* implementation of clean core or lean SAP modernization that didn’t drag on forever or require rewriting everything from scratch?

Our CIO’s office is evaluating alternatives. Curious if anyone’s worked with AI tools, or if there are other groups doing something actually different in this space.

How to reduce meeting burden with SI and consulting firms,"Hey all,

I have always worked on the vendor side (AI call center tech), along side folks from the big consulting firms - bringing us into their accounts and pitching together.  I have always found the speed of collaboration whether it is a pitch, solutioning, technical discovery, SOW creation, etc to feel noticeably slower than when working these things internally.  

I am not passing blame.  It stands to reason - different structures, working styles, workloads all contribute to this.  

I am curious how I can structure my team's comms different to streamline how we communicate with consulting firms.  Are there ways we can best set up a working relationship to promote a quicker back and forth?

How reasonable to expect current client to match potential new client offer?,"Hi everyone,  
Looking for some advice here.

I’m currently working remotely as a contractor SEO Manager for a client who pays me $36K/year. It’s a stable gig and I handle the full SEO strategy and execution for them.

Now, I’m likely receiving a new full-time contractor remote offer for £65K–£70K + bonus (roughly $85K–$90K). There’s also another potential part-time offer for €40K + uncapped bonuses.

I asked my current client if there’s flexibility for me to keep working with them part-time while taking on new opportunities. The answer was basically no. It’s either stay fully or move on. Because these clients are in the same ""niche""

Here’s my question:  
Would it be reasonable to ask them to match or get closer to the new offer if they want to keep me on full-time? Or alternatively, allow me to stay part-time and take on other work if they can’t increase pay?

I’ve been told there’s a possible promotion in the works but I doubt it would push the salary above $50K/year.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it  did you ask to match the offer or just move on? Is it reasonable to expect them to double what they are paying me?   
I've gotten really really good at what I do and in addition to these two offers, I have 2-3 other interviews lined up from similar clients.

Finally tendered. Here’s the rant.,"I finally did it. I tendered. I’m done. After 4 years in the team, I’ve had enough. It’s been building up for a while, but I stuck around hoping things would improve. Now I just need to get this off my chest.

I joined when it was a 5-man team. We were small, things were scrappy, but it felt like we were building something. Now it’s just under 30, not even counting the people who’ve come and gone along the way, or other divisions. So yeah, the business is growing, which is supposed to be a good thing. But the way it’s growing feels completely broken.

Hiring became less about building the right team and more about filling roles quickly. **Body = billable hours = good**. That’s the logic. Doesn’t matter if they know what they’re doing. Doesn’t matter if they’re set up for success. As long as someone’s staffed, we’re “delivering.”

And then it falls on me. As the PM, I’m supposed to maintain quality. But no one on the team has the experience. We’re in a fairly technical space and we use proprietary software that people can’t just pick up on the fly. So what ends up happening? People get staffed onto projects they’re not ready for and I spend nights and weekends reviewing work that’s completely off, or worse, rebuilding it last minute.

And look, I’ve done it. The all-nighters, the weekend crunches. I’ve taken it on because I believed in what we were building. I believed we could fix it. That maybe the next hire would be better, or the next process would stick. Last year I even ran training sessions on my own time. Tried to help people ramp up faster, get more confident. Management said “great initiative,” but it stopped there. No real support, no structure, no resources to keep it going. This year I stopped running them and no one bothered to pick it up.

Even the senior hires have a tough time. They come in from industry and they get put into PM roles right away because they are too expensive to be learning hands-on stuff. But without knowing how the tools and processes actually work, how can they give useful direction to analysts? How can they review the work properly? It just creates this awkward gap where the analysts are looking for guidance, the PM doesn’t have the technical understanding, and everything ends up back on my plate to check or fix. Honestly, not their fault either. They weren’t set up for success, just like everyone else.

Meanwhile, the analysts are completely demoralized. They’re lost, unmotivated, burned out. And I don’t blame them. They’re being thrown into messy projects with no structure, no support, and no one to guide them.

I've raised concerns about team capability and delivery quality. But instead of fixing the foundation, management wants me to focus on sales. I’ve got new revenue targets. I’m supposed to work on “developing new propositions.” Meanwhile, the team’s burning out, clients are frustrated, and projects are falling apart. No one seems to care. The last straw was stepping in to help on another PM’s project. Came in and found the client already complaining, the analysts totally unmotivated, and the whole thing in chaos. And I realized… this isn’t a one-off. This is what things have become.

To be fair, I know everyone’s trying. Competitors are offering lower fees, so we have to offer lower fees. Investors are demanding ROI, so we need to keep the growth trajectory up at all costs. More selling. More headcount. In my eyes, they’re not building anything sustainable. It’s just win work, deliver the bare minimum, and hope the client doesn’t sue. I'm sure leadership knows this. But they can’t or won’t change it. Name of the game is to hit bonus targets.

So I give up. I’ve tried what I could. I really used to believe in what we were doing. But now, I just want out of the mess. 

Thanks for reading. Just needed to let this one out.

TL;DR: It wasn’t the hours. It was the system. Team grew, quality dropped, management didn’t care. Spent years fixing messes. Now I’m out.",Fickle-Perspective62,1kpm6cn,consulting,18-05-2025,15:09:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1kpm6cn/finally_tendered_heres_the_rant/

Ending an engagement with a client (self-employed),"I was laid off from my full-time job in mid-December, and immediately had one of my clients reached out to me to see if I wanted to continue some freelance work for them (doing the exact same work I was doing). I said yes, got myself incorporated, and slowly started working for them. 

As time has gone on, I do not want to continue this work, even though the money is solid. It feels like I haven’t left my old job behind and I have landed another full time job that’s set to start in a couple of weeks. I would like to focus on that and let this go, as I don’t think I’d have the bandwidth for both. The problem is, there are issues with some of the work I was doing for them. Almost all of the issues stem from when I was employed at my last job and how I originally built things. The workflows are not great for scaling up, and this was mostly due to a lack of resources at my old company and I was just trying to get it up and running for them. So they have started to look into a few things over the last couple of months and ask some questions, and I know that certain portions of the work are not functioning properly (and some small parts have never worked). It would take a good amount of time to go through the processes and re-work them. And while I don’t think they’d have an issue paying me for it, I just don’t have any desire to put time and energy into doing that.

So I’m trying to determine the best course of action to end the engagement without things getting sour. I did not sign anything regarding a scope of work, only an NDA. Everything has been pretty loose as I’ve been working for them, just looking into things they bring up and making modifications or additions to the work as they’ve asked for it, and I send them an invoice at the end of the month with however many hours I’ve logged. If that information is relevant at all.

Is MBB going downhill? What’s going on,"Provocative title I know. I’ve been at MBB a couple of years now and it feels awfully weird at the moment. 

It is somehow hard to put it in words but it feels like there is “sand in the gears”. Another metaphor would be the situation in which parents are going through a toxic divorce (senior leadership) but constantly act like everything is going as great as ever in front of their kids (consultants). 

I feel like every project is completely overscoped, seniors are constantly nervous and clients as demanding as ever. Almost any proposal I’ve been involved in has been pitched with strong discounts, highlighting that the market is just super tough.

I know this sub is mostly v bullish on consulting/MBB and will hate me for being so negative, but I really feel like now even more so with AI the magic is completely gone. 

Just imagine being a strategy consultant in like 2003 and advising say a German company on a go to market or digital business model. You could always pull a rabbit out of your head or bring on some US partners with “well that’s how we have done it over there, here we have done it x amount of times, this is what we advise” and clients were happy. But now? The whole information asymmetry is completely gone, clients don’t eat out of consultants hands anymore and are super cautious/critical of everything. AI completely cooked us on top of that. On literally every critical page we build now we get flooded with comments that clearly nobody would ever brought up with pre AI (did we test this? Did we think about that? Have we factored in X in the model?).  

Even partners are using it all the time and not in a sense that would make us more productive but just in a sense of mindlessly copy pasting their chatgpt output with “we should also have a page ready on this - I just found this with 1mins of search”.

I’m seriously fed up with the industry. The deal
For me was always great learning, great brand, decent pay with much lower hours than finance. If I would be thrilled about working to 1-2 am consistently I would just be in M&A and also pocket the premium in pay.

Honestly I wish I would have become a lawyer, an RX banker or what not. Some occupations where there is a clear information asymmetry between client/advisor and repeatable projects that let me build on my previous experience in advising. In consulting, at least in these days, every project feels completely chaotic and the clients always have this underlying distrust a la “we know better than these guys”. It’s just that of course we have partners knowing specific industries but the actual projects are always about some super niche/special thing that nobody has any clue about.

The CEO knows me personally from several academic projects I worked on for him, he was rather impressed and really adamant on me joining the team, even went as far as to create a new position for me specifically. The salary is really high for my meagre experience and I have no idea how I got away with my salary expectations in the first place. How on Earth did he agree?? I truly am shameless.

The thing is — the consultancy is specialized in the field that I love and know a lot about, they're seeking to expand geographically, and by some miraculous coincidence I do have ideas for how to do that. But I'm, like, a fresh grad, and I feel bad because the CEO is a really nice guy, for some reason he trusts my word, and it looks like I'm scamming a greying man out of his money. I'm fairly confident in my skills and I'm not nearly insecure enough to forget that I do have a lot of insights about this specific field, but making me *solely* responsible for strategy in this company is like tasking a dog with carrying out a space expedition. Laika's been there, sure, but she died and she didn't pilot the ship either.

i'd be really grateful if some of you could share your own stories, or maybe give some advice. 
So far my ideas are as follows: suggest a list of responsibilities for myself during a 1-on-1 (competitor analysis deck by [date], client data sheet by [date], and full deck with suggestions by [date]), get a green light and then report; then, once we reach a consensus, work on implementation. Though, still, this is just me guessing what my job probably implies. I do not want to get scattered and take on the responsibilities of people who work with clients, but I want to bring some value ASAP because this salary is too good and I do not want to get kicked out in 3 months.

Got an offer from industry and debating the pros and cons to leaving,"Senior 3 here Capital Markets space. Been here since college (4.5 years), have been passively applying to jobs the last few months. In theory I'd be eligible for manager promotion this summer, but probably won't get it this cycle because:

* Current engagement (1.5 years in) was 16 hour days and prevented me from getting involved in internal work to the extent a potential Manager would need to be. Next engagement I'm tentatively supposed to start on sounds boring as hell
* Practice isn't selling a ton of work right now
* There is currently a backlog of S3s+ that are in front of me
* Overall vibe from leadership is that this year isn't my turn

Got a verbal offer today for a regulatory engagement associate role at a Tier 1 bank, where I'd work with the fixed income division on reg readiness, compliance testing. Initially interviewed for another similar role, which was a grueling process. 7+ interviews across 4 rounds. Unfortunately, they went in another direction and wanted someone with less experience who'd sit as an associate for 4-5 years. After the 7 interviews and rejection for the supervision role, they told me about the reg readiness role and had me meet with the MD who'd be my boss (who I already spoken with prior).

The reg readiness role I got the offer for isn't as flashy as the one I initially wanted but I'm definitely a good fit for it and got along really well with the guy who would be my direct manager as well as the rest of the team.

Pros

* Current comp is 131K, with a negligible bonus (was 1% last cycle lol). New job would be 145K base and 10% bonus range. I'd be eligible for a raise at year end and and full discretionary bonus in the new role. Let's call it 160-165K TC
* Would get out of the consulting world where it becomes more about selling work long term than actual work (not a fan of this)
* Would work with Fixed Income which is a space that interests me
* Once at the bank, I'd have my foot in the door and would be able to pivot to something a bit more front office in a few years if I excelled / wanted to
* I'd be eligible for VP in a year and a half

Cons

* Would leave before truly knowing if I'd make manager this cycle or mid year, and leaving as a Manager obviously would carry more clout than as a senior
* Would be in office 4-5 days a week (which isn't too bad of a change)
* Less flexibility with PTO as in consulting
* Overall uncertainty about transitioning to a new role, have never job switched so it seems daunting
* Structurally more time before making VP than it would be to make manager, by about a year - year and a half
* Role isn't the flashiest - however it's more front office facing than any of the projects I've been on",Away_Box_9196,1kmnad4,consulting,14-05-2025,18:54:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1kmnad4/got_an_offer_from_industry_and_debating_the_pros/

Where do Business Consulting Companies get clients??,"Okay, I'm trying to build my own business consulting company with the set of skills that I have, even though they aren't that much, but I know as time goes by stuff will make sense when I finally get some of the first few a clients and do my best on the given jobs.

my biggest question however is, as a startup where do I get clients to offer my services to, where do I go to connect with people physically apart from LinkedIn?

Creating my own firm,"Hey everyone,  
I’m a 21-year-old environmental science major, graduating in Spring 2026, and I’ve been seriously considering starting a small consulting business focused on **Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (ESAs)**.

Right now I work in chemical inventory for my university’s EH&S department, and I’ve previously worked in groundskeeping with chemical handling at a golf course. I’ve become really interested in due diligence work and the environmental side of real estate.

The plan is to start small—just me doing the inspections, research, and report writing—while subcontracting a qualified Environmental Professional (EP) to review and sign off until I meet the 5-year experience requirement. I understand Phase I’s can range a lot in complexity, so at first I’d really like to stick to **residential or smaller commercial properties** where things are more straightforward and manageable as I gain experience.

My long-term goal is to grow this into something sustainable, eventually sign my own reports, and build a firm that focuses on fast, professional, and affordable service—especially for investors or small developers who might not have access to big firms.

# I’d really appreciate any insight on:

* How you got your first few clients
* What red flags or challenges I should expect starting out
* Whether residential Phase I work is even worth targeting
* Anything you wish you knew when you started in this field

Thanks so much in advance for any advice or experiences you’re willing to share.

MD wants to meet me for Lunch after moving to client.,"Hi all,

Little bit unsure what to expect here: I recently left consulting for client side (big energy company). My old MD who I worked with on a major project a few years ago reached out wanting to introduce me to one of their acquaintances who is a CEO/founder of a small sized company operating in a loosely related sector. MD insisted the lunch is on them.  This MD sits 1 level below C-suite level at my old company.

I considered this MD a good mentor and really helped me when I started out. We have a good relationship and the MD even occasionally advised me on how to approach building my personal property portfolio etc. However, I don’t see what value I could possibly bring to the MD by this networking lunch (I’m only like 4 years into my career and don’t have any executive powers in my new role). 

My questions are:

1. what could the MD want from me?
2. should I prepare for this lunch?
3. Any tips on how to generally go about this. I’m not socially awkward but this is the first time someone this senior is reaching out to me.

Need advice on leaving a long-term client project without burning bridges,"I’m contracting through a 3rd-party vendor into a boutique consultancy. The project is good, team is good, I’m not running away from anything dramatic — but I’d really like to leave at the end of January and take about two months off.

Legally I can walk away, but I don’t want to nuke the relationship or look unreliable. I had surgery in October, recovered fine, but it made me rethink workload and I’d like a break in Feb–Mar.

What’s the most professional and believable way to exit gracefully?
How would you position the reason for leaving, and what’s the best narrative to avoid bad blood or suspicion?

Looking for scripts, tactics, and experience-based advice.

Sharing dashboards instead of spreadsheets,"Hi everyone, I've been looking for ways to make boring data look good and easy to read. I often have to present insights from large chunks of data (and I also use it for my own BI as a business owner).

One of the things I tried was creating dynamic dashboards instead of static spreadsheets in PDFs. I used simple designs, added small annotations and callouts and kept the charts super minimal. The results have been pretty great, we don't need a 1-hour meeting to go through the report anymore!

AI Clones for Consultants: Lessons from Ray Dalio and Tony Robbins,"Ray Dalio recently [shared](https://fortune.com/2025/10/22/ray-dalio-ai-clone-training-advice-investment-mentorship-politics-economy/) that he has created an AI clone of himself. His announcement post on Twitter gained a lot of attention. Tony Robbins has [one that's available](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/programs/tony-ai) for usage already and I have used it extensively to brainstorm business ideas.  
  
If you are wondering how to create one for yourself, read further. It’s not magic. It’s all about **how you structure and retrieve their knowledge**.

# 1. RAG is Everything

RAG = Retrieval + Generation.

* **Retrieval:** Finds the right chunk from docs, slides, videos, transcripts.
* **Generation:** Turns that chunk into a coherent, context-aware answer.

Even the best LLMs fail if retrieval is weak. Hallucinations and missing info usually start there.

# 2. Make Your Knowledge Base Work

* **Overlapping Chunks:** Break content into chunks with 5–10 sentence overlaps. Keeps context across sections.
* **Metadata Per Chunk:** Add tiny summaries + 2–3 keywords. Helps semantic search hit the right spot even if phrasing differs.
* **Structured Docs:** Convert PDFs/slides to Markdown (headings, lists, tables preserved). Fact retrieval becomes more reliable.
* **Describe Visuals:** Generate short text summaries for charts/tables/images. Makes visuals searchable.

# 3. Optimize Retrieval

* **Hybrid Search:** Combine keyword + vector search for best results.
* **Multi-Stage Re-Ranking:** Fast search first, re-ranker filters top hits for quality context.
* **Context Optimization:** Merge related sections, remove duplicates, discard contradictions. Fewer errors, faster responses.

# 4. Embedding Tips

* Bigger ≠ better. Lower-dimension embeddings (e.g., 512 vs 1536) can be faster, cheaper, and often just as accurate if trained well.

**Bottom Line:**

AI clones aren’t about flashy LLMs. They’re about **structuring, embedding, and retrieving knowledge efficiently**. Smart chunking, metadata, hybrid search, and context optimization make the difference between a generic chatbot and a convincing digital persona. If you want to go deeper on the RAG or embedding post, here is my post that i shared in r/RAG subreddit recently - [post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rag/comments/1p59v9t/we_cut_rag_latency_2_by_switching_embedding_model/) and [post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rag/comments/1pc0nsn/we_improved_our_rag_pipeline_massively_by_using/)

Curious: Have any consultants here tried building AI clones or knowledge assistants? What worked for you?

What skillsets do you really gain at the EM or PL level?,"Hi all,  
  
I joined consulting straight out of undergrad and I am now right below the EM or PL level. I am not planning to go for partner long term since I do not think that path is right for me. My eventual goal is entrepreneurship through acquisition. I have tried recruiting for PE but have not gotten much traction, so I am at a crossroads: stay in consulting longer or start looking into buying a business now.

Search funds are not really a thing where I am, so I am trying to understand whether it is worth spending another 1 to 2 years in consulting to build skills that would be useful for operating or acquiring a business. Beyond people management, what practical skillsets do you actually gain at the EM level? Does the step up feel meaningful enough to justify staying if consulting is not your end goal?

Would appreciate any honest perspectives from people who have gone through this transition. Thanks.",dajupopu,1pdv8z5,consulting,04-12-2025,09:58:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1pdv8z5/what_skillsets_do_you_really_gain_at_the_em_or_pl/
I need your help to make a transition from academia to consulting,"London based academic at a business school—Lecturer (Assistant Professor) specialised in consumer behaviour and emerging technology.

— Besides MBB, what are the other consultancy firms to target? Possible mid or small size as well 

— On average, how long does it take to land a job in consulting? Including gigs or sub-contractor jobs 

— Besides case interview, what else do I need to prepare for?

Is this what “poaching” looks like? Because I’m confused,"I’m a mid-career consultant currently staffed on a project for a big multilateral. While on a business trip with the client, they casually asked if I’d be interested in managing projects for their next phase. My firm is handling the current phase externally.

Since then, they’ve drafted a TOR tailored to me. A member even joked about them “fencing” me in. Right now the only delay is an internal sign off. 

My questions:
> Is this what “poaching” looks like?

> Is it normal for them to do this quietly before anything formal happens? Or the role gets posted?

> Should I actually start preparing mentally, or do nothing until there’s something in writing?

> And if this is poaching, how do I handle it without damaging my current consulting relationship?

🏆 What it takes to win at the 'independent consultant' thing:,"🏆 What it takes to win at the 'independent consultant' thing:

Can you keep your pipeline full?

That's it.

That's the game.

Of course you have to be able to deliver, with value and a unique offering but if you cannot keep your pipeline full then you're toast.

Maybe that's why I see around 50% of the 'independent consultants' in the circles I run in head back to full time industry work within 12mo or less.

It's MUCH harder to keep your pipeline full AND deliver client work simultaneously than most realize.

And if you do not have a VERY strong personal brand, with an excellent network backing you up, it's probably not going to work out too well for you, no matter HOW good you are at your craft.

And if you do not want to do cold outbound (I refuse to), it's even harder because you not only need a very well established personal brand but you also need a strong referral network: happy customers, technical & SI partners all ready and willing to recommend you in the scenarios where you're a fit.

So yeah, consulting might look glamorous at times but if you can't sell yourself consistently well in the marketplace (without being 'salesy'), forgeddaboudit!
