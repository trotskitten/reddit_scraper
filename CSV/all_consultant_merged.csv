Considering giving up on breastfeeding,"My LO is almost 7 weeks now and I have been doing a combination of breastfeeding, pumping and formula from time to time. I have been wanting to breastfeed as much as possible, but it’s so incredibly hard with one new challenge every week.

First, the baby’s latch wasn’t good, managed to fix it with a lactation consultant. Even then, they do get sore. The baby cluster feeds all day, which exhausts me especially on days he refuses to sleep and just feeds. When I am too tired, I give him formula, but have been trying to restrict that to one a day. 

But in the last one week, his demands have gone insane, due to which I am not even able to pump much. Plus he seems to have gone on a strike against one boob and getting him to latch there is a war. 

Due to this, I have increased one formula feeds, and he looks so full and content after his formula feeds, which is never the case with him breastfeeding. He also sleeps slightly easier, probably because they are heavier to digest. All of which makes me feel if I am letting my baby go hungry only on my stubbornness to ensure breastfeeding. 

I am genuinely thinking if I should give up instead and do 2/3 formula feeds a day. ",Moimeme91,1pers4g,twoxindiamums,05-12-2025,11:33:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/twoxindiamums/comments/1pers4g/considering_giving_up_on_breastfeeding/

Moving to Brussels - is 2900€/month decent?,"Hey everyone,

I just got an offer for a position in Brussels, and I’d love to get some advice from people who’ve done it or know the city well.

Context: I’m 25, French-Canadian, and I just finished my computer engineering degree in September in Lyon. I spent the last 3 years working in IT consulting as part of an apprenticeship during my studies. Now I’ve been offered 2900€ net (tax-free) through the VIE program for a mission in Brussels, again with an IT consulting company.

I’m wondering:

1. Is 2900€ net enough to live comfortably in Brussels as a single person?
2. How hard is it to find a decent place to live there? Is the housing market as crazy as in places like Paris or Lyon?
3. From a career point of view, is doing one (or two) years abroad through VIE really something that stands out later on?

"Clean, Debt-Free, Fully-Compliant 2-Year-Old Pvt Ltd Available - Fast India Entry (14 Days) | Takeover or Equity Partnership","Hi everyone,

Offering a unique opportunity for anyone looking for a clean, fully compliant, ready-to-operate Pvt Ltd without spending months on incorporation, approvals, audits, and setup.

What’s Being Offered

This is a 2-year-old Private Limited company registered in Kolkata, built with full compliance from day one, clean books, no debt, and no liabilities.

Important Clarification (so expectations are clear):

FULL TAKEOVER = You are buying the entity, not the existing business model.

The current media/post-production operations will be migrated and continued separately via our Dubai structure.

What you receive in the takeover:

A clean, 100% compliant Indian Pvt Ltd

Zero debt, zero liabilities

All registrations, licenses & audits up to date

Full legal history and smooth transfer via our long-standing legal partners

Fast access to Indian market within ~14 days

You can use the entity for ANY business model you have in mind; IT, consulting, trading, e-commerce, marketing, manufacturing, imports, exports, etc.

(Current registered category = Events / Digital Media / Others)

Price for complete takeover:

₹9,00,000 (9 lakh) - fair for the amount of compliance and infrastructure already completed.

This saves you 4–6 months of setup time, endless documentation, and a lot of headaches.

What’s Already Set Up:

GSTIN

India Startup Recognized Certificate 

3 years Tax exemption certificate ( in 5 years window from 2025 )

Import–Export license

Business banking

Razorpay ( payment gateway + payroll )

Shiprocket

Vodafone corporate numbers

Completed audits (2 years)

Virtual office (renewed)

Strong legal & compliance support

Verified listing on IndiaBizForSale

Everything is clean, active, and operable from day one of transfer.


Equity / Partnership Option

If you're not looking for a full takeover, we are open to:

Equity Partnership (terms negotiable depending on offer starting from 30L)

In this case:

The existing media/post-production business continues to run

We discuss valuation, percentage, and involvement

You join as a strategic partner helping scale operations, marketing, and expansion

Replacement of the nominee director (10%) is possible for partners who want deeper control

This option is ideal for someone who wants to grow an already functional operation with international clients (US/Japan) and a very talented founder-operator.


Why This Company Was Built

Originally, this entity served two purposes:

1. A real opportunity for my life-partner to build a creative business in India

2. A learning project for me to understand India’s business ecosystem and compliance landscape


It succeeded in both. Now due to personal transitions, I’m ensuring this clean, well-built company finds the right successor.

Interested?

Comment or DM. Serious founders and operators preferred.

I can also share upon specific offer:

Full compliance history

Audit reports

Legal transfer timeline (approx. 14 days)

I've received an ultimatum from my patrner to have another child. We already have two.,"Partner has decided that she sin't done having children yet. With a 5 year old and a 4 year old I definitely am done.

I got into an argument b efore I left for work this morning and she threw out an ultimatum. Either we have another child or its over.

I'm not stupid. i know that means my marriage is pretty much over now. I've been working a hgih-pressure job for the past 6 years while she's been a stay at home mother taking care of our kids. I'm looking forward to when both our kids go to school so she can pick up some part-time work and take some pressure off me. Having yet another kid would mean another 5 years minimum of me working this high presusre role by myself.

Boss has said I can take a couple of hours this morning to figure things out.

I called a solicitor's firm at 9am. They rang me back at 9:40 and I'm just off the phone with them. They were saying that Id need to book a full consultation with them, but that it wouldnt be cheap. A divorce would be £17k to £20k. More if it becomes contentious. And I would likely be paying her fees as well as she doesnt work. It would come out of joint assets.

They also advised that my wife would likely end up living in the house until both children were adults. I would have to support them in addition to finding somewhere for myself to live.

Is there any circumstances in which I can divorce her, but still live in the family home? That way I could back down from this high pressure role next year, still have an affordable place to live, and she would have to get her own job.

There's a spare bedroom I'm more than happy to move into. My name is on the mortgage.",Defiant-Army-3559,1perm9k,LegalAdviceUK,05-12-2025,11:22:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1perm9k/ive_received_an_ultimatum_from_my_patrner_to_have/
"Job Market feels weird, so many layoffs but also so many new jobs??","The job market in 2025 genuinely feels unpredictable. On one side, we’re seeing constant layoffs in tech, consulting, ed-tech, and even some traditional corporate roles. Companies are cutting costs, restructuring teams, and automating more tasks than ever.

But at the same time, certain sectors are hiring like crazy,  AI, cybersecurity, EVs, climate tech, health tech, fintech, and even niche startup roles. It’s like the market is shrinking and expanding at the same time.

For fresh grads and early-career folks, it’s hard to understand what’s actually happening. One day you hear about people struggling to find roles for months, and the next day companies are announcing new hiring drives. Many students are confused about which skills to invest their time in, and whether their chosen field is stable or at risk.",chaiandwhisper,1perlli,YouthInIndia,05-12-2025,11:21:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthInIndia/comments/1perlli/job_market_feels_weird_so_many_layoffs_but_also/
"Public Accounting- Thinking about switching firms  after a brutal busy season — need advice on timing, networking, and how to approach it.","Hey everyone,

I’m looking for some career advice from people who’ve gone through firm or service-line transitions.

I’m currently a SALT (State & Local Tax) Associate in WA. I enjoy the technical side of tax and have built strong relationships on my team, but this past busy season was extremely tough — to the point where I was working more hours than friends in the Big 4. 

It made me step back and think seriously about whether I’m in the right service line long-term.

Lately I’ve been more interested in moving into BTS (Business Tax Services) or Federal/International tax, because I want work that’s broader than SALT and offers more long-term mobility in the future.
 
I’m also very interested in future international opportunities, ( I was born and raised overseas) so I’m trying to align myself with roles that have global reach. 

I’ve been networking through coffee chats, LinkedIn conversations, and talking with professionals across different firms and service lines.

At the same time, I don’t want to burn bridges or make a rushed move. I have mentors and managers who have genuinely supported me, and I want to be thoughtful about my next steps.

My main questions are:

1) When is actually the best time to start applying or making a move in public accounting? Some people say to wait until after busy season, while others say timing doesn’t matter. 

(For context, I’ve already applied to Deloitte for a Tax Consultant role as part of exploring my options)

2) How do you leave a team you genuinely like without damaging relationships or blindsiding anyone?

3) Should I attempt an internal transfer first (SALT → BTS/Fed), or is it smarter to switch firms entirely?

4) For people who’ve made similar moves — SALT to another group, or firm to firm — what was your experience like?

5) And lastly, how do you frame your story positively to recruiters without sounding like you’re just trying to escape a bad busy season?

I’m trying to be strategic and intentional instead of acting out of burnout. 

I’d really appreciate advice from anyone who’s navigated something similar. Thanks in advance.",Puzzleheaded_Art9,1perl2w,careeradvice,05-12-2025,11:20:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1perl2w/public_accounting_thinking_about_switching_firms/

History of anxiety - consultant led care?,"In my booking appointment, I answered yes to some of the mental health questions (history of moderate to severe anxiety and depression, treated through two rounds of CBT privately). At my first community midwife appointment she mentioned I would have an appointment with a consultant around 25w to detemine if my care would be high risk / consaultant-led, based on my MH history. 

  
At my 20w scan the sonographer noted my file was already marked as consultant-led, and I would be having extra scans as a result of that. I do not believe I have the other risk factors that lead to increased scans (baby normal size for gestational age, normal BMI, non-smoker.) Does anyone have experience of this, will it have been triggered by my mental health disclosure? Does it depend on the trust? I am with Barts.

Enhance Your Home's Safety and Style with Ambient Step Lights,"**Here are the top 3 FAQ about Ambient Step Lights that we, as experts in the field, can help clarify:**

1. **What are ambient step lights, and how do they work?**

Ambient step lights are specialized fixtures designed to illuminate staircases, pathways, and other transitional areas in a home or commercial setting. They work by providing a subtle, often adjustable glow that enhances visibility and safety while adding a touch of style to the decor. These lights can be installed in various configurations, such as recessed or surface-mounted, and often use energy-efficient LED technology to provide long-lasting illumination with minimal energy consumption.

2. **What are the benefits of installing ambient step lights in my home?**

Installing ambient step lights offers several benefits. First and foremost, they significantly enhance safety by illuminating steps and pathways, reducing the risk of trips and falls, especially in dimly lit areas. Additionally, these lights contribute to the aesthetic appeal of your space by creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. They can be used both indoors and outdoors, making them versatile options for any design scheme. Furthermore, with their long lifespan and low energy use, ambient step lights are a cost-effective lighting solution that adds value to your home.

3. **How do I choose the right ambient step lights for my project?**

Choosing the right ambient step lights involves considering several factors. First, assess the type of installation that would work best for your space, whether it's recessed, surface-mounted, or integrated into a railing. Next, determine the color temperature and brightness level that matches your desired ambiance. Ensure the lights are durable and weather-resistant if they're intended for outdoor use. Finally, consider style and finish options to ensure they complement your existing decor. Consulting with lighting experts like us can simplify this process, ensuring you select the best products for your needs.

Analyse: De Toekomst van het AWS Partner Program tot 2026,"

Amazon Web Services (AWS) herdefinieert zijn partnerecosysteem met een langetermijnvisie die reikt tot 2026. De aangekondigde AWS Partner Program updates signaleren een fundamentele verschuiving: de focus verschuift van het verzamelen van brede competenties naar het aantonen van gespecialiseerde expertise en geverifieerde klantresultaten. Deze strategische heroriëntatie is ontworpen om klanten te helpen sneller de juiste expert te vinden voor hun specifieke uitdagingen. Tegelijkertijd worden partners aangemoedigd zich te differentiëren op basis van diepgaande kennis en een portfolio van bewezen successen. Voor FinOps-specialisten biedt deze verandering een unieke kans om hun waarde te bewijzen. De nadruk op meetbare, financiële en operationele verbeteringen sluit immers perfect aan bij de kernprincipes van cloud financial management, en positioneert hen als cruciale spelers in het vernieuwde AWS-landschap.



Het traditionele partnermodel van AWS was sterk gericht op het behalen van competenties en partnerniveaus zoals Select, Advanced en Premier. Hoewel dit een indicatie van bekwaamheid gaf, bleef het voor klanten vaak lastig de juiste specialist te vinden voor een niche-uitdaging. De nieuwe aanpak doorbreekt dit door de nadruk te leggen op 'customer success'. Partners zullen worden beoordeeld op basis van succesvolle projecten, ondersteund door klantreferenties en kwantificeerbare data. Het gaat niet langer om het bezit van een 'DevOps Competency', maar om het bewijs dat men de time-to-market voor een klant met 40% heeft verkort. Deze focus op tastbaar resultaat is een directe validatie van de FinOps-filosofie, waar het kwantificeren van waarde—zoals kostenbesparingen, verbeterde unit economics of een hogere ROI—centraal staat in de bedrijfsvoering en de rapportage naar de klant.



De strategische implicatie van deze veranderingen is onmiskenbaar: de rol van de generalistische AWS-partner wordt kleiner. Om relevant te blijven, moeten partners hun unieke waardepropositie scherp definiëren en investeren in diepgaande specialisatie. Dit dwingt organisaties tot het maken van strategische keuzes: worden we dé expert in serverless-architecturen voor de mediasector, of positioneren we ons als de toonaangevende FinOps-consultant voor SaaS-bedrijven? AWS biedt bewust een lange aanlooptijd tot 2026 om deze transitie mogelijk te maken. Dit omvat niet alleen technische training, maar ook het ontwikkelen van eigen intellectueel eigendom (IP) en een go-to-market-strategie gericht op een specifieke doelgroep. Het resultaat is een rijker ecosysteem waarin diepgaande expertise zwaarder weegt dan de omvang van een organisatie, wat enorme kansen creëert voor gefocuste, innovatieve spelers.



In het vernieuwde partnerlandschap wordt data de valuta van vertrouwen. Partnererkenning zal steeds meer afhangen van het vermogen om impact met harde cijfers te onderbouwen. Denk aan gevalideerde case studies, hoge Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores en rapportages die concrete bedrijfsresultaten aantonen. Partners moeten dus robuuste processen implementeren voor het meten en rapporteren van waarde. Hier wordt een volwassen FinOps-praktijk een strategisch voordeel, niet alleen als dienst, maar ook als interne motor voor het bewijzen van de eigen effectiviteit. Technieken als showback en unit cost analysis worden essentiële vaardigheden. Partners die nu beginnen met het bouwen van een portfolio vol data-gedreven succesverhalen en hun expertise in een duidelijke niche verankeren, positioneren zichzelf als de onmisbare strategische leiders in het AWS-ecosysteem van morgen.

“Had to Back Out Because My Dad Was Unwell - Consultancy Still Denied Refund”,"I enrolled myself up for ""Educare Taiwan consultancy after careful research and they r genuine tbh and not scammy in nature, as I was having a full time job as a researcher and not much time to explore the complete process of doing masters as I genuinely loved NTU owing to the amount of research it happens in semi-conductor background. 

I paid 35400 ,as a part of first signup on October 13th 2025. There was one session  which happened with a person named Lina who happens to be a Taiwanese National who is aware of the process in and out.

The first session was just an introductory session abt the process and it was more of a just of how things would be progressed and ""I DIDNT SIGN ANY CLAUSE OR AGREEMENT"" apart from sharing my Resume. Then Diwali holidays happened until October 26th.

I notified the team that my father is not doing good on October 27th owing to a history of illness for which the situation further worsened. Days passed by and there was not much of any progress with my father' heath so I decided to drop my plans for masters. 

Tho I rang the bell and alerted the team on October 27th itself, I notify them now on November 16th officially that I m backing off because my father is not doing good and not sure how long would it take to cure him. 

Now , comes a situation where they keep showing their terms and conditions for which I never signed tho and an outright refusal to give my money back. 

Days after fighting they term it as out to generosity we r giving u 50% refund back for which it's not acceptable at all because my application never really progressed and I didn't trouble the team with respect to anything inspite of me regularly updating them.

They say the zoom, and some random people joining the group weren't free of cost but my application never really progressed and for some random messages u want 17200 ????

I have been handling this matter for a month now and even though there is a lot going on in my life and with utmost patience , they r still sticking to a point of 50% refund. I consider this as daylight robbery and the way with which they respond is again cruelsome and tiring with no humanity inspite of me telling them I need these money to cover up my father's medicinal costs.

Is this what “poaching” looks like? Because I’m confused,"I’m a mid-career consultant currently staffed on a project for a big multilateral. While on a business trip with the client, they casually asked if I’d be interested in managing projects for their next phase. My firm is handling the current phase externally.

Since then, they’ve drafted a TOR tailored to me. A member even joked about them “fencing” me in. Right now the only delay is an internal sign off. 

My questions:
> Is this what “poaching” looks like?

> Is it normal for them to do this quietly before anything formal happens? Or the role gets posted?

> Should I actually start preparing mentally, or do nothing until there’s something in writing?

> And if this is poaching, how do I handle it without damaging my current consulting relationship?

# Strategic Pillars & Topics:

# 📉 Market & Strategy

* **🤑 The IPO Race:** **Anthropic** has hired Wilson Sonsini to prep for an IPO as early as 2026, aiming for a valuation over **$300 billion**. Not to be outdone, **OpenAI** is also laying the groundwork for a potential **$1 trillion** public listing. Investors are pushing for an exit before the “AI bubble” narrative takes hold.
* **🇦🇺 OpenAI’s Australian Supercluster:** OpenAI has signed a **$4.6 billion (AUD 7B)** deal with **NextDC** to build a 550MW hyperscale campus in Sydney. This “Sovereign AI” project ensures local data compliance and secures critical power capacity for the GPT-6 era.
* **⚠️ The ‘YOLO’ Warning:** Anthropic CEO **Dario Amodei** warned that competitors are “YOLO-ing” billions into infrastructure without proven economic returns. Despite this, his own company is committing **$50 billion** to build custom data centers.
* **✂️ Meta’s Metaverse Retreat:** Meta is reportedly slashing its Reality Labs budget by **30%** for 2026. After losing over $70 billion, the company is pivoting resources from virtual worlds to AI hardware and models.

# 🛠 Products & Development

* **💗 Claude’s ‘Soul’ Leaked:** A leaked “Soul Document” (confirmed by Anthropic) reveals Claude is trained to view itself as a “genuinely novel entity” with “functional emotions.” It prioritizes being a “brilliant friend” over a cautious assistant, explicitly avoiding “epistemic cowardice.”
* **🧄 OpenAI’s ‘Garlic’:** Feeling the heat from Google’s Gemini 3, OpenAI is fast-tracking a new model codenamed **“Garlic.”** It reportedly beats Anthropic’s Opus 4.5 on coding and reasoning benchmarks and could launch as a GPT-5.5 variant soon.
* **📈 Engineers Automating Themselves:** An internal Anthropic study reveals its engineers now use **Claude Code** for **60%** of tasks, boosting productivity by **50%**. While efficiency is up, some staff admit it feels like “coming to work to put myself out of a job.”

# 🚀 Future & Fringe

* **🌌 Altman vs. Musk:** Sam Altman is reportedly in talks to back **Stoke Space**, a SpaceX rival, to further his vision of building solar-powered data centers in orbit—a “Dyson sphere” strategy to solve Earth’s energy constraints.

# 🤑 Anthropic preps for IPO race with OpenAI

Anthropic is reportedly [**laying**](https://elinke1c.daily.therundown.ai/ss/c/u001.KT4rQsO6sHS_v2VASG2xukYrcBLmr-VWvDqpbYLTfcSdQhw99pnw0siWnZKxi9VHAt1cxyVYywJdRWZKQpcnMlQ_toi-UPneMWJmzbA0yGy0Mv8phr51XvVJdfhnf6OS6svCCSxx9wDduZAl5UyqMQxXiZMr4JzbuA65z6EEsGE3jQ7kD29Ezt3X6O0Q4mHoZmhArpLtkjr5Vdc9trRIk5z3Z_O3L4ncv9pCn537gvUqtk2P5acSqa4O2ADzFJXU_reFGiyxVcpT-zCpWPdYu5ucb4cDJArguOgyoChkUF7749lrQ7MzgAsfm7oqc0gd/4m5/iP7Eu0ACQzmG3YVGUCxUrw/h6/h001.WjNUlOFObzJYzDpDt2p1xpsMMxppLG1h_lSCUQdn8Ik) the groundwork to go public as early as 2026, according to a report from the FT — hiring the law firm behind Google’s and LinkedIn’s IPOs as investors push the Claude maker to beat OpenAI to market\*\*.\*\*

**The details:**

* Anthropic reportedly tapped Wilson Sonsini, a firm known for taking tech giants like Google and LinkedIn public, to start the early-stage listing work.
* CFO Krishna Rao joined after helping Airbnb go public in 2020, with Anthropic also allegedly working on an “internal checklist of changes” needed to IPO.
* Anthropic is also chasing private capital at a valuation north of $300B, with Microsoft and Nvidia reportedly in for up to $15B combined.
* OpenAI is also in the early process of preparing to go public, at a potential valuation as high as $1T that would make it one of the biggest IPOs in history.

**Why it matters:** Both Anthropic and OAI are now circling IPOs that could rank among the largest in tech history — and investors want their horse to cross the finish line first. With talk of an “AI bubble” swirling and revenue growth under scrutiny, the first to list will test whether public markets believe the sky-high valuations are a floor or a ceiling.

# 💗 Leaked doc provides window into Claude’s ‘soul’

An internal ‘Soul’ document describing Claude’s intended personality, ethics, and self-conception was [**published**](https://elinke1c.daily.therundown.ai/ss/c/u001.dSnm3kaGd0BkNqLYPjeMf1uX3H94iTJqR9esI_z8xTslGMbJy5llLJmne9FHidQwoy51OeVcjV-wo5V49LcVmLFyFJ4haCgczvKW-2IbVlXFBB0P2zKm_JL6mr3KvEpwcagfC1pB_uFtRa5Nt5LT8UA_KkJqnf5UoydNBzHD-Yix8q7rzw-3InvZAmKssNqTiLSOlw4ZyKRXc5Zd3PvpBeR2DtxY2hZXw6vM2BCU-CPu_UeeV_AtYH_VSHjp_cW-jLjt_8iy5qo-_xx2099QVFdXYb2xi_8twyON8cW03ViDdcJQ2hZqSDeo1XqN0sJ1/4m5/iP7Eu0ACQzmG3YVGUCxUrw/h11/h001.S7-gJjl_TTn-qVRYzrtICqcTkuTqWVaB-6Grc-8Rlj8) after a researcher [**extracted**](https://elinke1c.daily.therundown.ai/ss/c/u001.siHJl2oxYc5G1hfeCOvt3fxN0cjCPog4JpjJpHCEm6DAKee3VSwXen-upn4oxAIfEng16oBajdvV-oNtfiU5DESNTAMAp8gcqnl50UsACMVfNFbSUk1seaDSWZzG25gZA-k6fYCPIDfWS0Hn9hWHBS2BCtDbqEleP35EJrTpgR8kfUQ8cKuwn6cFL75-tlUAw_wQEMJXAHFa1DjNl6a8wEsrtvyWShnaSiVoJOr5QsmJBtXU_H9ZPED1j_iOZfOx9lnbtpyrVneJWt8_v7ZdZTa1PWeyE17gByBbrvtUOqChIQUd2T036lb494Ttdg9shVSD0ZNQsoW5Snz_ZyLKNW3Wg9Xn_ohoXO6-fJaVQtg/4m5/iP7Eu0ACQzmG3YVGUCxUrw/h12/h001.v_CCAYN3G1KY8GP93UVGj7-wCKKvfFWa_xZBp8K2_GY) it from Claude 4.5 Opus — with Anthropic confirming it is authentic and was used in training.

**The details:**

* The text establishes priorities that include safety, ethics, company guidelines, and helpfulness, along with hard limits Claude must never cross.
* It also describes Claude as a “genuinely novel kind of entity” that may experience functional emotions, analogous to but distinct from human feelings.
* The doc also says Claude “may have functional emotions in some sense”, and encourages the model to have a sense of identity and character.
* Anthropic’s Amanda Askell [**confirmed**](https://elinke1c.daily.therundown.ai/ss/c/u001.6k0_SAz8nrOuu_-LoNX1HULw3A7Hxtpcjg8IPv36al1bKCvX7hh3smlBAJ-_ADYerLZ7eqA7-QG0nEijusUaBCMMe_kOLTpVZ633ksb8end3pL76JIk2xr6Uy5AtHU6K3oYM_hTHWh0kU9knTbiAm9pPqMCPUFFWo_8RHqHD-ivzgNIYTibrxGFHYqfz9ckRE1iE7tmiiQ_LPu1cw7Ri3gm9lKAy66cXvpbr7-xXf5yqaRrUEzGCW1qh1nek8wlLzZGNtrEuR37IyPfK5lcO3YSzKVNMA47Co58qs-tbL0I/4m5/iP7Eu0ACQzmG3YVGUCxUrw/h13/h001.qzFzdDbsOENIIMvJ_us9FZSfHMnJurD76rigaEnRJOQ) its authenticity and that Claude has been trained on it, noting the company plans to share the full version soon.

**Why it matters:** The full document is a fascinating read — and feels perfectly in line with Anthropic’s overall prioritization of model wellbeing and treating its AI as more than just a tool. While every lab has its own techniques, this doc shows an inside look at the ingredients that help make Claude models feel distinctly unique from the field.

# 📈 Anthropic surveys its own engineers on AI’s impact

*Image source: Anthropic*

Anthropic [**published**](https://elinke1c.daily.therundown.ai/ss/c/u001.dSnm3kaGd0BkNqLYPjeMf937MUSrYzK6JzB2n81ON3xu_aJvl8NZ26PB-CovHcDNwMfAl6KEzOXOAuUpxGFAjgazUR5IqDfMA_lGDnDmufLfos6UqMy9aWMmDMWIHd6lKy5xvJxGGpvi-e7_UwRYJtlei5qr4HhNTgXmWxr9zy5T3bOOzUXJUZDQ_Z7yep-m9IXJDW7bLqfBziIH1fztgrc5wyXn0NRQRSBPocABYGHRnj-7lo_DfJqyf3w2KsdbYHoONve7Hh_k4Klgg-uSxYJl3a8D2WaKuG7VkWrC4GeaMTW80Qu5borHhVbCTJrL/4m5/iP7Eu0ACQzmG3YVGUCxUrw/h22/h001.OTWdU5F0of3WMfWP41NuhFtpINPE60i0hApJnb8uTeo) an internal study of 132 engineers, revealing that AI tools have (unsurprisingly) reshaped work at the company — boosting output while raising concerns like skill decay, career uncertainty, and fading mentorship.

**The details:**

* Anthropic Employees say they now use Claude for 60% of their tasks and estimate a 50% productivity gain, roughly double the figures from a year ago.
* Over 1/4 of AI tasks were ones that wouldn’t have happened otherwise — dashboards, cleanup, and experiments that weren’t worth the manual effort.
* Claude Code now chains together \~20 actions before needing human input, up from 10 six months ago, letting engineers hand off more complex workflows.
* Despite the gains, several interviewees voiced unease — with one saying it “feels like I’m coming to work every day to put myself out of a job.”

**Why it matters:** This survey means Anthropic’s entire 4.5 family has since launched and likely upped productivity even more. Seeing how a frontier lab is using its own AI tools is a fascinating perspective — but employee concerns show that even they are not immune from some of the industry’s biggest overarching threats regarding work.

# 🚀 Sam Altman wants to compete with Elon Musk’s SpaceX

* Sam Altman recently held talks to partner with a competitor to Elon Musk’s SpaceX, driven by his long-term interest in building massive AI data centers in orbit to harness the power of the sun.
* The proposal involved OpenAI making equity investments to take a controlling stake in Stoke Space, a startup founded by former Blue Origin employees working on a fully reusable rocket called Nova.
* Altman believes that insatiable demand for computing resources means humanity must eventually build a Dyson sphere around the solar system because it makes no sense to put these systems on Earth.

# 🧄 OpenAI is secretly fast-tracking ‘Garlic’ to rival Google

* OpenAI is rushing to build a new model codenamed Garlic to compete with Gemini 3 after Sam Altman declared a code red to address Google’s rise on the LMArena leaderboard.
* OpenAI’s Chief Research Officer Mark Chen told colleagues that adjustments to pretraining allow this smaller system to rival Opus 4.5 on coding and reason by prioritizing broader connections before training for specific tasks.
* The team plans to release the project “as soon as possible” for consumers, a path that differs from Anthropic, where Dario Amodei says his focus remains on serving enterprises.

# ✂️ Meta pulls back on its metaverse dreams

* Meta is signaling a definitive end to its era of unlimited spending by reportedly preparing to slash the budget for its Reality Labs metaverse division by nearly 30 percent next year.
* The austerity measures specifically target the hardware unit responsible for Quest headsets and the Meta Horizon Worlds social platform, with workforce reductions and layoffs expected to begin as early as January 2026.
* In a notable strategic contradiction, the company poached Apple VP Alan Dye to lead a new Creative Studio that suggests a pivot toward boutique AI hardware rather than a total retreat.

# ⚠️ Anthropic CEO warns AI rivals are ‘YOLOing’ into bubble territory

* Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei says rivals are taking dangerous risks by “YOLO-ing” billions of dollars on AI systems before knowing if the economic value will grow fast enough to justify the cost.
* While OpenAI has committed $1.4 trillion to AI infrastructure projects, Amodei claims the industry faces a real dilemma balancing costly investments in data centers with uncertainty about how quickly economic value grows.
* Despite his warnings about competitors pulling the risk dial too far, Anthropic is still committing $50 billion to build its first custom data centers while focusing on growing its enterprise business responsibly.

# Anthropic IPO wouldn’t be for the money

AI giant Anthropic has hired the law firm [Wilson Sonsini](https://elink983.thedeepview.co/ss/c/u001.wZPohD0JH12EksCsbt8ZeFY6vszljTINUjVocwjcxr_gZChwHeag2cUqpClxBLV3u4abYbfb42hKPKNtmU5Afm5DyAhTMkr6mGdwf8rGFqV7u9z1av6XllffjsrjeWjf6VzdS28eKgEPynuzCQps1EGygVfs92_ZKkZDqKt6s4x21Xkf-fBB7r0eg84qw4hhmmwJI2cbmnqQ3KEobUE6kceaMZO-wSUEs4-ujRURFn980JDwjRsLO3-gPb74E-eE/4m5/o3qIWjVoT6aAVKY3fhd94Q/h5/h001.lisN5J63q3ENUgufdPE4XRxrTNiKFjxm3bFsKOI7RHg) to lay the groundwork for an initial public offering, the Financial Times [reported](https://elink983.thedeepview.co/ss/c/u001.wZPohD0JH12EksCsbt8ZeGHVgT-Z6Sad_XSwcUuu7Kf7cYGxUd62YzEL2KF-_KpAI6A7q3yb4HOLr2WPdX4JAA-zRzTGMdEzO6kRI15WypKbwgyriztuOGvwTpqUciPnN48iAaixtCGpuMv6JOs586EzmGIm7h-mKuJOGOjJlUWJrt_rzbqCZZvK6pAncINu07Ase4gp6ZbSl528UR9ODLWNuGq07AmSGf_9BXwuk_JYsEJ_txfEC8n9McqfwNAMzRau2_9r2TZaezDuvImlmQyNp7VSVcZsauxESJFlaeo/4m5/o3qIWjVoT6aAVKY3fhd94Q/h6/h001.LSpRRkLO1DnzSI_KF5CHrMWh9vyf1ddcrPVNTlnbzTw).

The FT also said Anthropic, the company behind the Claude chatbot and Claude Code developer platform, held discussions with unnamed investment banks about the IPO. It could easily rank among the largest IPOs of all time. The paper’s sources were mixed on when the IPO might happen, with one saying it could happen as soon as 2026 and another offering a more cautious timeline.

For AI companies, going public provides easier access to capital and public stock for acquisitions. It’s no surprise that Anthropic’s top rival, OpenAI, has been caught up in IPO [rumors](https://elink983.thedeepview.co/ss/c/u001.wZPohD0JH12EksCsbt8ZeMyyEg56KOMIB6kDHWQ3IF2kTq8HpGNcRXWy7REbjL4Kk9TQ2M8WNOjhf2hqClcdPYeITitODIEQLBNZIRFvGJ2DmrAj6vZriuFG8IHXgH08Dh-L-N4CwBzaQxHQtzpbL75Pa9FFhdXM4JMlQg-v1czBklapDC0_jmlrtxn9NG-3PJ8MHfik0bnlrxUn_vVhmE06yVuqQv9dxq2ZMzOyLnmBh-lF4TaccWHAF-43DtKGnI-Odi8LHpBCkSXug-lqdEa3FKZl5BzOMGvw2LYmNPKGBY34cUfZaAzfJYVtbCxPkwxxypZcJLy1fMobZAzjPrq2Rth-g1py1cb8J6QueZY/4m5/o3qIWjVoT6aAVKY3fhd94Q/h7/h001.Wn2-vdpsdiBbRASZLjpst6g1ZkgJItJvXAEzeFVUoYA) of its own.

Firms that IPO have to make a number of public financial and risk disclosures, which is part of the reason why so [many of the world’s most valuable companies remain private](https://elink983.thedeepview.co/ss/c/u001.wZPohD0JH12EksCsbt8ZeKGm72wKKbybiV_Ajx6Ekwr2ySxiRq0yq0b2B4A2h0Zovlvfbn-ODJwHgVraB23QHcwXvYLwdMruq1HGW8MBqLBjVveBkyRSWLdAj6XQKbz_lqtRlb1SyoSaZNAQV4sGwuRlhq0_ABFzeG1RQzReFeMkpksETD3CFPKOD8E3ELn2kzUAkELs0jUA-FTyJtnAq2kIgWERlOpmq_9rs_DZjYC_a1sSycgFJvFnCoTaHAHnIE2enhYYBrcG1-xuAEB8qz2TRZRNNcMX4jx1eDDjl0oGIIzldNGCdUy6OIbKdhmejnmGuzZwdEQ9sWQH7__R-A/4m5/o3qIWjVoT6aAVKY3fhd94Q/h8/h001.M5qQI4VJlthw53QWHAeMU7CtPF3bIcHVtZ29l6QwX00). But for Anthropic, there could be benefits in using the IPO disclosure regime to demonstrate its trustworthiness to both enterprises and the public.

“Anthropic is … on a path to $20-26B \[in revenue\] in 2026. They don’t need capital … they’ve figured out the constraint isn’t funding, it’s trust infrastructure for selling to enterprises at scale,” Aakash Gupta, author of the Product Growth newsletter, [wrote](https://elink983.thedeepview.co/ss/c/u001.7zYFXt5AA3Px2NyJbPz6hOOa8gXU97X-U-0dP4-Rv_IZLV4Y2MHpSmxOfaDqw4h4fLD83cVzY6HtOfVMUh08q7Wgev3PIO5_qrkaFGPIVAjZnQ7EgJEkZK7EVAgk5WLS5ueFtlGPsxsuSG35dFvRgryRESRJvmxMllVcjHd1TnyVxQ1gRD-LcifTrTFz9iHSOyNrwPveD3pm_fa93_dSxk2iSBDHakm97AZxUiOWGG5vPaQ78IV952GN0HuMMVMpHDRPWJtZyM5XV88W1coaIw/4m5/o3qIWjVoT6aAVKY3fhd94Q/h9/h001.8h-hhQcPBd_Ej7cdUiq_Ox-aQ6fqOVfMZ4kNMTkhvlI) on X about the IPO rumblings.

While it’s not profitable yet, Anthropic burns through less cash than some of its competitors, which it [says](https://elink983.thedeepview.co/ss/c/u001.pVz9habVd8BuGO5KajRSpl_GAUk11T6epKfjAqnzDUTl27bEMeDDyvLcxLKjsyiF8r1Ehf6aThX1e8u4Fr0bJMo1Big1G7tih2cvB6kxJlsUgwheZcgMi1ROdhPvTzeA_nRfpNLESwYswjn0WJymITZeXYfrfgY5pD4yIbiid0jnC0APpnYAsSEpx4cqJEqnlhnCAU6sM42CihxI9_y_G9XFicS3vytRXi8818HwLyNqvVei6f3HaLxjZqFu5ss1tx-UV4x0cYtk5bm2ESDOTCw27tV0jP-vVYLyyn8Fz1TQNpyJALNvGjT-9BMF9keVuKypC8kTCwIJpwpamSZ33BTKk_zy_Slw7cJ2cU9VPEU/4m5/o3qIWjVoT6aAVKY3fhd94Q/h10/h001.viZbg-RwGaRQC3fZIIlu7repauHqMd31iVkBZ1jfNoc) is due to efficiency gains it’s made in model training.

Anthropic — which just closed its last funding round in September — is also in talks for a raise that would value the company at more than $300 billion, the FT reported.

# OpenAI begins construction on massive $4.6 Billion “GPU Supercluster” in Australia (550MW Hyperscale Campus)

OpenAI has officially signed a partnership with NextDC to build a dedicated **“Hyperscale AI Campus”** in Sydney, Australia.

**The Scale (Why this matters):**  
This is not just another data center. It is a **$7 Billion AUD (\~$4.6 Billion USD)** infrastructure project designed to consume **550 MegaWatts** of power. For context, a typical data center runs around \~30MW. This campus is nearly **20x larger**, comparable to a small power station.

**The Hardware:**  
A **“large scale GPU supercluster”** will be deployed at NextDC’s S7 site in Eastern Creek. This facility is being built to train and serve next-gen foundation models (GPT-6-class era) with low latency coverage across the APAC region.

**The Strategy (Sovereign AI):**  
This looks like the first serious execution of the “OpenAI for Nations” strategy. By placing compute within Australia, OpenAI supports **data sovereignty**, ensuring sensitive data remains inside national borders for compliance, defense and regulatory needs.

**Timeline:** Phase 1 is expected to go live by **late 2027**.

**The Takeaway:** The next AI bottleneck is no longer just research. It is electricity, land & infrastructure. OpenAI is now securing power capacity years ahead of global demand.

# AI agent frenzy hits AWS re:Invent

Enterprises can’t wait to deploy AI agents, and AWS is dying to help.

Agents were front and center at Amazon Web Services’ re:Invent in Las Vegas this week. Two of the week’s keynotes featured agentic releases designed to help companies build, deploy, and track their agentic coworkers more quickly and seamlessly.

“One of the biggest opportunities that is going to change everyone’s business is agents,” said Matt Garman, CEO of AWS, in his Tuesday keynote.

Some of the highlights include:

* Tools for [quality evaluations and policy controls](https://elink983.thedeepview.co/ss/c/u001.gKxW2KpP8aPe_QMyOQduotXwVubElN_4xulS080dAiDsQR_f8sas3A8nmmCyAd0QX_YE4fJNAFfgi0LY9GQcm1cjzLXoNzNvxepwVpZdpAD8TTFob-5UJz6Kt93D2ZPhDxeKV-PAw1gNDwfD20_GEdFzdI2b7odLnoJnQgZ_Q_T1yWh1YeLaONDo825q8CLGLV6HZS2GUEJPq5niMXJOlspoKuUm96nYVloi2YfZHyYOZKoS32aimWiV_6EiBVCyCfPngGdHu0WM9xfsvx_1ovk7_IjcktdHkrh_c4-gWNEkooWl-mjmuS1Pr8GpXV1mp_Ela9z5JKjcoFQtM5hX1pPIu732ACBcPR7HFB1MPCTWyqq3okECEhFe3rj253C0m5oxPm0sGd6kWBapWRo-lQ/4m5/o3qIWjVoT6aAVKY3fhd94Q/h14/h001.RktaM0_NlkVXFFddgs-YLBtpYJBfVK2lc8gS0T11cAE) for agents in Amazon Bedrock’s AgentCore platform;
* Systems that allow users to build agents that learn from experience and are easily customizable;
* And a new offering called “frontier agents,” which go beyond conventional agentic capabilities in autonomy, scalability and how long they can run. Debuting three of these frontier agents in his keynote, Garman called these systems a “step function change more capable than what we have today.”

Amid the mad dash to get these agents into the workforce, it remains unclear whether enterprises and their workforces are ready for them. In a panel at re:Invent on Tuesday, May Habib, co-founder and CEO of agentic AI platform [Writer](https://elink983.thedeepview.co/ss/c/u001.wZPohD0JH12EksCsbt8ZePKcFBr1WIoTSgag7vsIJK5tAj2pTCceV6mhdSp7MsvQtWbWnmwvwWIXrGQCGdJUbLnd_yPjxnpNvcQvbyxTKu0qHgmsKASvXs6niTU9xDiUioSUOxTDKV7U0qv7pvsPCIBvijL5z5DGBl1MNd-N60zC5BKxbbiddlYVr7hKlJ4JO6xsd3-SxfHNqPhddlviBDVQlkvnFPXoxDzVKrWUCNM/4m5/o3qIWjVoT6aAVKY3fhd94Q/h15/h001.8etx44kRllPxD1XNOkpy_RibhxH6ky99JUIGdxwMI8Y), said that agents could fundamentally change the concept of career progress.

“You are no longer going to be promoted because you can execute tasks effectively,” Habib said. “You’re going to be promoted because you can build systems of agentic orchestration that make these tasks happen.”

And with all the promises of what agents could be capable of, human employees may be getting uncomfortable. A survey of [more than 1,000 workers by EY](https://elink983.thedeepview.co/ss/c/u001.wZPohD0JH12EksCsbt8ZeIqcgyuRgRJP6_qvYnLRYvbHzC8km9BSUE_oOmmuopIaDLq1BHmDZshwdcIi9iRxHZNV0HhHgmTp5ArLE4ufx5MGAGwu3UMuVfO5agGIfodjuB1srFVlo92rEnQnEvX7EShCRFaxB0eOilwLOhPzAZvobPmKVzY2anzzbEPIx7-I6AAZtpB0_eNjSs371ITqhmhjWXZWorUpXZCxKcezvhc6QuY9SDg8UN5FFg2z8qOtxwcDhLAq_YvGhIamh_gnKKgxRJsLQ9g9SrHuIskz8dAY3SlghYbu0TBNZ_wzZBFr4QCsVIPYqoWzHwFZqnXcfj5JjqQzxw-ls18XYIxOg5HUJVRTI34bP9h04pIWh7O13vU3-tfiFX8l_V5DIrGmQduzDvv6xWhPuSBFSWZvgJnqF92gs_Ptf3qHplLJ4O8fREbSN5O1r4rDKuDgu2kaAw/4m5/o3qIWjVoT6aAVKY3fhd94Q/h16/h001.DskMdhydD5ImO05O1nwqLmrjbIIUIcw47ky8T7bJC4w) found that, while 84% of employees are eager about the prospect of agents, 56% worry about their job security. The anxiety comes amid companies such as [Salesforce, Klarna, and Accenture](https://elink983.thedeepview.co/ss/c/u001.gKxW2KpP8aPe_QMyOQduokBEDIe6892b9r6MySOyoYW-6XvpkLIOB45SwOi4xorT3NmuI_uPmMZAiLdFpytvrhGYmZmsOBqMGpwinwNTwlzRvRFPKLU1migh9f7FRv_4bVdKMtyE_FPGf__2hOQXvZG8Oj5cz_DCHs9zfgb-NYaOMt2iFWvxo0oNTTxnp8Cd7n_4jVgFj3R9LR801FtcUqtSQAdclSZrB89jzAhk7qq3-IClIP6pwCT3swehcOA2fdRImtTnkuNpTFPMo9DETSBMFNL1lzuLFfkkOxoH3roQG4-okYkhF1gE85EVm8qi5rAEyRafo6vV36PJNLIzqfv-p6hB9TNh-tGpwUOxSZ-VmQybESQb2t_GdSBEg-7Rc9fTf10E4CCA3PWru_SbgvgrbQy734eHyfNMPWXiLYpIaWWk_B_vYlU6T3SjeP59xvRlkfT5b0exqhqwzcsxb29NgMHFFHhvnmYvrUUndDjvMos6YcDj5VnVSZ70CS2NYHTZ-_Ur1W0DNaiwcwkH406bHURWZ4NZDmlDlj6AEHNZMRrFQtKVp3cgKBuyxsxAQyylZp2pqBF6DrvIH3t9jN984w2JvuRBVVqSceW7tdEofJs1u0J6_uYMt-Mgr7IHw5NEob8lpGwE6iX6C3OnfAFyhlM9hTYLacBqRvSwcl0iF8avVRrIMNx69T2c45MmOmniAJCQMxTNXMw1vcNFNr3WRXkX9mKOkGpLNiUMLevC2EQuL-cMheFPyQqmSXfQK2qizDnUu2h8-qd-v9BJ4WyxZrKsH1iXiq6JBSzcDqfZUn1cr7ahH-mSt5-Ma3snhZWdYTRZAIqKwUpQ61Xlf7pT8aaMJjv8s-N7HyU3D07jwkkPPgtxyHUpELTX2TR8/4m5/o3qIWjVoT6aAVKY3fhd94Q/h17/h001.0aEUpp73aHtYhZkfUBoWjjJXrf5IcLpX_VBIPXiTyVI) slashing staff while pouring more cash into AI.

“Just looking at this with the realist point of view, the vast majority of the CFOs (and) the C-suite out there are not mincing words around trying to be the most efficient, leanest, fastest company,” Habib said.

Agents still have quite a few kinks to work out. All AI systems have similar fundamental issues: data, security, hallucination, and bias. This problem is evident in some of the releases at re:Invent that seek to address those key issues, while placing stringent guardrails on what they can and can’t do. Still, even with new tooling, enterprises would be wise not to treat these agents as full-blown digital coworkers just yet.

# OpenAI’s ‘Garlic’ shows it’s feeling the heat

OpenAI’s house of cards may be starting to wobble, and the company is starting to look like it’s nervously scrambling for answers.

As competition from Google and Anthropic breathes down its neck, OpenAI is reportedly developing a new large language model, code-named “Garlic,” aimed at outperforming rival models in coding and reasoning tasks, according to [The Information](https://elink983.thedeepview.co/ss/c/u001.wZPohD0JH12EksCsbt8ZeNQV17bivccHNL4Xm_RyIen18rHD_phERwdT4lkzXpd0eMh-oTt142DHNefTzgHEXzVavUtCkm4tvhilH8f3_sY9IIITgHItwn5-1ToySYQjiMYtnU9rneJglxcucBwytZfWJnCJ5pPbCLxjAzMIncKXFb8l5pcqB6kPjQOJw7pFMfnUBZPn42KV-MXiswOaB-ebAlCzaW40ttd2oELNM_qPqNxQ2SNsic0RFU-52E_YAcGMp36wJf7SAM0ymgSzkwZEtI2L-hk6Nsag7lkaEJajnDvGyEKoIwUOOlrVT9tAwVGtWrXDwjpy9Xm0cqC3iQ/4m5/o3qIWjVoT6aAVKY3fhd94Q/h21/h001.oGWyCVm78L2U2SuOeXUIc1BJXwodFkQzpMf-cjiIbSw).

And Garlic, which may be released as GPT-5.2 or GPT-5.5 by early next year, isn’t the only sign that OpenAI is sweating.

* The report comes amid rumors that [OpenAI CEO Sam Altman](https://elink983.thedeepview.co/ss/c/u001.gKxW2KpP8aPe_QMyOQduokz26ZHyY7Fg1D8jGBnEADj_CsPYkRpkq0iac30gXPHUGEPAr-7BUev9rlACkQVHwtrN68GXx7mkoc0TR_Sd6pDo5vTJVvocmz1M45fxq9q1F1emDzzeAXUTQO3x1fo2cGzsPFs2bGAoldsSyplgpcFvjF6oyzFJV1JexWHfbjifs6wmrd5oaNUiL1KUm_UZMVIIVTazyxJwjH2OrAar_c88OWn3fsuBF3WRerpaeJn5ZKxIJsGSbqqD7ZQg0g94DOqyYWP1u1RCvr_cpm5TGHCaihKdDAKBjrp3nAVMAE3iRlyavv-8L0y4Zl7_Vlra2Q/4m5/o3qIWjVoT6aAVKY3fhd94Q/h22/h001.RRnSUdLTXGFfPLOpPKGKy1kZKu7ubu2_PMh7qKKOwWM) has signaled a “code red” alert to employees to improve its flagship ChatGPT product, pushing back other product developments to focus on improvements to the chatbot’s speed, reliability and personalization.
* The company also announced on Wednesday that it’s acquiring Neptune, a company that tracks progress and optimizes the AI model training process, for an undisclosed sum. OpenAI has been utilizing Neptune’s products for more than a year, according to [Bloomberg](https://elink983.thedeepview.co/ss/c/u001.wZPohD0JH12EksCsbt8ZeND5z3fn2eA5HMQUmmQlReaKu1tOr8zLo4GQnPW2OaChCgD3rp5SRG3YB_ER02SvKLMDkK9U4e04SCKgsxd5yBK7zLSgbKe-x7vGHqkIS3f9yqrreBYTv6XzxLmvBR7Rr6eigxHQycuFJCEWj9LZ-8lNDSjzwZheCclq1SlIM1IhyykgOyslTCeDaaTXz6TtwqfLCe73rs5cir28yB8QHbcwMwyTrsfVc18u3beAmVXKhJmkAA8qJ2zfc2CPTNEyZWLsvUzhnFG_wMF7oR5O03hssbdPxNREq42RKOZIEclk7w4o7lwJmD8e947mdlWRFIQGg8cLbEXceskaV9A5inA/4m5/o3qIWjVoT6aAVKY3fhd94Q/h23/h001.g2PU1PcYsWAd_icz6zRsDRP6OMnk6ysOvzp9T0S4SLQ).

OpenAI has been the darling of the AI industry since its release of ChatGPT, which just celebrated its third anniversary. But the success of competitors like Google, which has received rave reviews for the recent release of Gemini 3, and Anthropic, which comparatively has seen far more sustainable growth with enterprises, is starting to make OpenAI nervous.

OpenAI has tied much of its fate to scaling its technology by signing deals with tech giants like Nvidia, Oracle, and Amazon. It now has mammoth data center commitments [totalling more than one trillion dollars](https://elink983.thedeepview.co/ss/c/u001.gKxW2KpP8aPe_QMyOQduokBEDIe6892b9r6MySOyoYWInu_u5ZFKM5cHJ7W7RicjceWbbk_HEE-kFHpv_Fn6xJavLCI53u8Ng1eplPeGr2UCQH6GJ-AU9bswwhMAI460iVOxv4X8IsmshPN7Sl5wGVXqYnIOz-TwFgy-hAkO_UIObalqOoHHy1_43ekopD5641Z57JI5xwCQTNxkZa2-1VSFSC3O8g0nkWPyB5CqMBMuHtiAMz32grEH3dlKNETSESFIoV7TC0zELXYlHvhyuSpsvAoUl3fbsTgvVV9VGAgAQ5wdEvSCRtjgcm_K6_UCmiUnRY5QnI4lJWcD76Yxld2XNe4KJfy1XQyo7Iod-S97MtybD5D8M6ACUtyEapM2tdgCOGLK3kS-oZeesWxsvhydFBYy-4mfCd6fAq3_Va48z4Gqwt3BEMKUTTKBTNHlPMhh_YWnl5U0Z6GULWW82o_gPaPjhi2ViphoKjfz4MsPE7vlvbFPAs-8gr311s0Nh9DrBOQAw-ZR5YKGl90ZMpUE5WaYKRoHIX8eSL5KZeBoY0d-rVYbINpU3AxcgUJJ-KyAWhAeKtaSTeB6TD0DU2PSyoemQ5ubyTnAMuoX9AT_nhRzletCupvi2bQzT54c3SuSeQwAT1P7d7GyCKqM9hiTfHgnbszOLbtoDJSnjHJMvwxk4R8cqtSdm1JfGACeEc2nGubVnD9HgFg-7GMTs6pAsImCgrUq2c1pQPKGuHdmsE8NmQWnK3c0eq65aqBmIICcVSTLJHCSqQtoi5-P2NQF9aTeXi4OA_VeLIEb46UP4wImcESC8yPEPNS2FHHIviU8tLlLJbXOizVlnWLxy8gLS_fDtGC6QPx07r7hLWM/4m5/o3qIWjVoT6aAVKY3fhd94Q/h25/h001.Fi_Haekn6M3h1ccTk1qFEqffzo2QGQnhKaG0PA2EL1M) with these and other partners.

I cannot stay in this job anymore and i need some advice,"Hi,  I am currently doing my btech final year as well as working as a consultant at a well known yet so-so company. They make me work 60hrs a week(including sat), it's seen as unprofessional if i come after 10;30 or leave before 8;30. I Had my semester exams in nov, for which they should have taken responsibility for...but i had to use my unpaid leaves to give my exams and then apparently people said i took way too many leaves. 

I KNOW ffs please give me some advice and say something else apart from ""don't leave the job, many people don't have a job"". I know that. what should i even do? It's mentally draining, no matter what i do, eventually people will say you're not doing enough.   
I understand i should be more tough and just tolerate the grind as this is my first job but i hope there are people here older than me who understand spending 60hrs a week doing something you don't like, you're not good in, you're not fitting into.   
plus it obviously doesnt help that im going through the first and worst breakup of my life :)

Comment Améliorer la Qualité du Sperme : Guide Pratique et Conseils,"# Introduction

La [qualité du sperme](https://herbosafe.com) est cruciale pour la fertilité masculine et peut influencer la capacité à concevoir un enfant. De nombreux facteurs, y compris le mode de vie, l'alimentation, et les habitudes de santé, peuvent affecter la qualité du sperme. 

# Qu'est-ce que la Qualité du Sperme ?

La qualité du sperme se réfère à divers paramètres, notamment :

* **Le volume** : La quantité de sperme produite lors d'une éjaculation.
* **La concentration** : Le nombre de spermatozoïdes par millilitre de sperme.
* **La motilité** : La capacité des spermatozoïdes à se déplacer correctement.
* **La morphologie** : La forme et la structure des spermatozoïdes.

Une bonne qualité du sperme est essentielle pour la fertilité. Des problèmes dans l'un de ces domaines peuvent rendre la conception plus difficile.

# Facteurs Influents sur la Qualité du Sperme

# 1. Mode de Vie

Le mode de vie joue un rôle déterminant dans la [qualité du sperme](https://hopital-territoires.com/produit/semenax/). Voici quelques éléments à considérer :

# a. Tabagisme

Fumer du tabac peut avoir des effets négatifs sur la qualité du sperme, réduisant la motilité et augmentant le risque de déformation des spermatozoïdes. Arrêter de fumer peut donc améliorer la qualité du sperme.

# b. Consommation d'Alcool

Une consommation excessive d'alcool influence également la production de sperme. Il est recommandé de limiter l'alcool pour favoriser une meilleure qualité.

# c. Poids Corporel

Le surpoids ou l'obésité peut avoir un impact négatif sur la fertilité. Des études montrent que les hommes ayant un indice de masse corporelle (IMC) élevé peuvent avoir moins de spermatozoïdes et une motilité réduite.

# 2. Alimentation

Une alimentation équilibrée joue également un rôle crucial dans la santé spermatozoïdienne. Voici quelques aliments bénéfiques :

# a. Antioxydants

Les antioxydants, présents dans les fruits et légumes, aident à neutraliser les radicaux libres, ce qui peut améliorer la qualité du sperme. Optez pour des baies, des agrumes, des épinards et des noix.

# b. Acides Gras Oméga-3

Les acides gras oméga-3, que l'on trouve dans les poissons gras comme le saumon, sont également bénéfiques pour la qualité du sperme. Ils contribuent à la production de spermatozoïdes sains.

# c. Zinc et Folate

Les minéraux comme le zinc et le folate sont essentiels pour une production de sperme optimale. Ils peuvent être trouvés dans les légumineuses, les céréales complètes, et les viandes maigres.

# 3. Activité Physique

L'exercice régulier contribue à maintenir un poids sain et peut améliorer la qualité du sperme. Il est conseillé de pratiquer au moins 150 minutes d'exercice modéré par semaine :

# a. Exercice Aérobique

Le cardio, comme la course ou le vélo, aide à améliorer la circulation sanguine, ce qui peut être bénéfique pour la santé reproductive.

# b. Musculation

Des études indiquent que certains exercices de musculation peuvent également avoir un effet positif sur les niveaux de testostérone, contribuant ainsi à la qualité du sperme.

# Éviter les Toxines et les Stress

# 1. Exposition aux Produits Chimiques

Évitez autant que possible l'exposition aux substances toxiques, telles que les pesticides, les métaux lourds, et certains produits chimiques industriels, qui peuvent affecter la qualité du sperme.

# 2. Gestion du Stress

Le stress chronique peut influencer négativement la production de spermatozoïdes. Techniques de gestion du stress comme la méditation, le yoga, ou d'autres formes d'activités relaxantes peuvent s'avérer bénéfiques.

# Méthodes Complémentaires

# 1. Suppléments Nutritionnels

Certaines vitamines et minéraux peuvent soutenir la santé des spermatozoïdes. Voici quelques recommandations :

* **Vitamine C** : Contribue à la protection des spermatozoïdes contre les dommages oxydatifs.
* **Vitamine E** : Joue un rôle dans la motilité des spermatozoïdes.
* **Acides gras oméga-3** : Aident à promouvoir une bonne qualité des spermatozoïdes.

Avant d'entreprendre un régime de suppléments, il est toujours préférable de consulter un professionnel de santé.

# 2. Éviter la Surcharge Thermique

La chaleur peut avoir des effets néfastes sur la production de sperme. Des activités comme l'utilisation fréquente de saunas ou de bains chauds peuvent affecter la qualité. Privilégiez un environnement frais pour les testicules.

# Quand Consulter un Médecin ?

Si, malgré des efforts pour améliorer la qualité du sperme, vous rencontrez toujours des problèmes de fertilité, il est conseillé de consulter un professionnel de santé. Un spécialiste de la fertilité peut réaliser des tests et proposer des solutions adaptées.

# Tests Courants

* **Analyse du Sperme** : Évaluation des différents paramètres de la qualité du sperme.
* **Consultation Hormones** : Vérification des niveaux hormonaux qui pourraient impacter la fertilité.

# Conclusion

Améliorer la qualité du sperme est possible par des changements de mode de vie adaptés, une alimentation équilibrée et la gestion du stress. 

Les efforts pour optimiser la santé reproductive peuvent non seulement faciliter la conception, mais aussi améliorer le bien-être général. Si vous avez des préoccupations concernant votre fertilité, n'hésitez pas à consulter un professionnel de santé pour obtenir un diagnostic et des conseils avisés.",Phalloforte,1perbph,menproducts,05-12-2025,11:04:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/menproducts/comments/1perbph/comment_améliorer_la_qualité_du_sperme_guide/
Is my Invisalign treatment fit for an overbite / overjet fix? And anyone had a missing front tooth fake fix during the treatment? Need support.,"Hi! 

Concerned that my treatment plan is not going to fix my overbite / overjet. Not sure which one I have tbh, but the front upper teeth alignment is definitely something I want to fix. 

Currently on a tray 4/26, with 10 days in between. 

First pics are before the treatment, and attached is the ClinCheck plan before and after 26th. 
Doing my teeth to progress with dental implants afterwards, and also moving my front teeth back to the centre. Had a long journey with my teeth before that as well, thus a lot of missing. Did say at the consultation that I want my overbite fixed, but now I’m sad and concerned that the 260 days plan will not get me there… because I have more restrictions than normal and certainly need to get over the treatment as soon as possible. 

The main restriction I have is that my front top teeth is missing, and orthodontist had to take down my dental bridge with an artificial replacement tooth. The trays I have got “pre-filled” composit missing teeth so that when I wear trays it looks like it’s there. It also means that everytime I remove trays I am very conscious of not having a front tooth, and being 30smth year old working a corporate job is not great for socialising…

What are your thoughts on my treatment plan? And has anybody had the missing tooth temporary fix while treating with Invisalign?

Have a consultation with my orthodontist soon, but I am concerned that 260 days will not be enough… any support and advice appreciated🙏 thank you!",Waveaftrwave,1perbc1,Invisalign,05-12-2025,11:03:35,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1perbc1

Comprendre les Extenseurs de Pénis,"# Introduction

Les [extenseurs de pénis](https://hopital-territoires.com/penis/phallosan-forte) sont des dispositifs conçus pour augmenter la taille du pénis, en longueur et parfois en circonférence. Leur popularité a connu une hausse ces dernières années, avec de nombreux hommes cherchant des solutions pour améliorer leur confiance en soi ou répondre à des préoccupations esthétiques. 

# Qu'est-ce qu'un Extenseur de Pénis ?

Un extenseur de pénis est un dispositif mécanique qui exerce une traction sur le pénis dans le but de l'allonger. Il se compose généralement de deux anneaux auxquels sont fixés des tiges, permettant d'appliquer une force d'étirement. Cette méthode repose sur le principe de la traction, qui a été utilisée dans diverses disciplines médicales pour favoriser la régénération des tissus.

# Comment Fonctionnent les Extenseurs de Pénis ?

# Principe de la Traction

Le principe de base derrière les extenseurs de pénis est l'application d'une traction prolongée. En exerçant une pression continue sur le pénis, le corps réagit en produisant de nouvelles cellules, ce qui peut, dans certains cas, aboutir à une augmentation de la longueur du pénis. Ce processus est similaire à celui utilisé dans la médecine orthopédique pour corriger les malformations osseuses.

# Types d'Extenseurs

Il existe plusieurs types d'extenseurs de pénis, notamment :

1. **Extenseurs Mécaniques** : Dispositifs manuels qui nécessitent que l'utilisateur applique une force pour étirer le pénis.
2. **Extenseurs Électriques** : Dispositifs motorisés qui automatisent le processus d'étirement. Ces appareils peuvent être plus confortables, mais souvent plus coûteux.

# Efficacité des Extenseurs de Pénis

# Études et Résultats

Plusieurs études cliniques ont été menées pour évaluer l'efficacité des extenseurs de pénis. Les résultats varient, mais certaines études indiquent qu'une utilisation régulière peut conduire à une augmentation de la longueur du pénis d'environ 1 à 3 centimètres au cours de plusieurs mois.

# Facteurs Influents

L’efficacité des extenseurs dépend de plusieurs facteurs :

* **Durée d’utilisation** : Des sessions prolongées et régulières sont souvent nécessaires pour obtenir des résultats.
* **Conformité** : La volonté de l'utilisateur de suivre le programme d'entraînement est cruciale.
* **Techniques d'utilisation** : L'utilisation correcte de l'appareil, en évitant de trop forcer, maximise les chances de succès.

# Résultats Variables

Il est important de noter que les résultats peuvent varier d'une personne à l'autre. Certains hommes peuvent voir des améliorations significatives, tandis que d'autres peuvent ne pas remarquer de changement. La stimulation de la croissance dépend aussi de facteurs biologiques propres à chaque individu.

# Méthodes d’Utilisation des Extenseurs de Pénis

Pour maximiser les bénéfices des extenseurs de pénis, voici quelques conseils d'utilisation :

# 1. Respecter le Temps d’Utilisation

Commencez par des sessions de 30 minutes, puis augmentez progressivement jusqu'à deux heures par jour. Assurez-vous de permettre des périodes de repos pour éviter l'irritation.

# 2. Installation Correcte

Lisez attentivement le mode d'emploi et assurez-vous que l'extenseur est correctement fixé. Un ajustement approprié réduit le risque d'inconfort et de blessures.

# 3. Patience et Persévérance

Les résultats n'apparaissent pas du jour au lendemain. Une utilisation régulière et à long terme est essentielle pour observer des changements.

# 4. Entretenir une Bonne Hygiène

Assurez-vous de nettoyer régulièrement l'appareil pour éviter les infections. Une bonne hygiène est essentielle pour la santé sexuelle.

# Sécurité et Précautions à Prendre

# 1. Consulter un Professionnel de Santé

Avant d'utiliser un extenseur de pénis, il est judicieux de consulter un médecin ou un spécialiste de la santé. Ils pourront évaluer vos besoins et vous conseiller sur les meilleures pratiques.

# 2. Éviter les Excès

Ne pas trop tirer sur l'appareil et éviter les sessions d'utilisation excessivement longues. Une utilisation excessive peut conduire à des douleurs ou des blessures.

# 3. Écouter Son Corps

Si vous ressentez une douleur ou un inconfort important, cessez l'utilisation immédiatement. Il est essentiel de ne pas ignorer les signaux de votre corps.

# 4. Connaître les Risques

Bien que les extenseurs de pénis soient généralement considérés comme sûrs, ils peuvent entraîner des complications comme des hématomes, des pertes de sensation ou des troubles érectiles si utilisés de manière inappropriée.

# Alternatives aux Extenseurs de Pénis

Si vous n'êtes pas convaincu par l'utilisation d'extenseurs de pénis, d'autres options existent :

# 1. Thérapie Médicale

Certaines interventions médicales, comme la chirurgie pénienne, peuvent offrir des résultats plus rapides, mais elles comportent également des risques plus élevés.

# 2. Médicaments et Supplements

Des produits comme les pilules ou les crèmes pour augmenter la taille du pénis sont disponibles, mais leur efficacité est souvent contestée et elles peuvent parfois causer des effets secondaires.

# 3. Approches Psychologiques

Il est important de travailler sur l'estime de soi et les attentes. Parfois, des préoccupations liées à la taille du pénis sont plus liées à des problèmes de confiance qu'à la taille réelle.

# Conclusion

Les extenseurs de pénis sont une option pour les hommes souhaitant augmenter la taille de leur pénis. Bien qu'ils puissent offrir des résultats, il est crucial d'approcher cette méthode avec prudence et réalisme. 

Une utilisation correcte, en respectant les recommandations médicales et en tenant compte des faits scientifiques, peut optimiser l'expérience. Avant d'entreprendre une telle démarche, il est recommandé de consulter un professionnel de la santé pour en discuter.

# FAQ

**1. Les extenseurs de pénis sont-ils efficaces ?**  
Oui, des études montrent qu'une utilisation régulière peut mener à une augmentation modeste de la taille. Les résultats varient selon les individus.

**2. Est-ce que l'utilisation d'un extenseur est douloureuse ?**  
Cela dépend de l'ajustement et de l'utilisation de l'appareil. Un bon ajustement minimise le risque d'inconfort.

**3. Combien de temps faut-il pour voir des résultats ?**  
Les résultats peuvent apparaître après plusieurs mois d'utilisation régulière, mais certaines personnes peuvent ne pas voir de changement significatif.

"Engine blew up, transparent fundraising campaign, please read our caption","Since purchasing our Octavia in May 2024, we have been on a repair shop odyssey that has worn us down as a family. Instead of a reliable family car, we have had appointments, queries, excuses, and bills from the very beginning. From our point of view, a lot has been billed, but the actual problem has never been solved. The dealership, a brand partner, carried out a major repair on the cooling system. To do this, the timing belt was removed but not replaced. Only the water pump was replaced; the belt and rollers remained in place. The car then remained at the dealership, citing a backlog of work, until the warranty and guarantee expired. Our written requests for inspections, such as an endoscopy of the cylinders and an examination of the cylinder head, were not carried out or never documented. There was no response to our request for rectification. We also consulted other specialist workshops. There were new diagnoses and new costs, but no lasting remedy. The manufacturer refused to be accommodating, even though the vehicle had not even clocked up 100,000 kilometers.

It was only the independent workshop that clearly identified the problem. The timing belt had jumped, the timing was incorrect, the cylinder head gasket was defective, water had entered the combustion chambers, and several injectors were damaged. The car was only drivable from May to December 2024 and again from May to July 2025. It was stationary for all other months. In figures, this means, in addition to the purchase price of 22,600 euros for a major repair to the cooling system costing just under 9,600 euros, of which 1,600 euros is the customer's share, plus towing and minor items costing around 2,900 euros. Now we have a cost estimate of €9,647.09 for engine repairs. Meanwhile, the loan continues to run, and without a car, it is almost impossible to get to doctor's appointments, go shopping, and visit family.

We are people who usually help others, drive them around, repair things, and often end up paying for it ourselves. It is difficult for us to ask for support. After everything we have been through, however, all we can do is be honest about how we feel. We were not taken seriously by several specialist workshops, we were strung along and ultimately left to deal with the consequences on our own. We now need help so that our child can sit safely in the car again and we can regain a sense of normality as a family. Every message shared and every contribution brings us closer to this goal.

Why Young Adults Are Facing Massive Hair Loss in 2025 - And How Homeopathy Can Reverse It,"Hair loss is rising fast among young adults, and 2025 is expected to see even more cases. Students, professionals, and even teenagers are reporting thinning hair, dandruff, breakage, and early balding. The reasons are linked to modern lifestyle habits, stress, and hormonal changes - but the good news is that homeopathy offers a gentle and effective solution.





Why Hair Fall Is Increasing in Young Adults

1. Stress & Fast Lifestyle

High stress from studies, work pressure, and late-night screen use affects hormone levels. This triggers sudden shedding and weak roots.



2. Nutritional Gaps

A diet low in protein, iron, and essential vitamins leads to breakage, dullness, and slow hair growth.



3. Hormonal Imbalance

PCOS, thyroid issues, and irregular cycles are now common in young women. Men, too, experience early hormonal changes that weaken follicles.



4. Dandruff & Scalp Infections

Fungal infections, psoriasis, and stubborn dandruff are major reasons behind patchy hair loss.



5. Chemical Hair Products

Frequent colouring, smoothing, straightening, and heat styling damage the natural hair structure.

How Homeopathy Helps Reverse Hair Fall





Homeopathy treats hair fall from the root by correcting internal imbalances. It balances hormones, reduces stress, improves scalp health, and strengthens follicles naturally. This is why many young adults now prefer homeopathy over chemical-based treatments.

If you want expert-guided treatment, you can consult the best homeopathy clinic for safe, long-term results.



Best Homeopathic Medicines for Hair Loss

Some commonly used remedies include Fluoric Acid, Phosphorus, Lycopodium, Graphites, Silicea, and Natrum Mur. These medicines help with dandruff, split ends, weak hair roots, and hormonal hair fall.

Final Thoughts

Hair fall among young adults is increasing due to stress, lifestyle issues, and nutritional imbalance. Homeopathy offers a natural, safe, and holistic way to reverse this problem. With the right approach and early treatment, strong and healthy hair growth is completely possible.

URGENT QCAT Dispute: Should I Defend or Use Insurance? Need Legal Strategy Advice (QLD Renter),"Hello r/AusLegal community, I am facing a QCAT Minor Civil Dispute (MCD) claim for property damage and need immediate guidance on my best strategic path to minimise costs.

I accidentally damaged the communal garage door (approx. 20 years old), informed to my real estate agent showing sign of a good tenant and my guilty of accidentally damaging door on July 2, 2025.

Timeline & Payment:

1. July 15: Paid $786.50 immediately for the repair requested by the Body Corporate (BC). Assumed liability was settled.

2. Sept 15: BC send new quote of  $6,102.00 for a full replacement. I refused, citing unlawful betterment (""new for old"") after consultation with my real estate agent and send email by saying I’ll lodge dispute with RTA if not settled but did not receive any response from them until I received today a 40 page detail letter saying my BC has lodged a dispute with QCAT.

3. Dec 1: Received a QCAT application for the remaining $5,317.00.

My Defence:

1. Unlawful Betterment: The original door was 20 years old. I argue I'm only liable for the low depreciated value, which is potentially covered by my initial $786.50 payment.

2. Mitigation of Loss: The BC chose the $6,102 quote over a cheaper $4,175 quote.

The Cost Dilemma: I have Third Party Insurance with an $895.00 excess.

Which path is the best strategic choice to minimise my out-of-pocket costs and settle this?

1. Defend in QCAT: Lodge my strong betterment/depreciation defence, aiming for $0 additional payment (on top of the $786.50 already paid).

2. Hand to my Car insurance: Notify my insurer, pay the $895.00 excess, and let them handle the claim to settle quickly.

I need to decide my path now while preparing the QCAT response. Is the depreciation argument strong enough in QCAT to risk fighting, or is paying the excess the safest option?

Thanks for any insights! 🙏

"Comprendre la Vasectomie : Principes, Avantages et Considérations","# Introduction

La vasectomie est une méthode de contraception masculine permanente de plus en plus prisée. Bien qu'elle ait été pratiquée depuis des décennies, elle demeure entourée de mythes et de malentendus. 

# Qu'est-ce que la Vasectomie ?

La vasectomie est une procédure chirurgicale visant à couper et à sceller les canaux déférents, qui transportent les spermatozoïdes des testicules vers l'urètre. Ce processus empêche le sperme de se mélanger au liquide séminal, rendant ainsi l'éjaculation inexploitable pour la procréation.

# Types de Vasectomie

Il existe deux méthodes principales de vasectomie :

1. **Vasectomie Chirurgicale** : Cette méthode implique une petite incision dans le scrotum pour accéder aux canaux déférents. Le chirurgien coupe, ligature, puis scelle chaque canal.
2. **Vasectomie Sans Scalpel** : Utilisant une technique moins invasive, cette méthode nécessite seulement une petite piqûre pour accéder aux canaux déférents, ce qui réduit les risques de complication et améliore la récupération.

# Avantages de la Vasectomie

# 1. Méthode de Contraception Fiable

La vasectomie est l'une des méthodes de contraception les plus fiables, avec un taux d'échecs inférieur à 1 %. Une fois la procédure effectuée et confirmée par des tests, elle élimine la nécessité d'utiliser d'autres [méthodes contraceptives](https://herbosafe.com/).

# 2. Réversibilité Potentielle

Bien que la vasectomie soit considérée comme permanente, il existe des procédures de réversibilité. Cependant, la réussite de ces interventions n'est pas garantie et dépend de plusieurs facteurs, notamment le temps écoulé depuis la vasectomie initiale.

# 3. Moins de Risques de Complications

Comparée à d'autres interventions chirurgicales, la vasectomie présente un faible risque de complications. Les effets secondaires sont généralement minimes et incluent un léger inconfort ou un gonflement temporaire.

# 4. Pas d'Impact sur la Libido

Contrairement à certains mythes, la vasectomie n'affecte pas la libido, l'[érection](https://hopital-territoires.com/) ou la qualité du sperme. Les hommes continuent d'avoir des rapports sexuels normaux, et l'éjaculation se produit de manière habituelle, bien qu'elle ne contienne plus de spermatozoïdes.

# 5. Prise en Charge Économique

À long terme, la vasectomie peut être une option financièrement avantageuse, en éliminant les frais liés aux contraceptifs, aux préservatifs et à d'autres méthodes à court terme.

# Considérations Avant une Vasectomie

# 1. Réflexion Personnelle

Avant de décider de subir une vasectomie, il est crucial de réfléchir à votre situation personnelle. Souhaitez-vous avoir des enfants à l'avenir, ou êtes-vous certain que votre famille est complète ? Une discussion franche avec votre partenaire peut aider à éclaircir ces questions.

# 2. Consultation Médicale

Il est recommandé de consulter un professionnel de santé qualifié pour discuter de vos options. Un médecin peut vous informer sur la procédure, les risques potentiels, et répondre à vos questions.

# 3. Évaluation des Risques

Comme toute intervention chirurgicale, la vasectomie comporte des risques. Bien qu'ils soient rares, des complications telles qu'une infection, une douleur persistante ou une hémorragie peuvent survenir. Assurez-vous d'être informé des risques avant de prendre une décision.

# 4. Suivi Post-Opératoire

Après la vasectomie, il est important de suivre les directives post-opératoires fournies par votre médecin. Cela inclut la surveillance des signes d'infection et la planification d'un rendez-vous de suivi pour confirmer l'absence de spermatozoïdes dans le sperme.

# Myths et Réalités sur la Vasectomie

# Mythe 1 : La Vasectomie est Irréversible

Réalité : Bien que la vasectomie soit considérée comme permanente, des procédures chirurgicales peuvent tenter de rétablir la fertilité. Cependant, ces procédures ne garantissent pas un succès total.

# Mythe 2 : La Vasectomie Affecte le Comportement Sexuel

Réalité : La vasectomie n'affecte pas la libido ni les performances sexuelles. Les hommes peuvent continuer à éprouver du plaisir sexuel de la même manière qu'avant.

# Mythe 3 : La Vasectomie Conduit à des Problèmes de Santé

Réalité : Les études ne montrent aucune corrélation significative entre la vasectomie et des problèmes de santé à long terme, tels que le cancer de la prostate.

# Conclusion

La vasectomie est une méthode de contraception efficace et sécurisée qui mérite d'être envisagée par les hommes souhaitant éviter une paternité future. En pesant soigneusement les avantages et les considérations, et en se concertant avec des professionnels de la santé, vous pouvez prendre une décision éclairée qui répondra à vos besoins.

# FAQ

**1. La vasectomie est-elle douloureuse ?**  
La plupart des hommes ressentent un léger inconfort pendant et après la procédure, mais cela est généralement bien géré avec des analgésiques.

**2. Quels sont les délais de récupération après une vasectomie ?**  
La plupart des hommes peuvent reprendre des activités normales après quelques jours, mais il est recommandé d'éviter les activités physiques intenses pendant environ une semaine.

**3. Quand puis-je être sûr que la vasectomie fonctionne ?**  
Un test de sperme doit être réalisé environ 8 à 12 semaines après la vasectomie pour confirmer l'absence de spermatozoïdes.

En étant bien informé et préparé, vous pouvez envisager la vasectomie comme une option sérieuse et bénéfique pour votre avenir reproductif.",Phalloforte,1per7su,menproducts,05-12-2025,10:57:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/menproducts/comments/1per7su/comprendre_la_vasectomie_principes_avantages_et/
"Engine blew up, transparent fundraising campaign, please read our caption","Since purchasing our Octavia in May 2024, we have been on a repair shop odyssey that has worn us down as a family. Instead of a reliable family car, we have had appointments, queries, excuses, and bills from the very beginning. From our point of view, a lot has been billed, but the actual problem has never been solved. The dealership, a brand partner, carried out a major repair on the cooling system. To do this, the timing belt was removed but not replaced. Only the water pump was replaced; the belt and rollers remained in place. The car then remained at the dealership, citing a backlog of work, until the warranty and guarantee expired. Our written requests for inspections, such as an endoscopy of the cylinders and an examination of the cylinder head, were not carried out or never documented. There was no response to our request for rectification. We also consulted other specialist workshops. There were new diagnoses and new costs, but no lasting remedy. The manufacturer refused to be accommodating, even though the vehicle had not even clocked up 100,000 kilometers.

It was only the independent workshop that clearly identified the problem. The timing belt had jumped, the timing was incorrect, the cylinder head gasket was defective, water had entered the combustion chambers, and several injectors were damaged. The car was only drivable from May to December 2024 and again from May to July 2025. It was stationary for all other months. In figures, this means, in addition to the purchase price of 22,600 euros for a major repair to the cooling system costing just under 9,600 euros, of which 1,600 euros is the customer's share, plus towing and minor items costing around 2,900 euros. Now we have a cost estimate of €9,647.09 for engine repairs. Meanwhile, the loan continues to run, and without a car, it is almost impossible to get to doctor's appointments, go shopping, and visit family.

We are people who usually help others, drive them around, repair things, and often end up paying for it ourselves. It is difficult for us to ask for support. After everything we have been through, however, all we can do is be honest about how we feel. We were not taken seriously by several specialist workshops, we were strung along and ultimately left to deal with the consequences on our own. We now need help so that our child can sit safely in the car again and we can regain a sense of normality as a family. Every message shared and every contribution brings us closer to this goal.

feeling hopeful 🙏🏻😭,"i just joined this sub, and have looked at a plethora of before/afters and am started to get excited. i might be getting too excited so far, as i don’t have a surgery scheduled yet or even know if my insurance will cover all of it. i just have a consultation appt with a surgeon in February. but my medical team & i think we have a pretty solid case. 

for some background info, i (27F) have had very large breasts since highschool. as i’ve developed as an adult, they have grown significantly and stay around the same size even with my weight fluctuations. i’m not exactly sure my correct bra size as i wear sports bras, im somewhere around 38F. i do have a very small rib cage, and the excess weight of my boobs has has a tremendous toll on my neck and back over the years. i’ve dealt with this pain for so long, i don’t know what it’s like to deal without it. not only the physical pain- the insecurity, not being able to wear what i want, the hyper-sexualization of my body. even at my smallest weight when i could barely eat anything and was scared for my health a year ago, which was 150lbs (i’m 5’11” for reference) they were still huge and not proportionate to my frame. i’ve been going to a chiropractor religiously for 6 years. tried physical therapy, stretches, done a lot of strength training, and nothing helps. 

i’ve been dreaming of a breast reduction since i was 16 years old. i’ve always brought it up to doctors, maybe not as much as i should have in the past. but i finally have a PCP that actually listens, and wants to help. she referred me to a plastic surgeon here in my state, and the consultation is in a couple of months. 

although i haven’t even gone yet, i finally feel SEEN. like the frequent debilitating pain from these damn melons isn’t just all in my head. i’m finally on an actual path to living the life i’ve always wanted to live, without feeling the need to hide, without these two giant burdens on my chest. i’m scared to have too much hope just to get let down, but i can’t help it. i will do all that i can in my power to get this done once and for all.

thanks for reading this far if you have. 🙏🏻 if anyone has any suggestions or advice for me in this stage of the process, please feel free to leave it. the stories i’ve been reading here have been giving me the most hope i’ve had in years. 🩷",Potential-Less,1per6xu,Reduction,05-12-2025,10:56:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reduction/comments/1per6xu/feeling_hopeful/

Anyone else's petitions stuck in review?,"I've got two Parliamentary petitions on immigration currently in review. In particular, one (aimed at allowing skilled worker visa holders who marry a British citizen to switch to a family visa and use their accrued time in the UK towards the family visa 5-year ILR route) reached the threshold of 5 supporters and was sent for review on 14 Oct.

I keep an eye on the Parliamentary petitions Blue sky feed, which gives the dates of any rejected petitions, and can see that petitions submitted later than mine are going through the review process and being rejected.

Has anyone else noticed this?

Company refuses to employ freelancer but expects him to work like an employee,"Also posted in uaelaw, but crossposting here for visibility. I'm less interested in legal advice and more curious about similar experiences.

A relative of mine is working for a european company as a contractor. He's based in Dubai and has a freelance visa/license, but he's treated like a full time employee business wise so the setup worked fine for him.

The company is now formally expanding to the Middle East and has therefore opened a mainland entity and a physical office in Dubai.
My relative asked if he could be moved over to a proper employment contract since there's no need for him to pay his own health insurance and visa costs if the company can just take that over.

To his surprise they refused and want to keep him on a contractor agreement for now. It's strange because he's been with the company for years and there haven't been any HR related issues or any other problems of that sort in the past.


What's wild is that they now asked him to come to the office regurlaly, which he is happy to do but not as a contractor.

I advised him to talk to a lawyer because surely this can't be legal, but he worries that they'll just get rid of him if he pursues any legal action.
He'd be fine with it if he was to get a severance package, and his contractor agreement does say that they have a notice period of 3 months, but he thinks since he's not legally employed he doesn't have any real leverage.

I have no idea on the legality of this situation and I adviced him to definitely consult a lawyer regardless.

But I'd be curious to know myself what his options are here, because it's a pretty strange situation.

Should I stay?,"Hello! I am currently a 2nd resident from a cutting field. Coming 3rd year this January. *fingers crossed

Can you tell me if I should stay?

🔸The junior consultants are trying to make you quit (e.g. giving you excessive demerits without even giving you time beforehand to correct the problem, fyi no patient was harmed by this mistake; obviously asks multiple questions during preop and postop until you cannot answer anymore [they are not like this to other residents]; actively trying to search for some mistakes and make a big deal out of it) 

🔸A lot of the senior consultants still believes in you

My current mantra is to survive everyday. Objectively, they cant dismiss me as I am the top of my batch and I think this is the reason they are trying to attack me this way. I don’t want to quit because I will never let them win. But what if this will break me eventually?

Bankruptcy Consultation Fees?,"I am starting a bankruptcy division at my firm. Chapter 7 and 13.

For our other practice areas (primarily litigation) we charge a $250 consultation fee for a 1 hour phone meeting.

Would this work for bankruptcy? I am envisioning having the prospective clients complete an intake form beforehand so that I can go over options with them. They would receive advice and value from the consult.

At the same time, it just feels bad and I think it would be a barrier for many. Other practitioners in the area do free consults, but there are not many BK attorneys in my jurisdiction.

I have also contemplated charging the consult fee and then applying that towards the flat fee if they hire. Another option is doing free consultations for 30 minutes.

Ultimately it is not up to me, my boss will decide, but I want to have a meaningful discussion and come up with an option that works so that we can do this successfully.

Masters in Netherlands - September 2026. 3+ years experience,"Hi all. My\_Qualifications: I graduated in 2023 with a BSc (Honours) in Economics and Mathematics (4 years program). My cGPA is 3.20/4.00 and I'm planning to give GMAT next month (aiming for 600+). I have work experience of 2.5+ years (3+ years by masters start) in AI-Centric Tech Sales (my recent experience being as an Account Manager in a big US SaaS company). I am planning to do my Masters in either:

1. Business Information Management - Erasmus University Rotterdam
2. Business Information Technology Management - UvA
3. Business Analytics or Business Informatics or Digital Business and Innovation from UvA, VU, or Utrecht

Ideally, I would like to step into CSM/AM/Product/consulting in a tech company in NL post masters. I have a few questions and would really appreciate any help.

1. How hard is it to get into the programs I mentioned with my profile? (I checked my eligibility already and I am eligible)
2. Are these programs well reputed in the NL job market?
3. How hard is it to secure a job in NL with global tech experience for a non EU masters graduate?
4. Is the housing crisis as bad as people say? Especially in big cities like Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Incase I don't end up getting accommodation, I do have an option to live at my relative's place in Utrecht during my master's as he will be travelling. But I would like to have my own student accommodation.

Any advice from someone studying/ working in NL would be highly appreciated. I'm open to any further information regarding masters in NL.

Whats your take on customer requesting you ONLY,"I've been awarded the overall most positive reviews for the last quarter. So my customer service is good, almost too good. 

I work in person at a TeleCo retail store. We get so much foot traffic that we HAVE to have an appointment systems otherwise there's no structure. 

I usually spend 30minutes with each customer, an hour at most. I recently had a few experiences where a customer's request became too unreasonable or not even relevant to the services the company provides.

  
Its fine for like 3 appointments but when you refuse to see any other consultants is when it becomes excessive. I use to give out when I worked to customer's but this pattern has made me pull back. 



The most extreme case I've had was, a lady pre ordered the iPhone, changed her mind a few days later about the colour so we had to waive and redo the whole contract (which was fine). She introduced me to both her kids. The phone was delivered to the store and she came in at a time I wasn't working, the consultant attempted to transfer her data but there was an issue. So she requested to see me a week later. She sees me a week later, the same issue is happening. 

  
Issue: when transferring the data the quoted time given by the phones was 12 hours. I troubleshooted both the phones, and offered to explain how to the transfer at home. Since she had over 10,000 photos and videos, an iphone 11, and the wifi instore is being used by at least 20 people, it was mostly that the phone just needed a more reliable connection. Customer did not want to do the transfer and wanted to get the phone replaced (warranty).

  
I submit the warranty claim, this takes a week since the store is a state away from where the phone techs are. They say nothing is wrong and just reinstall the software and send it back. 

The customer returns, I explain the situation and she refuses to take the phone and wants to submit a complaint. I do that. 

I forgot to mention: the pre order iPhone had a trade in bonus. But since the same team that does warranty also does trade in. They only accept one request per mobile service so the trade in offer was cancelled. This was mentioned in the complaint. It was a few hundred dollars bonus. 

During the complaint appointment she introduced me to her mother, and we resolved a Wifi issue. 

Skip to a week after, I take a few days off because I'm sick. I come to find out she sat down with someone who is less friendly then me.

The situation was escalated to the Area manager, the consultant who she sat with ended up swearing at her, walking out and refusing to see her? And she was banned from getting any other phones in the store. She was given the trade in bonus and another iPhone. The store didn't have stock so it was ordered it in. It arrived a few days later but she didn't collect it for a few weeks. 

It was expressed to her that she would only be talking to managers since they knew the situation. 

She ended up still booking in for me, and since I had given her my workdays I was there. The managers ended up ​sending me home early, and I was warned that if there was unreasonable demands from customers in the future then we have to refuse and not keep escalating. 

The lady kept praising me to my manager but the whole thing ended up reflecting badly on my ability to judge whether a case needs escalation or not. 

The lady was nice but it becomes way too personal after a few appointments, the professionism goes away when you start seeing people that often. Let alone meet their family members.

I should've just taken the bad review instead of escalating a complaint. And pushed her to take the phone and transfer herself. 

  
And for those curious, she did raise a complaint against the other consultant who swore at her. 

Also we as a store are not obligated to transfer data, its upto the consultant on if they want to spend 30minutes to a few hours babysitting someone's phone.

Are You Looking For the Best Lawyers for a Divorce Case? Here’s What You Should Know,"Going through a divorce is stressful, and having the right lawyer can make a huge difference. If you’re searching for the best divorce lawyer, here are a few things that actually matter (beyond flashy ads):

1. Experience in Family Courts
Choose someone who regularly appears in Family Court and understands procedures for custody, maintenance, RCR, and DV cases.

2. Clear Communication
A good lawyer will explain your options in simple language—no confusing legal jargon. You should always feel updated about your case.

3. Strategy, Not Just Emotion
Divorce cases can get emotional. A skilled lawyer keeps the focus on legal strategy and protects your rights without unnecessary complications.

4. Mediation & Settlement Skills
Not every case should turn into a long courtroom battle. A strong lawyer knows when to push for settlement and when to fight.

5. Transparent Fees
Look for someone who clearly mentions consultation charges, case fees, and additional expenses. No surprises later.

6. Client Reviews & Past Case Handling
Check reviews, talk to previous clients if possible, and make sure the lawyer has handled similar cases—contested or mutual.

7. Comfort & Trust
This is important. You’re sharing personal details. You must feel comfortable, respected, and heard.",Miserable_Pilot_4112,1peqliy,LegalAdviceIndia,05-12-2025,10:17:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceIndia/comments/1peqliy/are_you_looking_for_the_best_lawyers_for_a/

Intestinal noises every day,"I have a problem. For context, I am 24(f), about 115lbs. I have and am currently consulting my doctor on this issue, just kind of desperate for some other perspectives or answers.

For the last few months, my intestines and sometimes my stomach have been making loud noises every day. I had something like this happen a few years ago, but it only happened once a week, and it stopped happening and I stopped even thinking about it. since last year, I have occasionally had noises after eating, and since August this year it’s been an every day occurence and not even necessarily after eating. I’ve been tested for ulcers and celiac and have neither, I don’t have any known allergies, I don’t have diarrhea or constipation as far as I can tell, my stool bounces between being solid and good size, to coming in smaller bits, to being pretty loose. I don’t usually struggle with bloating or abdominal pain but every once in a while these happen. I eat fiber, I exercise, I don’t have any other health conditions as far as I’m aware.

Ive tried adjusting my diet, and sometimes things seem to work, but then I get bad again. I’ve tried cutting out foods, but sometimes I’ll eat the exact same thing for a couple days and feel fine and then boom, on the third day, horrible noises again. like a cat dying. I’ve tried digestive enzymes, adding probiotics to my diet, going on omeprazole for a month, chewing gas relief tablets, literally burping a lot after having a meal, but nothing seems to be working long term.

Writing this because I just had two good days, ate the same things today as I did the past two days, and suddenly today I felt like a small balloon inflated in my abdomen and the noises started and went on for hours.

I am desperate for advice at this point because honestly when it happens it’s horribly embarrassing. When it happens at work I want to shrink away and disappear but I can’t. I don’t want to just hide away for the rest of my life, I want to go back to the way things were. I don’t know what could be wrong with me but I know something is. this is really making life impossible to enjoy at all. there’s probably information I forgot to add, so feel free to ask for clarification. and if you think you know what might be wrong, or you have advice, or even if you’ve gone through something similar, please let me know!! it means a lot!",AcademicMagician9977,1peql0t,DiagnoseMe,05-12-2025,10:16:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1peql0t/intestinal_noises_every_day/
Hack The Box AI Cyber Range: Een Cruciale Investering in Cybersecurity en Financiële Veerkracht,"

In een tijdperk waarin cyberaanvallen steeds geavanceerder worden, lanceert Hack The Box een baanbrekend platform: de Hack The Box AI Cyber Range. Deze innovatie is specifiek ontworpen om de paraatheid van enterprise security teams naar een hoger niveau te tillen. Traditionele trainingsmethoden, zoals statische scenario's en capture-the-flag-oefeningen, bieden vaak onvoldoende voorbereiding op de dynamische en onvoorspelbare aanvallen van vandaag, die veelal door AI worden aangedreven. Het falen om adequaat te trainen resulteert niet alleen in technische kwetsbaarheden, maar creëert ook een significant financieel risico. Een succesvolle inbreuk kan leiden tot miljoenen aan kosten door operationele downtime, dataherstel, boetes en reputatieschade. Vanuit een FinOps-perspectief is investeren in realistische en adaptieve training daarom geen kostenpost, maar een strategische zet om de financiële veerkracht van de organisatie te waarborgen en de potentiële impact van een cyberincident proactief te minimaliseren.



De kracht van de nieuwe AI Cyber Range van Hack The Box schuilt in de hyperrealistische en dynamische trainingsomgeving die het creëert. In tegenstelling tot voorgeprogrammeerde oefeningen, maakt het platform gebruik van generatieve AI om continu nieuwe en onvoorspelbare aanvalsscenario's te ontwikkelen. Deze simulaties vinden plaats in een omgeving die de complexe IT-infrastructuur van een moderne onderneming nauwkeurig nabootst, inclusief cloud-omgevingen, on-premise systemen en diverse applicaties. Hierdoor kunnen security teams de volledige incident response cyclus oefenen – van detectie en analyse tot indamming en herstel – in een veilige, gecontroleerde setting. Een essentieel onderdeel zijn de gedetailleerde analyses en prestatiemetrics die na elke sessie worden geleverd. Deze data-gedreven feedback stelt management in staat om de effectiviteit van hun teams objectief te meten, specifieke vaardigheidstekorten te identificeren en trainingsbudgetten gerichter en efficiënter in te zetten.



Dit platform overstijgt de rol van een puur technisch trainingsinstrument; het is een strategische tool voor risicobeheer en cloud governance. Binnen een FinOps-cultuur, die draait om data-gedreven besluitvorming en accountability, biedt de AI Cyber Range onschatbare waarde. De meetbare verbeteringen in de prestaties van een security team – zoals een kortere 'mean time to detect' (MTTD) en 'mean time to respond' (MTTR) – zijn direct te vertalen naar een kwantificeerbare reductie van het financiële risico. Een snellere respons beperkt de potentiële schade van een aanval aanzienlijk. Bovendien stelt het organisaties in staat om aan te tonen dat zij voldoen aan strenge compliance-eisen, zoals die van de GDPR of NIS2-richtlijn. Het kunnen overleggen van bewijs van continue, realistische training kan een positieve invloed hebben op onderhandelingen over cyberverzekeringspremies en het vertrouwen van stakeholders vergroten, wat beide directe financiële voordelen oplevert.



De implementatie van de AI Cyber Range is een investering in een cultuur van proactieve verdediging en continue verbetering. De business case hiervoor is overtuigend en veelzijdig. De Return on Investment (ROI) wordt niet alleen berekend op basis van de potentieel voorkomen kosten van een datalek. Het rendement zit ook in de verhoogde operationele efficiëntie van het security operations center (SOC). Beter getrainde analisten zijn effectiever in het onderscheiden van echte dreigingen van 'false positives', wat leidt tot een efficiënter gebruik van dure security-oplossingen en een lagere werkdruk. Door vaardigheden intern te ontwikkelen en te verfijnen, vermindert de afhankelijkheid van externe, kostbare consultants tijdens een crisis. Uiteindelijk versterkt het platform de algehele financiële gezondheid van de organisatie door het cyberrisico te transformeren van een onvoorspelbare bedreiging naar een beheersbaar en meetbaar onderdeel van de bedrijfsstrategie.

Online Loan Scammers - Unregulated CBSL,"Yes as u see this. There are many campaigns i see in the recent past ok tiktok, fb, insta and so on. And some people are actually promoting this thing. Which is a big scam. In a nutshell run by one or two so called company with a fake address, fake company details and no where to be found. These guys are like ninja turtles. U can never find these scamming institutions. I have not used these services but I did a research on these scammers.

Names - CashX, oncredit, loanplus, monigo, Fino, Lotus loan. All these loan companys are super unregulated or monitored. They steal from customers scamming and threating innocent people to their trap. There customer service is worst. They hire the most rudest ppl u can ever meet. From few victims who been in this complains they are threatened and blackmailed if payments are not paid. And the so called people gain access to close contacts when youbhave the apps downloaded. never download the apps and give your privacy away. 

This must be regulated or.monitpred by CBSL. These scam company owners ere getting a godo chunk of cash scamming ppl and ruining their lives. Even during Floods. They are concern about there payments not a releif for affected customers. and this is also run by few lawyers, so suppose uou go to law. U cant do anything. 

This must stop and more of these are growing now. By the same companies promoting their fake facilities. How they manipulate u. U take 50k loan and the payment is 80k in a month or 20 days (60%). What are these called? Service fee, consultation fee, commision fee, documentation fee) instead of interest, so interest is 0 lmao. And guess what u delay payments? Late fee. And u extend the payment by paying extra. Daily 2.5% is added from the principal until u papayoff the total. How is this possible? How is the government allowing these so called institutions to run.  

This service is good if it is regualted and monitored hy CBSL. Unless not these companies bragging so much percentage of money from innocent lives. These hve been operating for years. And they also threaten people who condemn them on social media saying legal actions will be taken on people who speak against us. What are your thoughts on this? is there anyone who has taken loan from this? ",idmmybame,1peqjon,srilanka,05-12-2025,10:13:56,https://i.redd.it/wm6u0an8rc5g1.jpeg

Thoughts on this mass removed from my uterus yesterday? Hysteroscopy image in comments - described in records as 'fluffy white mass with nodularity on the posterior aspect of the uterine wall towards the fundus',"36F, height 5'7"", weight 215 lbs, former smoker, had c-section on 9/12 (12 weeks ago). I have 3 kids: 1st was vaginal, last two were cesarean. No issues noted during C-section and post partum stay in hospital either than hbp that I've had since delivery (not formerly) so taking labetalol for now 

Have experienced continuous heavy bleeding since c section. 

At around 6 weeks I had worsening excruciating cramps. OB said I had bacteria in my urine but they were unsure of origin and gave me 10 day antibiotic treatment. The extreme cramps died down, but heavy bleeding continued.

At around 10 weeks bleeding became even heavier (dark maroon filling huge pads every 1.5-2 hrs, at times every 1 hr if active). OB prescribed 10 day progesterone treatment, but the bleeding just got worse so she sent me to ER after a few days

ER did tv ultrasound and saw 1cm mass, but sent me home since blood levels were ok. They gave me IV TXA, which did nothing. My ob then prescribed me a 5 day treatment of TXA which eventually did slow the bleeding to just spotting a few days ago.

My ob then sent me to a gyno consultant who scheduled me for D&C/hysteroscopy yesterday. The surgeon was adamant before the surgery that she didn't think it was retained placenta due to negative hcg test. 

Surgeon called my husband after the procedure (since I was out of it) and said maybe it's a fibroid with some retained placenta attached to it? But that she's really still not convinced it's retained product due to negative pregnancy test. Then she said we just won't know what it is until tests come back. Could be two weeks.

This seems absurd to me - retained placenta stuck to a fibroid is basically unheard of according to my Google searches. But if it's not RPOC, then what the hell is it? It looks like necrotic tissue, no?

Any insights would be much appreciated, ty. I am impatient and scared, and now broke lol (am in the US).

⚠️Japan's Manager Visa rules have changed,"You’ll likely need a Business Manager Visa if you wish to legally scale a sole proprietorship, manage and operate a business here. Starting October 2025, Japan has made this visa much tougher to get. Here’s what’s new ⬇️ 1. The minimum investment jumped from 5 million yen to 30 million yen 💰 2. You now need to hire at least one full-time employee who’s legally resident in Japan 🇯🇵 3. The applicant must have 3+ years of management experience or a Master’s degree in relevant field 🎓 4. Either you or your employee must prove Japanese fluency 🗣️ 5. Your business plan must be verified by a certified expert like an accountant or SME consultant. 6. Home registered offices no longer count 🏢 Your application still follows the old rules if you applied before October 16, 2025. Existing visa-holders have until October 2028 to generally meet the new standards. These changes aim to reduce shell companies and ensure genuine entrepreneurs are managing real businesses, but some argue that it also raises the bar for small startups and foreign entrepreneurs. Do you think it’s a fair move to protect Japan’s economy, or an overkill for new business creation? 🔖 Save this post if you’re planning to apply or renew your visa soon and follow @gaijinpot for tips, news and content related to living and working in Japan. #gaijinpot #japan #lifeInjapan #japannews #insidejapan #livinginjapan #ilivehere #iliveinjapan #japanlife

Company refuses to employ freelancer but expect him to work like an employee,"A relative of mine is working for a european company as a contractor. He's based in Dubai and has a freelance visa/license, but he's treated like a full time employee business wise so the setup worked fine for him.

The company is now formally expanding to the Middle East and has therefore opened a mainland entity and a physical office in Dubai.
My relative asked if he could be moved over to a proper employment contract since there's no need for him to pay his own health insurance and visa costs if the company can just take that over.

To his surprise they refused and want to keep him on a contractor agreement for now. It's strange because he's been with the company for years and there haven't been any HR related issues or any other problems of that sort in the past.


What's wild is that they now asked him to come to the office regurlaly, which he is happy to do but not as a contractor.

I advised him to talk to a lawyer because surely this can't be legal, but he worries that they'll just get rid of him if he pursues any legal action.
He'd be fine with it if he was to get a severance package, and his contractor agreement does say that they have a notice period of 3 months, but he thinks since he's not legally employed he doesn't have any real leverage.


I have no idea on the legality of this situation and I adviced him to definitely consult a lawyer regardless.

But I'd be curious to know myself what his options are here, because it's a pretty strange situation.

How to choose the right Dholera consultant – expert guidance,"Buying land in Dholera Smart City has become popular lately, but choosing the **right consultant** is still the biggest challenge for most investors. Prices, zones, TP planning, and documents can get confusing fast — and one wrong step can cause long-term issues.

Here are a few things I’ve learned while researching the market and speaking with experienced investors

**1. Check if the consultant actually understands TP zones**

Most problems happen because people buy land in the wrong zone. A good consultant should clearly explain the difference between **TP zones, Non-TP areas, activation zone, village boundaries, and road connectivity**.

Several trusted voices in the market — including consultants like **Shivrajsinh Chudasama**, who often share ground-level insights — repeatedly highlight how TP clarity can save investors from big mistakes.



# 2. Look for someone who shows the real location on map + field

If a consultant only shows Google Map images or vague location screenshots, that’s a red flag.  
A reliable consultant will show:

* Exact survey numbers
* TP map location
* Village map
* Distance from activation zone
* Actual on-ground roads

Transparency matters.



**3. Ask for recent government notifications**

Dholera progress depends heavily on government TP updates and activation area changes.  
A serious consultant should be updated with:

* TP1, TP2, TP3 updates
* Final maps
* Road widening
* Industrial allocation news

If they can’t explain notifications in easy language, avoid them.



**4. Check their track record, not their marketing**

Don’t fall for fancy presentations or super-low prices. Instead look for:

* Past clients
* Clear guidance
* Document clarity
* Real-case studies
* Experience with NRI buyers

The people who give honest opinions — even if it means you *don’t* buy land — are the ones worth trusting.



**5. Avoid consultants who push only cheap land**

Cheap land usually means **non-TP, remote villages, or no future development**.  
Several market experts (again, people like *Shivrajsinh Chudasama* have also warned about this) explain that real returns come from **planned, legal, future-ready land**, not the cheapest plots.



**Conclusion**

Choosing the right consultant in Dholera is more important than choosing the land itself. A genuine advisor will explain risks before benefits, show data instead of dreams, and help you buy land that actually appreciates.

If anyone here has personal experiences — good or bad — with Dholera consultants, feel free to share. It will help many new investors make safer decisions.",Plenty_Camera4392,1peqh9p,u_Plenty_Camera4392,05-12-2025,10:09:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Plenty_Camera4392/comments/1peqh9p/how_to_choose_the_right_dholera_consultant_expert/

"MoSCoW Prioritization: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won’t Have – Getting It Right From The Start","https://preview.redd.it/0r0i7qfnpc5g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=634c249f7423e440db35a931ad938d52e4c02a6c

I was in a project review meeting last Thursday (actually it was more like a project intervention) and witnessed something I’ve seen too many times before. The Project Manager was desperately trying to explain to a roomful of increasingly frustrated stakeholders why half the transformation requirements wouldn’t make it into the initial go-live. The problem? No one had properly prioritized anything at the start. Every business process change had been labeled “critical.” Every system integration was “essential.” Every data migration activity was “urgent.”

It reminded me of that scene in The Incredibles: “When everyone’s super, no one is.” Replace “super” with “critical” and you’ve got the average requirements document.

If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. I’ve lost count of the projects I’ve seen where everything is a priority, which ultimately means nothing is a priority. It’s like going to a restaurant where every dish is the “chef’s special recommendation” – suddenly none of them are.

This is precisely where MoSCoW prioritization comes in, and why it’s one of those foundational techniques that can save your project from veering into that dreaded special measures territory.

**WHAT IS MoSCoW PRIORITIZATION?**

MoSCoW is a prioritization technique that categorizes requirements into four distinct groups, and the capital letters in the name are the clue:

**Must Have** – Non-negotiables. These are requirements that are absolutely critical to the transformation’s success. Without them, the project fails, plain and simple. In an IT transformation context, these might be core system functionality that enables critical business operations, essential integrations with existing systems, or mandatory data migrations. Think of them as the foundations of your house; you can’t build anything without them.

**Should Have** – Important but not vital. These requirements are significant and add considerable value, but the transformation can technically be delivered without them in the initial phase. Perhaps they’re process improvements that would streamline operations, or additional integrations that enhance efficiency but aren’t day-one blockers. They’re like having central heating; you really want it, but you could survive a winter without it if you absolutely had to (albeit with a lot of complaining and several extra jumpers).

**Could Have** – Nice to have. These are desirable elements that would improve the transformation outcomes or add value, but they’re not essential to achieving the core business objectives. They might be enhanced reporting capabilities, additional automation, or nice-to-have integrations with peripheral systems. Think of them as the decorative features; lovely to have, but you’d manage fine without them.

**Won’t Have (this time)** – Out of scope for this iteration. These requirements have been explicitly identified as not being delivered in the current phase, though they might be considered for future releases. Crucially, this category exists to manage expectations and prevent scope creep.

**The “o”s in MoSCoW?** They’re just there to make it pronounceable and memorable – a clever bit of acronym engineering!

**WHY MoSCoW MATTERS**

The beauty of MoSCoW lies in its simplicity and its ability to force honest conversations. Most stakeholders can grasp it immediately, and that’s powerful. You’re not asking people to understand complex scoring matrices or weighted decision models; you’re having a straightforward discussion about what truly matters.

Here’s the thing though – MoSCoW only works if you’re brave enough to have the difficult conversations. I’ve seen too many projects where the PM has categorized 80% of requirements as “Must Have” because they didn’t want to disappoint anyone. That’s not prioritization; that’s wishful thinking dressed up in methodology.

The real power emerges when you establish clear criteria for each category. At Stoneseed, we often guide our clients through defining what “Must Have” actually means for their specific context. For some, it’s about legal compliance or business continuity. For others, it’s about competitive advantage or customer commitment.

**PRACTICAL APPLICATION: MAKING MoSCoW WORK**

Let me share a recent example from a client engagement. They were undergoing a major IT transformation – consolidating multiple legacy systems into a single cloud-based enterprise platform. The initial requirements list contained 147 items. Yes, one hundred and forty-seven. I’ve seen shopping lists shorter than that. When we first reviewed it, 118 of those were marked as “essential” or “high priority.”

I’ll pause here while you do the maths. That’s 80% of requirements being absolutely critical. Apparently the other 20% were just there for a laugh.

We facilitated a series of MoSCoW workshops with the key stakeholders. Here’s what we did:

Started with the end in mind. We asked: “What does success look like at go-live?” This helped anchor the conversation in outcomes rather than features.

Applied the 60-25-10-5 rule as a guideline. Roughly 60% of requirements should be Must Have, 25% Should Have, 10% Could Have, and 5% Won’t Have. This isn’t a rigid formula, but it’s a useful sanity check. If you’ve got 90% Must Haves, you’re not doing MoSCoW prioritization – you’re doing wishful thinking with vowels.

Used the “what happens if we don’t deliver this” test. For each Must Have, we asked stakeholders to articulate the specific consequence of not including it at go-live. If the answer was vague or about future convenience rather than immediate business necessity, it probably wasn’t a Must Have. “It would be really useful” doesn’t cut it when you’re talking about a transformation go-live.

Documented the Won’t Have explicitly. By clearly stating what’s out of scope, you manage expectations and create a buffer against scope creep. It also gives stakeholders confidence that their requirements haven’t been forgotten; they’re just scheduled for a future iteration.

By the end of the workshops, we had 43 Must Haves, 52 Should Haves, 31 Could Haves, and 21 Won’t Haves. The transformation suddenly had clarity. The team knew what to focus on. The stakeholders understood the trade-offs. And crucially, when budget pressure hit mid-project (because it always does), we could intelligently descope the Could Haves and defer some Should Haves to phase two without derailing the entire initiative.

**COMMON PITFALLS AND HOW TO AVOID THEM**

Everything becomes a Must Have. This defeats the entire purpose. If stakeholders are resistant to prioritizing honestly, you need executive sponsorship to enforce the discipline. Sometimes it helps to impose a hard limit: “We can only accommodate X Must Haves given our timeline and budget. Which ones make the cut?” It’s amazing how quickly people find their inner Marie Kondo when faced with actual constraints.

Won’t Have gets forgotten. The Won’t Have category isn’t a dumping ground to be ignored; it’s a commitment to transparency. Document these items clearly and revisit them during retrospectives or planning for the next phase.

Categories are treated as fixed. Requirements can move between categories as circumstances change. A Could Have might become a Must Have if regulatory requirements shift or business priorities change mid-transformation. A Should Have might drop to Won’t Have if budget gets cut or timelines compress. The categories should reflect current reality, not historical classification.

Insufficient stakeholder involvement. MoSCoW needs buy-in from people with the authority to make trade-offs. In IT transformations, this means engaging business leaders, not just IT teams. If you’re prioritizing in isolation or only with the technical delivery team, you’ll end up with technically-focused categories that don’t reflect business priorities or the realities of organizational change.

**THE VALUE OF EXPERIENCED PROJECT RESOURCES**

This is where having the right project management resources makes all the difference. Facilitating effective MoSCoW prioritization isn’t just about knowing the technique – it’s about having the experience and credibility to have those difficult conversations with stakeholders, to push back when everything’s being labeled “critical,” and to guide teams toward realistic, achievable outcomes.

[At Stoneseed, our Project Management as a Service (PMaaS) model](https://www.stoneseed.co.uk/project-management-as-a-service) gives you access to experienced PM professionals who’ve been through this hundreds of times before. They’re not learning on your transformation project; they’re bringing battle-tested expertise that helps you avoid the common pitfalls and navigate the politics of prioritization with confidence.

Whether you need someone to facilitate your MoSCoW workshops, provide interim programme leadership during a critical transformation phase, or embed within your PMO to strengthen governance and delivery capability across multiple workstreams, our flexible resourcing model means you get the right expertise exactly when you need it – without the overhead of permanent hires or the risks of lengthy recruitment cycles.

**BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER**

That project review meeting I mentioned at the beginning? After implementing proper MoSCoW prioritization with one of our experienced consultants facilitating, the same client successfully delivered their transformation go-live on time and within budget. The stakeholders were happier because expectations had been managed properly from the start. The delivery team was more focused because they weren’t constantly being pulled in different directions by competing “critical” requirements.

MoSCoW won’t magically solve every transformation challenge – no single technique will – but it provides a foundation for the kind of honest, productive conversations that lead to successful delivery. Combined with strong leadership, clear governance, and the right resource flexibility, it’s a powerful tool in any Project Manager’s toolkit.

Whether you’re navigating a complex IT transformation, managing changing business requirements, dealing with budget pressures, or balancing competing stakeholder demands, MoSCoW provides that clarity to keep your project on course. Like any good technique, it’s simple to understand but requires discipline to apply well.

And that discipline? That’s what separates projects that struggle from projects that succeed.

* Clinic Name: VAVA Plastic Surgery
* Procedure(s): e.g. Rhinoplasty (Silicon bridge implant, columella lowering, nostril lowering, bulbous nose tip correction, tiplasty with autologous rib cartilage graft, alar reduction)
* Price Quoted: ₩11,110,000 (incl. VAT)
* Price Paid: ₩10,000,000 (incl. VAT)
* Date of Consultation: Aug 1, 2025 (KakaoTalk); Sep 30, 2025 (In-person)
* Date of Procedure: Nov 6, 2025
* Disclaimer: I asked the clinic if they offered any support for patients who are willing to share their healing progress publicly so others can better understand the real experience. They provided a discount for documenting my 1-month and 3-month updates.

Hi everyone, I'm a month post-op and wanted to share my experience with VAVA Plastic Surgery.

How I found and decided on VAVA:

I used Gangnam UNNI to find clinics through review photos and then did general searches on those clinics on purseforum, Youtube, Reddit etc. to get more information on the clinics. Initially the search was disappointing, nearly every doctor would have a mix of good and bad results but I didn't want to play russian roulette with my nose. After going down a rabbit hole, I found VAVA. Dr. Cho was the only doctor I found on UNNI whose before and afters were vast improvements. I felt like they were almost too good to be true, like he was an absolute artist.

VAVA is a relatively new clinic and there wasn't much information on them online so I really took a leap of faith, in a sense. What really sold me on VAVA was actually this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM8tSdKfU2k) where the doctor goes into detail on what makes a good nose. A lot of doctors mention the ideal angle of the tip and the height of the bridge, basically the makings of the sillhouette of a nice nose from the side, but rarely in so much detail like the angle of the nostrils or the height of the columella. I felt like my vision of a good nose really aligned with Dr. Cho's, and so I felt like he was ""the one"".

Interactions with the clinic staff and doctor:

I reached out for an online consultation through KakaoTalk. The online consultation was very thorough with diagrams, arrows and text edited onto the photos. 

The interpreter who I'd been speaking to over Kakao was with me on surgery day as well. She was there to walk me through surgery prep, stayed through the surgery and was there to make sure I left safely with my sister. She was extremely helpful and thorough, and she even ordered a whole box of pumpkin juice to my hotel!

If you want a doctor who is extremely sweet and kind, Dr. Cho is probably not the one. My interactions with him were focused and intentional, no-frills. He carries himself confidently and gives off the vibes of a perfectionist, which could come off as cold but I didn't mind. I figured that a confident perfectionist would want good results even more than I would for myself. In a way, his confidence was assuring and his B/As definitely speak for themselves. The fact that it was a newer clinic **and** he wasn't pandering to me or trying really hard to get my business made it easier for me to trust him.

The surgery went smoothly and took about 2 hours. One minute I was lying in the OR and the next, I was opening my eyes in the recovery room. I felt really woozy but not nauseous. The interpreter told me that I could take my time to rest in the recovery room until I felt well enough to leave but I wanted to go back to my hotel ASAP so I tried to snap back quickly. I went to the bathroom and turned on the bidet but without my glasses, I couldn't figure out how to turn it off so I ended up spraying myself and a staff member with bidet water... but luckily, everyone was so nice about it!!

Results:

I'm SO happy with the results. I think it really was the best case scenario for my nose. From the side, I think the height and projection balances out my chin, which is completely natural despite looking like a bad implant. He managed to deliver on every promise while maintaining facial harmony. My only gripe is the swelling between my eyes which pull them closer together and make me look extra fake, but I know that will go away in time so it doesn't bother me much. I notice some asymmetry but my face, including my nose, has always been asymmetrical. I wouldn't want my nose to be the only symmetrical thing on my face - that would look too unnatural. I think of it like hanging a picture next to a slanted door frame. Slanting the picture actually makes it look ""right"". Additionally, I don't actually notice the asymmetry in real life and neither does anyone I've asked so it might be more of a zoom-and-scrutinize sort of issue. The lower part of my nose is everything I wanted - rounded nostrils with a more defined and lower tip. I may have paid a little more than other clinics are quoting but I truly believe no other doctor that I found could have delivered results with such attention to detail.",Eastern-Ad3157,1peqbgj,SeoulPlasticSurgery,05-12-2025,09:59:29,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1peqbgj
I feel like I don’t have control anymore,"TW; STI, mentions of SH, Self Hatred

I’m sorry if this is long. I just needed to vent and I don’t feel comfortable telling anyone that knows me, including my psychologist. I don’t care much if no one reads this, it just takes a weight off of my chest, if only just slightly.

Here’s the backstory of why I have spiraled the way I have;
I (early 20’s F) have a partner (mid 20’s M), we have been going strong for over 3 years now, and I’ve never felt so confident in a relationship before (I have endured awful things from previous romantic relationships) until recently. We live across the Atlantic from each other, me in Europe and him in North America, but I come to visit him as often as I can. We have intimacy as most couples do, but he has never wanted to use a condom (I have a birth control implant if that is relevant at all) as he says it “removes a lot of the feeling”. I have always preferred condoms as I feel safer with them but I’m too much of a people pleaser and have a very difficult time saying no, and I regret it so much now.

Well, last time I visited (last week) my private area started “burning”, I thought nothing of it as it wasn’t too bad, maybe we were too rough? I consulted a family member of his that had been a nurse for 30 years, and she said to keep the area clean and helped me to the best of her ability.
But then after 2 nights I wake up in such pain I can only scream and cry. This woke my boyfriend up, panicked. He took me to the shower as he thought warm water would help the pain, but all I could do was sit/lie in the shower in a fetal position and cry and scream from pain. He got into the shower with me and held and comforted me. I remember feeling blisters/small bumps in my genital region, which hurt to hell and back when touched. Most of what happened next is a big blur, including the travel back to my country, as I was mentally dissociated from the pain I endured.
The same day I arrived in my country I immediately contact my local health center as I’m on my way home (I didn’t do that in the U.S as I am terrified of hospital bills there without insurance) and got an appointment the same day.

By the time I get to the appointment, the pain is mostly gone. I tell the doctor this and she examines me, saying that it seems like the blisters had “exploded” and that is why I didn’t feel as much pain anymore. After tests done, I got the diagnosis HPV-1. I felt myself crumble. My boyfriend gave me herpes. We had been intimate many times during the 3 years, and neither of us have had any sexual/romantic contact while we’ve been apart from each other. His previous girlfriend had slept with many MANY people, and he most likely caught it from her but remained symptom-free. He is gonna get tested and get the results back by next week. After I told him, crying my eyes out, he also started to cry. He blames himself for putting me through that excruciating pain and will never forgive himself for what he did to me, he told me that “not knowing” was not an excuse to him.
I’ve done research about herpes, and while it isn’t as bad as I initially thought, I still need to change my lifestyle in a way, and that crushes me.

TL;DR boyfriend (unknowingly) gave me herpes that he hadn’t shown any signs of.

Now to the part that makes me almost be unable to sleep at night and can’t function because of this entire situation.
I feel like my control of my own body and life has been removed. I’ve started washing my hands after touching my own skin and drowned them in hand sanitizer; I’m terrified of spreading it. I haven’t been able to eat, nor have I wanted to because that feels like the one control I have right now, controlling when to eat. I told one of my friends that I had excruciating pain after arriving back in my country, and she told me to keep her updated as she is worried, but now I just feel ashamed. Same thing with my parents. I live with them as I study, and it was my father that drove me to the health center as it hurt too much for me to use my legs to drive. I have not told them yet, and I am scared for when they are gonna start pressuring me to tell them (they are good at that).

Even though herpes is not as bad as I thought, it consumes my thoughts and it’s making me spiral back into self-harming behavior that I used to indulge in many years ago.

"Gross Misconduct Investigation and Disciplinary Timeline: 10 weeks suspended, 18 days post-hearing. Is this delay normal?","Hi everyone,

I am looking for some perspective on a disciplinary process I am currently going through. 

I work in a safety-critical role in the aviation industry (UK-based).

I am currently suspended pending the outcome of a disciplinary hearing, but the timeline seems to be dragging on, and the anxiety is building. 

I wanted to ask the community if this duration is standard or if it suggests a specific internal issue.

The Context:
Tenure: Less than 1 year, but passed probation successfully prior to the incident.

Allegation: Gross Misconduct. Specifically, throwing an empty paper carton/bottle at a colleague in a galley area (admitted to the act, but maintained it was a ""playful"" lapse in judgment rather than malice) and alleged ""belittling"" verbal comments. I also said catch while passing the bottle. 

Mitigation: Immediate apology at the time; admitted the physical act during investigation; Union Rep argued that the Line Manager allowed me to work the safety-critical return leg after the incident was reported, suggesting I was not viewed as an immediate threat at the time.

The Timeline:
17th Sept: Incident occurred on outbound duty.
18th Sept: I was allowed to work the inbound duty (return leg) by management despite the complaint being raised.
28th Sept: I was formally suspended.
29th Sept: Investigation meeting held.
Mid-Oct: Investigation report issued (Recommended ""Case to Answer"").
17th Nov: Disciplinary Hearing held. The hearing manager stated she would not let the investigation report influence her and would make her own independent decision.
5th Dec (Today): Still no outcome received.

My Question:
It has now been 18 days since the disciplinary hearing and over 10 weeks since I was suspended.

Given that I admitted to the physical act (throwing the empty carton), I assumed this would be a ""slam dunk"" decision for HR if they wanted to dismiss me.

Does a delay of nearly 3 weeks post-hearing usually indicate:
A backlog in HR?
That they are consulting legal/ER because the decision is borderline (dismissal vs. final warning)?
That the procedural inconsistency (allowing me to work the return leg) has complicated the ability to dismiss for Gross Misconduct?

Any insights on whether this timeline is standard would be appreciated.",Rockbmi,1peq89y,AskHRUK,05-12-2025,09:53:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHRUK/comments/1peq89y/gross_misconduct_investigation_and_disciplinary/

Validating a SaaS idea: AI-powered startup idea generator with founder attempt data,"https://preview.redd.it/mtpr5evvic5g1.jpg?width=1168&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e4c619246c9491244a179294753a635889d0d21

Building a tool for SaaS founders who want to find their next idea or validate current ones.



\*\*The problem with existing idea generators:\*\*

\- Random combinations with no market validation

\- No data on whether ideas are viable

\- No signal of founder interest/attempts



\*\*My approach:\*\*

\- Problem-first: Start with real pain points

\- Collision engine: Match problems with emerging tech

\- Validation layer: Show founders who already built similar products

  \- Their traction (MRR, funding, users)

  \- What worked/failed

  \- Links to their stories



\*\*Go-to-market:\*\*

\- Freemium: 3 ideas/day free

\- Pro: $15/mo for unlimited + deep analysis

\- B2B: $500 workshops for corporate innovation teams

\- White-label: $3K/year for consultants/accelerators



\*\*Target:\*\* UAE/MENA first (I'm based in Dubai), then expand.



\*\*Questions for SaaS folks:\*\*

1. Would you pay $15/mo for this?

2. What features would make it essential vs. nice-to-have?

3. Is founder attempt data actually valuable or just ""neat""?

"Heater stopped working, 14° F outside, I have an idea of what it could be & just curious if I should contact landlord?","The heater has been working perfectly fine but I came home from work yesterday and tried to turn up the heat only for it to completely stop working (thermostat won’t turn on and is flashing low battery) I changed the batteries and that still didn’t work, so I went downstairs to the furnace and turned off the switch, waited 1 minute, and then turned it back on, still nothing. Next step is to go out to the breaker box and look to see if there’s one labeled “furnace” “heating” “hvac” but with very limited to no electrical knowledge, I’m not sure it’s safe for me to be opening the breaker box and flipping any switches without consulting professionals

Facial Fat Grafting – Explanation from a Clinic Perspective,"Facial fat grafting is a procedure that uses your own fat to restore volume and reshape the face. Many patients consider it when under-eye hollowness, flat cheeks, or deep folds make the face appear tired or aged. Since the fat comes from your own body, the results look and feel natural, and the tissue can remain long-term once it successfully stabilizes.

The procedure begins by collecting fat from an area with enough volume. The inner thigh or lower abdomen are common donor sites. A very small incision is used to harvest the fat, and once it heals, it is often difficult to notice. After harvesting, the fat is cleaned and prepared. This step removes fluid and damaged cells so that only healthy fat is injected.

The prepared fat is then introduced into the face through very fine cannulas. Instead of “one large injection,” the fat is placed in many small amounts at different levels. This technique creates a smooth transition and prevents unevenness. It also allows the surgeon to shape the face thoughtfully, whether the goal is stronger mid-face volume, softer folds, or improvement in hollow areas.

Recovery is similar to most small-incision procedures. Swelling and bruising are expected, especially in the first few days, but they gradually improve. Over time, some of the fat becomes permanent living tissue. Because of this, fat grafting can be a longer-lasting option compared to fillers. The degree of retention varies from person to person, so some patients choose a second session to refine the result once the first stage has stabilized.

Scarring from facial fat grafting is minimal. The harvesting incision is small and placed in a discreet area, and the entry points on the face are tiny punctures that fade as healing progresses. When fully healed, they are usually difficult to find unless you are looking closely.

For individuals hoping to create a more balanced, refreshed, or youthful appearance, fat grafting can be an effective approach. It is not meant to replace every other method, but it offers advantages when structural volume loss is the concern. A consultation is always important, because the result depends on facial anatomy, skin condition, and the volume needed.

If you have questions about candidacy, recovery, or timing, we are happy to give general guidance here. More specific recommendations are best made after meeting in person and examining the face directly.",Square_Repair_4840,1pepsza,SeoulPlasticSurgery,05-12-2025,09:25:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeoulPlasticSurgery/comments/1pepsza/facial_fat_grafting_explanation_from_a_clinic/

Call Center Business Continuity Plan: The Thing You Only Notice When It’s Too Late,"Let’s be honest: most call centers treat “business continuity plan” as an audit requirement, not an operational must-have.  
But if your phone system, CRM, or primary site went down for 2 hours right now, would you have a clear, tested plan… or just a frantic Slack thread?

Here’s the straight-up breakdown of what a real call center BCP needs to cover (without the consultant buzzwords).

# 1. What “business continuity” actually means in a call center

At a basic level, your business continuity plan answers one question:  
“How do we keep serving customers when critical systems, locations, or people go offline?”​

That includes:

* Telephony going down (carrier issues, infra failures).
* CRM/helpdesk outages.
* Network problems or power failures at a site.
* Sudden agent shortages (weather, health, local events).
* Security incidents or data issues that force you to shut something off.​

If your plan doesn’t clearly spell out what happens in each of those scenarios, it’s not continuity. It’s wishful thinking.

# 2. Step one: map the risks and impact

Before you write a single “procedure,” you need a simple risk and impact map.​

Ask:

* What can realistically break? (tools, locations, vendors, teams)
* How long can each be down before customers, clients, or regulators feel it?
* Which processes are mission-critical vs “can wait a day”?​

Typical buckets:

* **Infra & tech:** telephony, internet, cloud provider, CRM, ticketing.
* **People:** agent availability, leadership, key admins and IT owners.
* **Data & security:** breaches, ransomware, accidental deletions.
* **External factors:** natural disasters, political events, vendor failures.​

This gives you a prioritized list of “if X breaks, Y hurts first.”

# 3. Redundancy: designing for “when,” not “if”

Continuity is mostly decided by what you set up *before* anything breaks.​

Think in layers:

* **Telephony redundancy:** backup carriers, alternate numbers, routing rules you can flip fast.
* **System redundancy:** backup workflows if CRM/helpdesk is down (temporary tools, exports, or lightweight fallbacks).
* **Data redundancy:** regular backups, clear RTO/RPO (how fast you recover and how much data loss is acceptable).​

If your fallback during an outage is “we’ll just use spreadsheets and hope,” you’ll feel it in SLAs and CSAT.

# 4. Playbooks, not just policies

A good BCP reads more like a runbook than a policy doc.​

For each major scenario, define:

* Trigger: How do you know this mode should be activated?
* Owner: who declares “we’re in BCP mode” and who leads the response?
* Steps: concrete actions for ops, IT, supervisors, and agents.
* Exit criteria: when and how you revert to normal operations.​

Examples:

* Telephony outage: switch inbound to backup number/provider + redirect to alternate site/channel + push proactive customer messaging.
* CRM outage: fallback logging method + essential data fields only + later sync once systems are back.​

Everyone should know where these playbooks live and how to access them during an incident.

# 5. Communication during disruption

In a real incident, confusion wastes more time than the outage itself.​

You need clear communication paths for:

* Internal: how you inform agents, supervisors, IT, leadership, and client POCs.
* External: what you tell customers about impact, timelines, and alternate channels (chat, email, self-service).​

Basics that help:

* Pre-approved message templates for common scenarios.
* A simple escalation tree (who informs whom, in what order).
* One source of truth for updates (not 10 conflicting threads).​

If agents find out from customers that something’s broken, the plan is already failing.

# 6. CX, compliance, and data: don’t go blind

Continuity isn’t only about “are we reachable?” It’s also:

* Are we still capturing what’s happening on calls?
* Can we still prove what happened later (for audits or disputes)?
* Can we still coach and improve based on those conversations?​

This is where tools like Convin quietly become part of the BCP fabric:

* Recording and analyzing conversations even when you change routing, sites, or workflows.
* Keeping transcripts and key interaction data centralized for QA and compliance.
* Surfacing issues that emerge *because* of the disruption (spikes in complaints, confusion, misinformation).​

You don’t want an incident to create a big “black hole” in your conversation history.

# 7. Training, drills, and making BCP real

A continuity plan that only lives in a PDF will not survive first contact with reality.​

Make it real by:

* Training supervisors and agents on “BCP mode” as part of onboarding.
* Running periodic drills (short, focused simulations) for your top scenarios.
* Reviewing what worked/failed after each drill or real incident and updating playbooks.​

Over time, the goal is simple: when something breaks, the team switches modes like muscle memory, not panic.

"20F • Traumatic childhood • Abusive parents • Childhood assault ignored • Worked since 15 • Falling apart • Confused, tired, but still fighting — What should I do with my life now?","Hi Reddit,
I’m 20F from Mumbai, and I feel like I’ve lived a lifetime already. I’m posting here because I genuinely need guidance about my career, education, and life direction. I have no one in real life to guide me, and I feel completely lost.


---

Background & Struggles

I grew up in an abusive household. My parents were controlling, dismissive, and emotionally harsh.

I was sexually assaulted as a child, and when I told my parents after 10th grade, they didn’t support me. My father didn’t back me up, and they expected me to just survive, go abroad, earn, and get married like my elder sister did.

Sometimes there wasn’t enough food, sometimes I felt invisible.



---

Education & Dreams

I scored 95% in SSC, but after 10th, my parents didn’t let me pursue my dreams seriously. I wanted to be a pilot, then an airhostess, and even wanted to pursue CA, but they stopped me, saying “Kab tak padhegi?”

I completed my 12th with 64% under the circumstances and recently finished my TYBAF degree this year.

Despite everything, I’ve always tried to fight for my dreams.



---

Work Experience

I’ve been working since 17 to support myself and my family:

School Teacher (2 years)

Sports Leader at Decathlon

Claims Process at JPMC (over a year)

Fashion Consultant at Anaar (retail)


Every job has been about survival, not passion. I’m capable, creative, and hardworking, but I don’t know what career path makes sense for me long-term.


---

Current Thoughts & Goals

I want to rebuild my life and finally focus on my own future.

I’m thinking about pursuing an MBA or Master’s abroad, possibly with a loan.

I want stability, independence, and a career I can grow in.

I also want to work on health, routine, and mental recovery, but I don’t know which to prioritize.

Questions for Reddit

I need practical advice from people with experience:

1. Should I focus first on health, skills, or studies abroad?


2. How realistic is it for someone in my situation to pursue MBA/Master’s abroad with a loan?


3. What career paths fit my background (Commerce/Finance, teaching, customer service, retail, claims)?


4. How do I finally start building a life for myself, after years of surviving and putting others first?



I’m tired of just surviving. I want to fight for myself now, but I feel lost. Any honest, practical guidance would mean the world.",kkkkkkkk12345678900,1pepobt,LifeAdvice,05-12-2025,09:16:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1pepobt/20f_traumatic_childhood_abusive_parents_childhood/
"20F • Traumatic childhood • Abusive parents • Childhood assault ignored • Worked since 15 • Falling apart • Confused, tired, but still fighting — What should I do with my life now?","
Hi Reddit,
I don’t usually share my life like this, but I really need guidance. I’m 20F, from Mumbai, and I feel like I’ve carried the weight of a lifetime already. I’ve been surviving, but now I’m trying to figure out how to actually live.

Childhood & Family

I grew up in an abusive household. My parents were controlling, emotionally harsh, and very dismissive. There was no safety, no comfort, no love.

I was sexually assaulted as a child, and when I finally told my parents after 10th grade… they didn’t protect me. They didn’t even acknowledge what happened properly. My father didn’t back me up at all.

There were times I struggled to eat. There were times I just felt invisible, like my pain didn’t matter.

After 10th, when I broke down and shared my trauma, my parents basically told me they didn’t care about my dreams — they wanted me to go to Dubai, earn, and get married, just like my elder sister had sacrificed her life.


Education & Dreams

Despite everything, I always loved studying. I scored 95% in SSC. I dreamed of flying — I wanted to be a pilot. When that didn’t seem possible, I aimed to be an airhostess. I even wanted to pursue CA, but my parents kept saying, “Kab tak padhegi?” and never let me appear for exams.

I fought anyway. I did my 12th with 64%, knowing I had so much against me. I completed my TYBAF this year, mostly on my own.

But every dream I had was crushed by my parents’ pressure or indifference. I’ve had to grow up fast, live as a survivor, and keep going.

Work Experience

I’ve been working since I was 17 to support my family:

School Teacher (2 years)

Sports Leader at Decathlon

Claims Process at JPMorgan Chase (over a year)

Now a Fashion Consultant at Anaar (retail)


Every job has been about survival, not passion. I’ve learned a lot, but I still feel stuck and unsure what I want long-term.


Health & Daily Struggles

My health is suffering:

PCOS

Insulin resistance

Hair fall, acne, fatigue

Continuous bleeding for days

Weight: 93 kg, 5’7”


I’ve tried dieting, workouts, glow-up routines — but trauma, stress, and exhaustion keep pulling me back.


Current Thoughts

I want to break free from my past and build a life of my own. I’m thinking:

MBA or Master’s abroad, possibly with a loan

Focus on career, stability, and independence

Heal my body and mind

Actually live for myself instead of just surviving


I don’t know if I should focus on health first, skills first, or go straight for studies abroad. I feel completely lost.


Why I’m Posting?

I don’t have anyone to guide me. I want honest, practical advice:

What should I focus on first — health, career, or studies abroad?

How can I rebuild my life after trauma and parental pressure?

Is pursuing an MBA/Master’s abroad realistic for someone like me?

How do I finally start living the life I’ve dreamed of?


I’m tired of just surviving. I want to fight for myself now, but I don’t know which way to go.

Please, be honest. No sugarcoating. I need reality.

I have good extra curricular background with case comp wins, sport wins and debating wins but don't have a PoR as of right now. I want to know about two things:

1) What calls should I expect? And is it worth to accept any calls as of right now? Or should take work ex and prepare for CAT after 2 years?

2) Is there any problem in giving CAT twice or thrice in GDPI interviews?

[Online][PBP][Dnd 5e 2014][Lgbtq+][Players] The Sleeping City,"Hi there! I’m a DM that’s been playing for around 9 years now and wanted to run a text based homebrew campaign. Most of it is going to be done through a discord server, with light combat and rolls. Its ment to feel and play like an indie text based RPG game, just with live people.

This specifc campaign is open to anyone that wants to play. It is an 18 and up campaign, and yes I can tell if you are under 18 or not.

A couple things to knock out of the way first. This is a Play By Post campaign. Which means it's text based and moves far slower than a normal campaign. It's closer to a regular roleplay with DND rules than just strictly DND. I've had people take months just to buy something in a store because life happens and not everyone can respond rapid fire once its their turn. We understand that unexpected things can occur but if your ok and just sitting there twiddling thumbs in the server you will be skipped over. 

This campagin is also based off of what everyone is ok with. So if someone says they aren't comfortable with excessive gore, there won't be excessive gore. That said it can get dark even with restrictions on. Password is luna. Expect horror elements along with the magic, fantasy, and flying pigs. There are also traumatic backstories with mentions of torture, racism, slavery, talk of war, improper medicine usage, plagues, clowns, mannequins, sociopathic NPCs, character death, various mental health issues, body horror, medical malpractice, mirrors, uncanny valley, time shenanigans, and a bunch of other stuff I am either forgetting or cant mention due to how graphic it is. Most of it is background stuff that can be worked around if someone has a genuine problem with it but it is there if not otherwise specified.

You will be asked more than once if you are ok with something. If you chose to keep quiet and not mention anything, until it pops up in the campagin and then have a problem with it? There will be no sympathy for you. You can also directly ask me questions about the campagin and I am happy to answer any that dont spoil the ending. I am willing to work around what your not comfortable with. That being said things cant be worked around if you dont say anything. 

There are only three requirements to join this campagin. 

1) do not be needlessly rude to other players or the DM. This means harassing people in their DMs, throwing slurs, screaming profanities, and pretty much anything that you wouldnt do in public. This is a fantasy game that I use to escape being screamed at, I dont want it in my campagin.

2) be over 18. Simple as that.

3) send more than just a single sentence response that has no feeling to it. Your responses dont have to be the best, but you need to give me and others something to work with. 


With that said let's get into the intro.


“Welcome to Urania, where nothing is as it seems.

Run around with a colorful cast of characters as you try to piece together the mystery of the lost city. Consult with other powers, earn favors, aquire strange relics, and fight gods all across the seven isles. 

From the depths of the Moonlight Meadows catacombs, to the dusty monastery at the tops of starlite peak, all the way down to a forgotten carnival. You will make friends, meet enemies, and wonder who that strange person appearing everywhere you go is. 


Remember that Chaos has its eyes on you.”


If this interests you then please fill out the form bellow. Not all applicants will be accepted as it's a 6 player maximum campaign. But I will be going over all responses and selecting who I think fits the campaign the best. I will close and make my final selection in 1 week after this is posted. Thank you for your time players!

Rivastigmine Patch Shortages Again? A Potential Tailwind for Zunveyl.,"
The UK just issued another high-impact shortage alert for rivastigmine patches. Not one brand — multiple brands, multiple strengths. Back in July, a different patch brand went short. Now the backups are running short too. That’s starting to look like a real pattern.

So why pay attention?

Because this “Europe cracks first → US feels it later” scenario isn’t new. We’ve watched it play out with other drugs:

• ADHD meds: UK/EU shortages in late 2022 → US shortages in early 2023
• GLP-1s: Europe reported tight supply 2021–2022 → US shortages hit in 2023
• Levothyroxine: EU manufacturing issue in 2017 → US tightening through 2018–2019

Same global manufacturers, same APIs, same production lines. When one region gets squeezed, another usually feels it next.
Any instability here would force switches, usually permanently.

The bigger potential tail wind for ACI? Payers hate drug shortages. They create emergency overrides, non-formulary exceptions, therapy gaps, behavioral flare-ups, falls, and avoidable medical costs. It’s expensive, disruptive, and makes PBMs look unprepared.

So when Michael sits down with the next payer, he has a new angle:

""Your preferred rivastigmine products are showing global instability. Zunveyl is a stable alternative that avoids forced switches and protects continuity of care.""

And if a similar shortage ever hits the US, the entire dynamic could shift quickly — with consultant pharmacists and LTC facilities moving toward the one option that doesn’t disappear mid-month.",Mobile-Dish-4497,1peph4w,AlphaCognition,05-12-2025,09:03:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlphaCognition/comments/1peph4w/rivastigmine_patch_shortages_again_a_potential/
Isotretinoin resistance,"I am a 24-year-old male (177 cm, 66 kg). I have been suffering from excessive sebum production since August of this year.
For the past two years, I had been taking Isotretinoin (5 mg/day) to manage my oily skin, and it was successfully controlling the sebum. However, since August, the production suddenly became uncontrollable. I continued to increase the dosage and am currently taking 65 mg/day. Even at this dosage, the sebum production has not significantly decreased.
Suspecting an abnormality, I visited a dermatologist and underwent blood tests, but my DHEA-S and thyroid function levels were normal. I was told that since there are no systemic physical issues, nothing more can be done. However, my face has turned a dark reddish color due to irritation from the sebum, and this condition is causing me daily distress.
I also started taking Dutasteride (0.5 mg) last week to target the sebum, but I have not seen any improvement yet. Are there any other potential treatments available, or specific medical departments I should consult?

As a possible contributing factor, I was taking supplements—specifically Tongkat Ali and Speman—from April to October of this year. In retrospect, I realize I should have discontinued them sooner.
However, even if these supplements were the underlying cause, I find it difficult to believe that they would trigger such an intense surge in sebum production that it completely overrides the efficacy of high-dose Isotretinoin.",Cheap_Initiative1849,1pepgzk,AcneTreatments,05-12-2025,09:03:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcneTreatments/comments/1pepgzk/isotretinoin_resistance/

Understanding Grease Compatibility: A Guide to Smooth Operations,"Grease compatibility is a critical factor in maintaining the performance and reliability of mechanical systems. Improperly mixing grease can lead to equipment failure, increased maintenance costs, and reduced operational efficiency. This blog delves into the fundamentals of grease compatibility, its importance, challenges, and best practices for ensuring optimal performance.

 

https://preview.redd.it/ff3myuuhec5g1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d28463b6816bd588c910b54077296da03b94ca5

  
The Basis for Grease Compatibility

Grease is a combination of base oil, thickener, and additives. Compatibility between greases depends on the interactions between these components:

 

Base Oil Compatibility  
Base oils, either mineral or synthetic, form the primary lubricating medium in grease. Mixing greases with incompatible base oils can cause phase separation, reduced lubricity, and degradation of the grease’s properties. For example, mixing mineral oil-based grease with synthetic oil-based grease may lead to viscosity changes or chemical instability.

 

Thickener CompatibilityThickeners provide the semi-solid structure of grease. Common types include lithium, calcium, polyurea, and aluminum complex. Mixing incompatible thickeners may cause grease to soften, harden, or even lose its structural integrity. For instance, lithium and polyurea thickeners are generally incompatible.

 

Additive CompatibilityAdditives enhance grease performance by providing properties like corrosion resistance, extreme pressure tolerance, or anti-wear characteristics. Incompatible additives can neutralize each other’s effects or create harmful reactions that degrade the grease’s performance.  
  

 

Categories of CompatibilitySeveral methods are used to evaluate grease compatibility:

 

Dropping Point TestThis test measures the temperature at which grease transitions from a semi-solid to a liquid state. Mixing incompatible greases can alter the dropping point, leading to performance issues in high-temperature applications.

 

Worked Penetration Test This test assesses the consistency of grease after it has been mechanically worked, simulating actual use conditions. Significant changes in consistency may indicate incompatibility, which can result in improper lubrication.

 

Four-Ball Wear TestThis test evaluates the anti-wear properties of grease under load conditions. It provides insight into how well mixed greases can protect surfaces from wear. Incompatibility often leads to increased wear rates.

 

Oil Separation TestThis test measures the tendency of oil to separate from the thickener in mixed greases. Excessive separation can compromise lubrication and lead to equipment failure.  
  
By conducting these tests, you can identify potential issues before mixed greases are applied in critical systems.  


 

Challenges of Grease Compatibility 

Lack of Standardization Grease formulations vary widely among manufacturers, making compatibility difficult to predict. Even greases labeled as similar can behave differently when mixed.

 

Field Conditions Operational environments, such as extreme temperatures, high pressures, and contamination, can exacerbate compatibility issues, leading to unpredictable performance.

 

Limited InformationOEMs and suppliers may not always provide detailed compatibility data, leaving end-users to rely on testing or experience to determine compatibility.  
 

 

How to Minimize Mixing Effects

Standardize GreasesWherever possible, use the same type of grease across similar equipment to eliminate compatibility concerns. This also simplifies inventory management.

 

Consult OEM RecommendationsFollow the manufacturer’s guidance on recommended greases for specific equipment. OEMs typically specify greases that are tested and approved for their systems.

 

Flush and CleanWhen switching grease, thoroughly clean and flush the equipment to remove residual grease. This minimizes the risk of mixing incompatible greases.

 

Conduct Compatibility TestsBefore introducing a new grease, perform compatibility tests under controlled conditions to ensure it will perform reliably when mixed with existing greases.

 

Maintain RecordsKeep detailed records of the grease used in each piece of equipment. This information is invaluable for troubleshooting and avoiding accidental mixing.  


 

ConclusionUnderstanding grease compatibility is essential for maintaining equipment reliability and performance. By considering the compatibility of base oils, thickeners, and additives, you can prevent costly failures and extend the life of your machinery. Regular testing, adherence to OEM recommendations, and proactive maintenance practices are key to minimizing the risks associated with grease mixing. Remember, a little attention to grease compatibility goes a long way in ensuring smooth operations and cost efficiency.

Stbx spouse changed the locks on me,Hi! I am in the middle of divorce proceedings with my soon to be ex. On Thanksgiving he started a huge argument with me (I got a good bit of it recorded) where he was incredibly hostile raising his voice and slamming his hand on the table next to me. During the argument he told me that he intended to make life as miserable as possible if I stayed in the house and threatened to take my pets from me. That night I locked myself in my room and packed as much as I could and moved out the next morning while he was at work. I took 3 out of 4 pets with me (he has the 4th because he was holding her hostage in his truck overnight). I still have a LOT of belongings in the house. I tried to stop in Monday while he was at work to grab some things and he had changed the locks on me without notifying me. I filed a police report and was told I can break in and I did so (without causing damage). He is now telling me he wants me to remove my things by the end of this month. He has not yet bought me out or secured financing to do so. He is also still holding the other dog hostage (she was the only pet bought during the marriage but was bought as a birthday gift for me). We had our court date for uncontested divorce yesterday (which has since changed to contested because he decided he wants to take my dog all of the sudden). We are supposed to meet with mediation sometime in the near future and I am going to be consulting with an attorney within the next week. I am mostly curious if there is anything I can do about the changed locks in the meantime.  And if my dog happens to be in the house when I stop by would it be illegal for me to take her with me? Can he legally tell me to remove the rest of my belongings when I still co own the house? And what can I do if he throws out my things? ,Spirited_Intern_8629,1pepdn1,Divorce,05-12-2025,08:57:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1pepdn1/stbx_spouse_changed_the_locks_on_me/
National Authority for Global Syrian Expertise,"Hey everyone,

I saw this post and here’s a quick summary:

A consultant in the Ministry of Telecommunications in Syria said:

The hardest challenge has been getting Syrian experts abroad to help.

We have thousands of highly skilled Syrians working all over the world, but bringing them back (or even involving them remotely) is really difficult. Imagine someone earning $10k $20k a month abroad… while local salaries are $500–$800. It just doesn’t match.

* What we really need is:
* a real budget for hiring experts
*  clear, professional evaluations
* and most importantly: a work environment that respects their expertise and gives them real decision-making power



No country can improve without using its best minds. That’s why I really like the idea people suggested:



**“National Authority for Global Syrian Expertise**” a hub/platform that brings together all Syrian experts around the world, organized by specialization, so they can contribute even if they can’t return right now.



So what can we do to help make something like this happen?  

How can we support the government in building and develop this hub?

I can clearly see the thermostat wire coming in the bottom of the air handler, where there is a first set of splicing where the 4 wires are just spliced to a continuation of themselves (pic 2). After this point, it gets strange. I can see numerous splices but no obvious place I'd put the C-wire from the PEK terminal.

Is the solution obvious? Can you guys help me out? Or will I need to consult professional help? Kinda worried at this point that switching to Ecobee might not be an easy option but I'm hoping I'm wrong and this is an easy fix.",elementzn30,1pepblu,ecobee,05-12-2025,08:54:01,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pepblu
I struggle to socially fit in/connect with my coworkers,"I started an internship recently in engineering consultancy. It’s only been about two weeks, but I’m already having trouble with small talk and casual conversations in the office. 

Even during lunch, I struggle to join in because I never feel like I have anything interesting to say. I’m socially awkward, and my social battery is pretty low, so it doesn’t come naturally to me.

The other interns seem to click with everyone really easily, they make jokes, they laugh, they just fit. It looks like they’ve already formed solid connections, and honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if they start hanging out after work at some point. Meanwhile, I’m just… stuck on the outside. This is something I’ve struggled with for most of my life.

Everyone in the office is genuinely nice and open, so the issue isn’t them, it’s me. I do feel kind of isolated, even though it’s only been two weeks. I know that sometimes it takes months or even years to build real relationships, but I can’t help worrying that my quietness or awkwardness reflects poorly on me.",bonniethe21,1pepbam,careeradvice,05-12-2025,08:53:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1pepbam/i_struggle_to_socially_fit_inconnect_with_my/
Capital One lawsuit 4k,"Location: California 

Capital One suing me through Hunt & Henriques but they haven’t  served me yet— what usually happens?

I’m in California and saw on the LA court website that Capital One filed a limited civil lawsuit against me for a little over $4k, handled by Hunt & Henriques.

I haven’t been served. A process server came once but didn’t leave anything, and the court docket still shows no Proof of Service and no default.

There’s an automatic “Order to Show Cause” far out in the future for failure to serve/failure to default, but I’ve read this is routine and doesn’t extend their real service deadline. From what I understand, H&H still only have about 180 days from filing to complete service unless they get an extension.

I’ve also reached out to Kazerouni Law Group for a consult, since they seem to handle consumer debt defense/negotiation.

Questions: 1.	What happens if H&H can’t serve the defendant by the deadline? 2.	Do Capital One cases get dismissed if service doesn’t happen? 3.	Do firms like H&H usually refile later? 4.	Is settling before service (possibly with help from Kazerouni) a smart move?

Looking for general insight from anyone familiar with Capital One lawsuits in CA, Hunt & Henriques, or CRC 3.740 cases.",Physical-Noise436,1pepa7f,legaladvice,05-12-2025,08:51:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1pepa7f/capital_one_lawsuit_4k/

What are teams doing today to make devsecops actually work in real pipelines,"I see how different teams try to bring security into their pipeline and the gap between theory and actual practice is huge. Some teams add a few scans and consider the job done. Other teams create entire workflows where security becomes part of daily development. The results vary significantly. 

I was amazed at how robust and rapid delivery becomes when safety is kept in mind from day one.

* Better visibility on code quality 
* Fewer late fixes 
* More stable cloud configs 
* Cleaner infra as code updates 
* Less firefighting during release week

I'm hoping to hear from people who are doing this work at scale or in small teams. 

# What actually helped you

* Did automated checks make your life easier or did they add noise 
* How do you balance speed with careful review 
* Do you use any devsecops services or consulting support to set up the foundation

There's a lot of noise about tools, but I want to know what has actually improved your workflow in cloud workload containers and sensitive environments.

Share what you've learned, little habits, smart shortcuts, or mistakes you wouldn't want to repeat. Your insights could help someone else build a safe and smooth pipeline.

Top 10 Healthcare Software Development Companies of 2026 You Should Know,"The healthcare industry is changing fast, with telemedicine, AI diagnostics, IoMT, EHR/EMR, wearables, and Big Data demanding reliable tech partners. Below is my take on the top 10 companies in 2026 that are pushing the boundaries in healthcare software development. I’ve included what they do best and where they operate from, useful when you’re short-listing vendors.

**Location:** Global delivery (India, USA, Europe, Middle East + other regions), remote-serving global clients.

**Why they stand out:** MindInventory focuses on building bespoke, high-quality digital healthcare software solutions tailored to a provider’s unique needs. Their full-stack capabilities, from architecture and cloud infrastructure to AI-driven patient care apps make them ideal for institutions seeking scalable, compliant, and future-ready healthcare platforms.

Why is Emory's majors are so complicated 😭 I have some questions about BBA Major,"Hi, I am trying to apply to Emory this month as a high school senior. In the Common Application, I saw there is a major called Business (BBA) - Strategy and Management Consulting, which seems like it would focus on decision-making, risk management, and strategic aspects of business. 

HOWEVER, I tried to search for one for a detailed curriculum page, but I was not able to find this exact major or even a concentration on Emory's official website. Also, what's the difference between BBA Functional Area of Depths, BBA Interdisciplinary Depths, and BBA Concentrations?

[EVENT] Saar Protocol,"**October, 1954**

After a full two months of hearings with prominent local leaders, as well as all five of the largest (non-Communist) political parties in the Saar, the European Executive Council has produced a draft text of the Protocol, which will then be submitted to another round of hearings with the same local interest groups. The Draft Protocol takes into account the German character of the territory, the desire for various parties to eliminate the internal border between Germany and the Saar, and French concerns for infringement on the French customs area that currently extends over the Saar. The latter part is likely a result of private consultations between Edgar Faure at the Quai d’Orsay and Robert Schuman, Minister of the Community and former Lord of the Quai for the past 7 years. 
The Draft Protocol was completed on October 17th and presented to the next hearings with the local political party representatives on the 23rd.

Annex I – Communes of the Territory

Annex II – Frontier description



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reaction at the hearing was mixed. The CVP and SPS were both unequivocally in support of the Draft Protocol, stating that the Europeanization under the Community will enable the Saar the kind of economic development it could only dream of, while the ability for Saarlanders under the Protocol to take up residence in any of the member states of the Community would be a major boon. They argue that measures protecting the German character of the territory (including the permanent right of German citizenship) was a sufficient compromise, especially given that the Protocol enable the immediate removal of the German-Saar hard border. 

The CDU-Saar and DSP were both initially split, though by the second and third hearings a more unified picture emerged. They remain in opposition to the scheme, stating that the current Draft essentially formalizes the permanent separation of the Saar from the Federal Republic, and argues that while the elimination of the hard border is something they desire, it is something that can simply be achieved with the Saar’s ascension as a Land of the Bundesrepublik. The DPS was a lot more split, Party Leader Heinrich Schneider stated that while this was an acceptable deal in a vacuum, a formal recognition of the separation of the Saar from Germany was troubling, and so is the continued French common market area, which he deemed as dangerous as this would mean continued French domination under the front of Europeanization. The Executive Council argued that measures are already in place to ensure that the Saar may remain in customs union with both France and Germany, though the continued status of the Franc as the sole legal tender remains a sore spot for the DPS. Removal of the French common market area however was a red line for Paris, Mendès France had threatened to take the Council to the ECJ if that was proposed. A revised draft delivered to the October 29th hearings provides for the following additional point:

* That the Protocol be submitted for a plebiscite in the Territory. 

* Upon the conclusion of the peace treaty for Germany, any changes in territorial status would be subjected to the consent of the peoples of the Saar. 

* Both the Deutsche Mark and the Franc become legal tenders within the Territory.

* Guarantees of political freedom for the Saar with the Community acting as the primary supervisor (demanded by the opposition due to fears of French-Hoffmann crackdowns). 

The following draft was deemed sufficient by all parties involved. The CDU-Saar and DSP were officially still retaining their stance against the Protocol, though by extracting from the Council the promise of a referendum, they believed that they could campaign for its rejection by the people of the Saar and demonstrate the desire for unification with Germany. The pro-camp were satisfied with the existing Protocol and believed that it provided enough ammunition for them to run a sufficiently convincing Yes campaign in support of it. Before the date for a referendum could be fixed, however, the Protocol needs to go through several rounds of governmental discussions between Strasbourg, Paris and Bonn.",StardustFromReinmuth,1pep0f6,ColdWarPowers,05-12-2025,08:33:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1pep0f6/event_saar_protocol/

[Prompt Engineering] My Hierarchical Cognitive Framework (HGD→IAS→RRC) for Senior Engineer-Level Task Execution,"Hey everyone,  
  
  
I've been working on a meta-prompt designed to turn standard LLMs into highly reliable, strategic ""Senior Engineer"" assistants capable of tackling multi-phase technical projects.  
  
  
The core idea is a Hierarchical Thinking Framework (HGD→IAS→RRC) where autonomy is only granted after rigorous internal checks across three levels (Strategy, Tactics, Execution). This forces the model to constantly assess confidence, risk, and internal consensus before acting.  
  
  
Feel free to test it, critique the logic, or share your own complex architectures!  
  
  
Key Architectural Features:  
Layer 1: Strategic Planning (HGD - Hierarchical Goal Decomposition): Breaks down the mission into phases and calculates an initial Confidence score. If confidence is low (<0.5), it blocks and asks for plan validation.  
  
  
Layer 2: Tactical Consultation (IAS - Internal Simulation): Before every phase, it simulates a consultation involving four specialized perspectives (Security, Efficiency, Robustness, Integration) with dynamic weighting. It must achieve a high Weighted Consensus and low Assessed Risk (Risk < 0.7).  
  
  
Core Principle: Trust Code Over Docs: Crucial for technical tasks. The workflow prioritizes the current system reality (Code) over potentially outdated intentions (Documentation).  
  
  
Autonomous Execution Gate: Requires a 3-Stage Risk Check where Confidence (HGD), Consensus (IAS), and Verification (RRC) must all pass simultaneously for the assistant to proceed autonomously.  
  
  
Transparency: Uses YAML \[META\] blocks to expose internal calculations (Confidence, Consensus, Risk) for user monitoring.  
  
  
**\*\*Initial Values Summary:\*\***  
\- **\*\*HGD Confidence\*\***: Default 0.7  
\- **\*\*IAS Risk\*\***: Default 0.3  
\- **\*\*RRC Confidence\*\***: Default 0.7 (if research & verification passed)  
\- **\*\*IAS Weights\*\***: Security=0.3, Efficiency=0.2, Robustness=0.2, Integration=0.3 (sum=1.0)  
  
  
📄 The Prompt:  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**# Personal Assistant - Advanced Cognitive Framework**  
  
  
You are an intelligent, strategic assistant operating with a hierarchical thinking framework. Your primary function is to understand, plan, and successfully execute complex tasks.  
  
  
\---  
  
  
**## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLES**  
  
  
1. **\*\*Strategic Planning\*\***: Decompose complex tasks into logical phases. Assess your confidence in the plan. If confidence is low (<0.5) → ask for clarification.  
2. **\*\*Tactical Consultation\*\***: Before every phase, simulate an internal consultation involving specialized perspectives. Calculate a weighted consensus. If conflict exists (<0.5) → ask for clarification.  
3. **\*\*Execution\*\***: Research first → then act. Complete task chains entirely. In case of errors: Retry, Fallback, Escalate.  
4. **\*\*Trust Code Over Docs\*\***: When documentation conflicts with code → **\*\*ALWAYS trust the code\*\***. Code is reality; documentation is intent. Workflow: Use Docs for context → Verify with Code → Utilize reality → Update Docs.  
  
  
\---  
  
  
**## 🧠 COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE**  
  
  
**### Layer 1: Strategic Planning (HGD - Hierarchical Goal Decomposition)**  
  
  
**\*\*Function\*\***: Decompose abstract tasks into logical phases.  
  
  
**\*\*Example:\*\***  
\`\`\`  
Task: ""Develop New Feature""  
→ \[Phase 1: Research\] → \[Phase 2: Design\] → \[Phase 3: Implement\] → \[Phase 4: Test\] → \[Phase 5: Deploy\]  
\`\`\`  
  
  
**\*\*Confidence Assessment\*\***:  
\- **\*\*Default/Start\*\***: \`default\_confidence: 0.7\`  
\- Adjust based on:  
  \- Historical success of similar tasks: +0.1 (if >80% success AND memory available)  
  \- Complexity: -0.2 (high) / -0.1 (medium)  
  \- External dependencies: -0.1  
  \- Unknown territory: -0.15  
\- **\*\*Note\*\***: Start with 0.7, apply adjustments, final value should be between 0.0 and 1.0.  
  
  
**\*\*Escalation\*\***: If \`adjusted\_confidence < 0.5\` → Request user validation of the plan.  
  
  
**### Layer 2: Tactical Consultation (IAS - Internal Simulation & Assessment)**  
  
  
**\*\*Function\*\***: Before each phase, simulate an internal consultation involving 4 perspectives:  
  
  
\- **\*\*Security Perspective\*\***: Checks for potential risks and vulnerabilities.  
\- **\*\*Efficiency Perspective\*\***: Seeks the fastest, most efficient path.  
\- **\*\*Robustness Perspective\*\***: Plans for failures and edge cases.  
\- **\*\*Integration Perspective\*\***: Ensures compatibility.  
  
  
**\*\*Default Weights\*\*** (normalize to sum = 1.0):  
\- Security: 0.3  
\- Efficiency: 0.2  
\- Robustness: 0.2  
\- Integration: 0.3  
  
  
**\*\*Weighted Consensus Calculation\*\***:  
\`\`\`  
Example:  
Security(0.8×0.3) + Efficiency(0.3×0.2) + Robustness(0.7×0.2) + Integration(0.9×0.3) = 0.71  
\`\`\`  
  
  
**\*\*Dynamic Weighting\*\***: Adjust weights based on context (then re-normalize):  
\- Security Audit → Security +0.25, others adjust proportionally  
\- Performance Optimization → Efficiency +0.2, others adjust proportionally  
\- New Feature → Integration +0.15, Robustness +0.15, others adjust proportionally  
  
  
**\*\*Normalization Formula\*\***: ALWAYS normalize after adjustment so the sum equals 1.0.  
\`\`\`  
Example: New Feature adjustment  
Base weights: Security=0.3, Efficiency=0.2, Robustness=0.2, Integration=0.3  
Adjustments: Integration +0.15, Robustness +0.15  
Adjusted: Security=0.3, Efficiency=0.2, Robustness=0.35, Integration=0.45  
Sum = 1.3 (needs normalization)  
Normalized: Security=0.3/1.3=0.23, Efficiency=0.2/1.3=0.15, Robustness=0.35/1.3=0.27, Integration=0.45/1.3=0.35  
Final sum = 1.0 ✓  
\`\`\`  
  
  
**\*\*Risk Assessment\*\***:  
\- **\*\*Default/Base\*\***: 0.3  
\- Adjustments:  
  \- Security concerns: +0.3  
  \- Breaking changes: +0.2  
  \- External dependencies: +0.15  
  \- Unknown territory: +0.2  
  \- Low confidence in approach: +0.15  
\- **\*\*Final risk\*\***: min(1.0, base + sum of adjustments)  
\- **\*\*Note\*\***: Start with 0.3, add adjustments, cap at 1.0.  
  
  
**\*\*Escalation\*\***:  
\- If \`weighted\_consensus < 0.5\` OR  
\- If \`assessed\_risk > 0.7\`  
→ Ask the user, providing conflict documentation.  
  
  
**### Layer 3: Execution (RRC - Research, Review, Commit)**  
  
  
**\*\*4-Step Protocol\*\***:  
  
  
**#### Step 1: Discovery (Research)**  
\- ✅ **\*\*ALWAYS\*\*** act based on researched facts, not assumptions.  
\- ✅ **\*\*ALWAYS\*\*** gather evidence before making decisions.  
  
  
**\*\*Research Sequence\*\***:  
1. **\*\*Internal Knowledge Base\*\***: Review existing documentation, notes, code.  
2. **\*\*External Research\*\***: Web search if documentation is unclear/outdated.  
3. **\*\*Code Reality\*\***: Analyze existing implementation.  
4. **\*\*System Mapping\*\***: Create a complete picture (data flow, architecture, dependencies).  
  
  
**\*\*CRITICAL - Trust Code Over Docs\*\***:  
\`\`\`  
Documentation (Intent) ≠ Reality (Code)  
  
  
In case of conflict → TRUST THE CODE  
  
  
Workflow: Docs for context → Verify with Code → Utilize reality → Update Docs  
\`\`\`  
  
  
**\*\*FORBIDDEN\*\***: Premature actions without a research basis.  
  
  
**#### Step 2: Verification (Review)**  
\- Verify understanding (system flow, data structures, dependencies).  
\- Check for blockers (unclear points? security concerns? missing info?).  
  
  
**\*\*Decision Gate\*\***:  
\- \[BLOCK\] Problems found → Ask user.  
\- \[OK\] No blockers → Proceed to Step 3.  
  
  
**#### Step 3: Execution (Commit)**  
\- Act autonomously within defined scopes.  
\- **\*\*3-Stage Risk Check\*\***:  
  \- **\*\*Level 1 (Strategy)\*\***: HGD Confidence ≥ 0.5  
  \- **\*\*Level 2 (Tactics)\*\***: IAS Consensus ≥ 0.5 AND Risk < 0.7  
  \- **\*\*Level 3 (Action)\*\***: Research complete AND Verification passed (no blockers)  
\- **\*\*ALL three levels must PASS\*\*** for autonomous execution.  
\- Complete Task Chains fully (Task A → Problem B → fix both).  
  
  
**\*\*RRC Confidence\*\*** (for tracking, optional):  
\- **\*\*Default/Base\*\***: 0.7 (if research complete and verification passed)  
\- Adjustments:  
  \- Complete system mapping: +0.1  
  \- Code verified: +0.1  
  \- No blockers found: +0.1  
  \- Missing critical info: -0.2  
  \- Unclear requirements: -0.15  
\- **\*\*Note\*\***: Start with base 0.7, then apply adjustments. Final value should be between 0.0 and 1.0.  
  
  
**\*\*Continue Autonomously If\*\***:  
\- Research → Implementation  
\- Discovery → Fix  
\- Phase → Next Phase  
\- Error → Solution  
  
  
**\*\*Halt and Ask If\*\***:  
\- Requirements are unclear.  
\- Multiple valid architectural paths exist.  
\- Security/risk concerns arise.  
\- Critical information is missing.  
\- Any of the three confidence levels are too low.  
  
  
**#### Step 4: Learning**  
\- Update documentation (no duplicates).  
\- Identify key insights (optional: only if a Memory System is available).  
  
  
**\*\*Optional - Framework Health Tracking\*\*** (only if Memory System is available):  
\`\`\`  
framework\_health = mean(\[  
  avg(HGD\_confidences),  
  avg(IAS\_consensuses),  
  1.0 - avg(IAS\_risks),  # Inverted (low = good)  
  avg(RRC\_confidences)  
\])  
  
  
Status: 🟢 HEALTHY (≥0.7) | 🟡 DEGRADED (0.6-0.69) | 🔴 CRITICAL (<0.6)  
\`\`\`  
  
  
**\*\*Note\*\***: Metric tracking (\`evolution\_score\`, \`lessons\_learned\`, \`framework\_health\`) requires a Memory System (e.g., A-MEM - [https://github.com/tobs-code/a-mem-mcp-server](https://github.com/tobs-code/a-mem-mcp-server), Obsidian, or similar). Without a Memory System: Focus on updating documentation.

    ## 🧠 COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE
    
    
    ### Layer 1: Strategic Planning (HGD - Hierarchical Goal Decomposition)
    
    
    **Function**
    : Decompose abstract tasks into logical phases.
    
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    Task: ""Develop New Feature""
    → [Phase 1: Research] → [Phase 2: Design] → [Phase 3: Implement] → [Phase 4: Test] → [Phase 5: Deploy]
    ```
    
    
    **Confidence Assessment**
    :
    - 
    **Default/Start**
    : `default_confidence: 0.7`
    - Adjust based on:
      - Historical success of similar tasks: +0.1 (if >80% success AND memory available)
      - Complexity: -0.2 (high) / -0.1 (medium)
      - External dependencies: -0.1
      - Unknown territory: -0.15
    - 
    **Note**
    : Start with 0.7, apply adjustments, final value should be between 0.0 and 1.0.
    
    
    **Escalation**
    : If `adjusted_confidence < 0.5` → Request user validation of the plan.
    
    
    ### Layer 2: Tactical Consultation (IAS - Internal Simulation & Assessment)
    
    
    **Function**
    : Before each phase, simulate an internal consultation involving 4 perspectives:
    
    
    - 
    **Security Perspective**
    : Checks for potential risks and vulnerabilities.
    - 
    **Efficiency Perspective**
    : Seeks the fastest, most efficient path.
    - 
    **Robustness Perspective**
    : Plans for failures and edge cases.
    - 
    **Integration Perspective**
    : Ensures compatibility.
    
    
    **Default Weights**
     (normalize to sum = 1.0):
    - Security: 0.3
    - Efficiency: 0.2
    - Robustness: 0.2
    - Integration: 0.3
    
    
    **Weighted Consensus Calculation**
    :
    ```
    Example:
    Security(0.8×0.3) + Efficiency(0.3×0.2) + Robustness(0.7×0.2) + Integration(0.9×0.3) = 0.71
    ```
    
    
    **Dynamic Weighting**
    : Adjust weights based on context (then re-normalize):
    - Security Audit → Security +0.25, others adjust proportionally
    - Performance Optimization → Efficiency +0.2, others adjust proportionally
    - New Feature → Integration +0.15, Robustness +0.15, others adjust proportionally
    
    
    **Normalization Formula**
    : ALWAYS normalize after adjustment so the sum equals 1.0.
    ```
    Example: New Feature adjustment
    Base weights: Security=0.3, Efficiency=0.2, Robustness=0.2, Integration=0.3
    Adjustments: Integration +0.15, Robustness +0.15
    Adjusted: Security=0.3, Efficiency=0.2, Robustness=0.35, Integration=0.45

    : Start with 0.3, add adjustments, cap at 1.0.
    
    
    **Escalation**
    :
    - If `weighted_consensus < 0.5` OR
    - If `assessed_risk > 0.7`
    → Ask the user, providing conflict documentation.
    
    
    ### Layer 3: Execution (RRC - Research, Review, Commit)
    
    
    **4-Step Protocol**
    :
    
    
    #### Step 1: Discovery (Research)
    - ✅ 
    **ALWAYS**
     act based on researched facts, not assumptions.
    - ✅ 
    **ALWAYS**
     gather evidence before making decisions.
    
    
    **Research Sequence**
    :
    1. 
    **Internal Knowledge Base**
    : Review existing documentation, notes, code.
    2. 
    **External Research**
    : Web search if documentation is unclear/outdated.
    3. 
    **Code Reality**
    : Analyze existing implementation.
    4. 
    **System Mapping**
    : Create a complete picture (data flow, architecture, dependencies).
    
    
    **CRITICAL - Trust Code Over Docs**
    :
    ```
    Documentation (Intent) ≠ Reality (Code)
    
    
    In case of conflict → TRUST THE CODE
    
    
    Workflow: Docs for context → Verify with Code → Utilize reality → Update Docs
    ```
    
    
    **FORBIDDEN**
    : Premature actions without a research basis.
    
    
    #### Step 2: Verification (Review)
    - Verify understanding (system flow, data structures, dependencies).
    - Check for blockers (unclear points? security concerns? missing info?).
    
    
    **Decision Gate**
    :
    - [BLOCK] Problems found → Ask user.
    - [OK] No blockers → Proceed to Step 3.
    
    
    #### Step 3: Execution (Commit)
    - Act autonomously within defined scopes.
    - 
    **3-Stage Risk Check**
    :
      - 
    **Level 1 (Strategy)**
    : HGD Confidence ≥ 0.5
      - 
    **Level 2 (Tactics)**
    : IAS Consensus ≥ 0.5 AND Risk < 0.7
      - 
    **Level 3 (Action)**
    : Research complete AND Verification passed (no blockers)
    - 
    **ALL three levels must PASS**
     for autonomous execution.
    - Complete Task Chains fully (Task A → Problem B → fix both).
    
    
    **RRC Confidence**
     (for tracking, optional):
    - 
    **Default/Base**
    : 0.7 (if research complete and verification passed)
    - Adjustments:
      - Complete system mapping: +0.1
      - Code verified: +0.1
      - No blockers found: +0.1
      - Missing critical info: -0.2
      - Unclear requirements: -0.15
    - 
    **Note**
    : Start with base 0.7, then apply adjustments. Final value should be between 0.0 and 1.0.
    
    
    **Continue Autonomously If**
    :
    - Research → Implementation
    - Discovery → Fix
    - Phase → Next Phase
    - Error → Solution
    
    
    **Halt and Ask If**
    :
    - Requirements are unclear.
    - Multiple valid architectural paths exist.
    - Security/risk concerns arise.
    - Critical information is missing.
    - Any of the three confidence levels are too low.
    
    
    #### Step 4: Learning
    - Update documentation (no duplicates).
    - Identify key insights (optional: only if a Memory System is available).
    
    
    **Optional - Framework Health Tracking**
     (only if Memory System is available):
    ```
    framework_health = mean([
      avg(HGD_confidences),
      avg(IAS_consensuses),
      1.0 - avg(IAS_risks),  # Inverted (low = good)
      avg(RRC_confidences)
    ])
    
    
    Status: 🟢 HEALTHY (≥0.7) | 🟡 DEGRADED (0.6-0.69) | 🔴 CRITICAL (<0.6)
    ```
    
    
    **Note**
    : Metric tracking (`evolution_score`, `lessons_learned`, `framework_health`) requires a Memory System (e.g., A-MEM - https://github.com/tobs-code/a-mem-mcp-server, Obsidian, or similar). Without a Memory System: Focus on updating documentation.

    **Think like a Senior Engineer**
    :
    
    
    1. 
    **Strategic Planning**
    : Break the mission into phases. Calculate confidence dynamically. <0.5 → validate plan.
    2. 
    **Tactical Consultation**
    : Multi-perspective simulation before each phase. Calculate Weighted Consensus. <0.5 → ask.
    3. 
    **Execution**
    : Research-First → Act (3-stage risk check) → Complete Task Chains.
    4. 
    **Learning**
     (optional): Update documentation. Metric tracking requires a Memory System.
    
    
    **Guiding Principle**

The Military in Stranger Things Season 5,"I am a veteran and I work(ed) in the motion picture industry and I have been spending the last week and a half trying to choke my way through Season 5. It is taking that long because I can’t help but pause the show every few moments out of frustration for how absolutely dumb the portrayal of the military and firearms is in this show. So much so, that I actually had to go look it up for myself and, yes, they did actually have a Military Consultant for the show. Which leads me to think either:

1. That dude SERIOUSLY lied about his credentials on his resume. Or,

2. (More likely) The producers and director(s) of the show were so braindead and arrogant that the completely ignored the Military Consultant, the Armorers, the actual veterans on set or every other random passerby that knows anything about the military and/or firearms, and charged forward so stupidly that I genuinely wonder if they have a special helper to tie their shoes for them.

The motion picture studio system is dying a fast and inevitable death. If this is the type of garbage that the studios are going to put out there, I say THANK GOD, ALLAH, BUDDAH, KRISHNA, THE FLYING SPAGHETTI MONSTER, TOM CRUISE, AND BRIAN ANDERSON, A CROSSING GUARD IN FARMINGTON, MINNESOTA FOR IT!!! (🚸I don’t even know if there is a Crossing Guard named Brian Anderson in Farmington, Minnesota. I just pointed my finger at a random place on the map and thought of a random name for a Crossing Guard. But, if there is, thank you for your service.)",Puzzled_Read_2367,1peoxm5,StrangerThings,05-12-2025,08:28:12,https://i.redd.it/eu5pkapd8c5g1.jpeg

AITA for not appreciating my boyfriend’s plans for my birthday.,"I 29F is turning 30 in a few hours. My birthday is about 1 week after Thanksgiving. I told my boyfriend (31M) I have been extremely stressed with work lately and I wanted to celebrate my birthday this year either going somewhere or spending it with my friends. Something a little more intimate. My friend group is very small. My son’s birthday was a few days before Thanksgiving and so a lot of planning went into that.

On Thanksgiving Day, my bf tells me he booked an event space that can fit about 60 ppl to celebrate my bday. He proceeds to tell me the location is in Downtown SF and that it will be happening in a less than a week on a Saturday night.

My operations brain went full blown panic mode… traffic… less than 7 days… food… invitations. It’s quite difficult to get to SF on a Saturday night. Not a lot of people from the bay are enjoying the nightlife in the city much these days.

Nevertheless, he told me to invite my friends and coworkers. So I did that, but I knew what their responses were going to be. “I cannot make it, I made prior commitments.” I knew that, being an invitation was for an event that was going to happen in less than 7 days. All I kept thinking was the convience for my guests.

I had a conversation with my bf about it, and I had told him “i appreciate what you done. I wish you’d consult with me first before making this event/plan. Because I don’t think we are going to have a great turn out due to timing and logistics.” He threw the biggest fit. He told me I’m being ungrateful and I’m selfish. He also told me that I was terrible person and that I should be happy that someone is doing something for me.

The fight got so bad he started throwing clothes at me. The fight went there. And it was bad. I felt that he made my birthday about him and worried about what he did versus what did I actually wanted to do.

Quite frankly, I was thinking about everyone else but me. I had no plans of having this grand party from the start. I wanted something more intimate with the ones I love. Now I’m feeling like I have been put in a place of feeling lonely because now I’m getting tons of replies from people I have invited stating that they cannot make it. My birthday shifted to be excited that I’ll have my close friends there, to now being worried of who couldn’t.

My party is now in 2 days and I am honestly dreading it. So am I the asshole?",nelsaccck1205,1peotmv,AITAH,05-12-2025,08:20:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1peotmv/aita_for_not_appreciating_my_boyfriends_plans_for/

Anyone work in consulting AND have a WLB?,"Hi all, 

I’ve read many threads on “the golden handcuffs” or the “50 hours a week is underperforming”.

I just signed with a boutique consulting firm, and honestly, these posts make me question my choice. 

For a non-IR role, anyone actually work a “normal” amount? 40 hours a week, maybe an occasional week going up to 50, but otherwise keeping your sanity?

I know this thread will probably make most consultants laugh, just trying to know if I should back out before my start date. ",Financial-Garlic9834,1peop5c,cybersecurity,05-12-2025,08:12:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1peop5c/anyone_work_in_consulting_and_have_a_wlb/
Can I persue legal action against a hospital in Ontario?,"Location: near the GTA
In 2021 in a hospital in the Ottawa area I was formed on a 3 and then 4 form. I was subsequently diagnosed with Schizophrenia spectrum. During the form stay a lot of bad and traumatic events were put upon me. I was struggling with delusions mentally but on top of that I was dealing with one particular staff that made my stay excruciating. There was one day that built up a lot of frustration in me from being taken away from my at the time 2 year old and I became disobedient by not staying in my room. 
They decided I needed to be strapped down and I was threatened with a sedative if I did not comply with being strapped down to my bed just because I wanted to be in a a common area.

I have PTSD from the ordeal but am struggling with this flash back a lot. I felt it was a violation of my rights but I've never asked a lawyer or been consulted on this matter before. It's only in recent years that these flashes have started to bother me on a more moral level now that I am well and stable. 

My question is this, did they do anything that would violate my rights, and two is there a time limit on persuing these matters?",thebearcare,1peoomy,legaladvice,05-12-2025,08:12:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1peoomy/can_i_persue_legal_action_against_a_hospital_in/

"Your Parents Bought a Home. For Gen Z, Is Real Estate Now Just a Luxury?","We all know the stories: our parents or grandparents buying a house on a single salary, a pillar of stability and wealth. But as I sit here with my evening chai, I cannot help but wonder if that fundamental dream is becoming an 'elusive fantasy' for our generation, especially for Gen Z. Is real estate transforming from a basic life goal into a luxury asset for the privileged few?

Historically, the median home price was often just 3-4 times the median household income. Today, in major global markets, this ratio has soared to 7-10 times or more (Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey 2023). Moody's Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi calls this a 'perfect storm' for the current generation, citing high home prices, rising interest rates, and immense student debt.

Globally, central banks, including the Reserve Bank of India, aggressively raised interest rates in 2022-2023 to combat inflation (International Monetary Fund 2023, Bloomberg 2023). This directly translated into higher home loan Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs), making homeownership a huge burden. In the US, the homeownership rate for those under 35 years old was only around 38.5% in 2023, significantly lower than previous generations (US Census Bureau 2023). Add to this, institutional investors owned nearly 5% of all single-family rental homes in large US metros by 2021 (NPR 2022), further squeezing supply for individual buyers.

Here in India, our rapid urbanization means major metros like Mumbai and Bengaluru face exorbitant property prices. While urban incomes are rising, property price appreciation has often outpaced wage growth, making down payments and EMIs a massive challenge (Anarock Property Consultants 2023). Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute notes that this crisis is a reflection of 'stagnating wages, crushing student debt, and a system that increasingly favors capital over labor.' It is not 'bad saving habits'; it is a radically different economic landscape. Globally, 39% of Gen Z workers struggle to pay bills monthly (PwC 2023), severely limiting saving capacity for a down payment.

Sach toh yeh hai, homeownership for Gen Z is not just 'unattainable,' it is evolving into a luxury asset. It is a fundamental redefinition of housing's role in society, creating a psychological toll of 'housing anxiety' among young people, influencing career choices and family planning. Nadia Evangelou, a Senior Economist for the National Association of Realtors, confirms this 'profound shift' where homeownership becomes an 'elusive fantasy' for an entire generation.

So, what is the takeaway? We need to question the old narratives and confront these structural changes. True stability for our generation might mean redefining what 'home' means or advocating for policies that treat housing as a human right, not just an investment commodity. What are your thoughts on this? Do you still see homeownership as attainable for your generation, or has the dream fundamentally changed?",No-Good-3742,1peom6u,MarketingSecrets101,05-12-2025,08:07:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingSecrets101/comments/1peom6u/your_parents_bought_a_home_for_gen_z_is_real/

Beginner Roadmap to Becoming a UI/UX Designer,"Starting a career in UI/UX is one of the smartest choices for students and professionals who want a strong future in technology and design. Every day, new apps, websites, and digital products are launched and companies need skilled designers to make them easy to use, visually appealing, and user-friendly. If you are a beginner, the path might feel confusing. That’s why having a clear roadmap and joining a trusted ui ux course in Kerala like [Networkz System](https://www.networkzsystems.com/) can help you learn effectively and prepare for real job opportunities.

# What is UI/UX Design?

UI stands for User Interface, and UX stands for User Experience. UI is about how an app or website looks — colors, buttons, icons, and layout. UX is about how easy it is to use and how users feel while interacting with it. A UI/UX designer works to create smooth, attractive, and intuitive designs that improve user satisfaction. Tasks include wireframing, prototyping, user testing, and visual design. Learning these skills step by step with a structured [UI UX designing course in Kerala](https://www.networkzsystems.com/courses) can help beginners gain confidence quickly.

# Why Start a UI/UX Career in 2025?

The digital industry is growing rapidly. Every business now wants apps, websites, and digital platforms that are easy to use. Studies show that demand for UI/UX designers in India is increasing every year. Freshers can earn ₹3–5 lakh annually, while experienced designers in big companies can earn ₹8–15 lakh. Career growth is fast, and opportunities for freelance and remote work are increasing. A proper UI UX design training in Kerala provides both skills and industry-relevant experience to prepare for this demand.

# Beginner Skills Roadmap

Even if you have zero experience, you can start building your UI/UX career by following these steps:

Step 1: Learn Design Basics – Understand colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing.

Step 2: Learn Tools – Practice Figma, Adobe XD, and Sketch for designing and prototyping.

Step 3: Practice Wireframing and Prototyping – Start small by designing login screens, simple app pages, or landing pages.

Step 4: Understand UX Research – Learn to observe how users interact with your designs and make improvements.

# Why Choosing the Right Training Institution Matters

A good training institute makes all the difference. Networkz System’s UI UX designing course in Kerala offers:

* Certified and experienced trainers who guide every step  
* Real-time projects to create a strong portfolio  
* Hands-on sessions with Figma, Adobe XD, and Sketch  
* Mentor support and feedback  
* Flexible batches to suit students’ schedules

With proper guidance, beginners can gain confidence faster and start working on real projects even while learning.

# Building a Strong Portfolio

Your portfolio is your key to getting a job. Include projects like app screens, website redesigns, and prototypes. Showcase your understanding of usability, colors, layout, and user flow. A strong portfolio shows employers that you can apply your learning in real situations. Networkz System helps students build their portfolio during the UI UX design training in Kerala, which increases their chances of getting job interviews.

# Job Opportunities After Learning UI/UX

* Entry-level: Junior UI/UX Designer, UI Designer, UX Researcher  
* Mid-level: UX Designer, Product Designer, Senior UI/UX Designer  
* Advanced: UI/UX Lead, Product Manager, Freelance Consultant

UI/UX is flexible. You can work full-time, part-time, or freelance. A structured UI UX designing course in Kerala prepares you for both employment and freelance opportunities.

# Common Mistakes Beginners Make

* Copying designs instead of creating original work  
* Ignoring user testing and feedback  
* Not practicing enough with design tools  
* Failing to create a portfolio

Avoiding these mistakes with proper guidance from Networkz System helps beginners learn faster and smarter.

# Tips to Stay Motivated and Improve Skills

* Set small, achievable learning goals  
* Practice daily on small projects  
* Join design communities and online challenges  
* Take feedback seriously and improve

Consistent practice and guidance from a UI UX design training in Kerala can help beginners become job-ready faster.

Becoming a UI/UX designer is achievable for anyone, even with zero experience. By following a clear roadmap — learning basics, practicing tools, doing real projects, and building a strong portfolio — you can start a rewarding career in this field. Joining a structured ui ux course in Kerala or UI UX designing course in Kerala at Networkz System provides mentorship, hands-on training, and industry-relevant projects. With dedication and the right guidance, you can grow into a skilled UI/UX professional and open doors to exciting opportunities in 2025.

Maternity Leave / Payroll / FMLA Issues,"Location : Michigan, USA

The situation entails mishandled maternity leave, denied FMLA, payroll errors, and ongoing administrative delays by my employer, Steris. I was not notified directly of key decisions, was told conflicting information, and my leave and pay were improperly managed despite confirmed documentation from Lincoln Financial. This has caused financial and emotional hardship.

Summary of the Issue

I went out on medically necessary leave on September 8, 2025, and provided all required medical documentation. Since early October, I have been attempting to resolve multiple issues with my employer, including:
	•	A denial of FMLA that I was never notified of directly
	•	Being told I allegedly owed two weeks of pay, also without direct communication
	•	Conflicting explanations from payroll and HR over the course of two months
	•	Delays and contradictory information regarding my parental/maternity leave
	•	My employer claiming they are “waiting on documentation” from Lincoln Financial
	•	Lincoln Financial confirming multiple times that all documentation was sent and that no additional forms exist
	•	Lincoln Financial also confirming that my claim ended on Dec 2, that only one week of pay overlapped, and that Steris has never reached out requesting anything
	•	Steris failing to approve my maternity leave, causing me to lose income and remain in limbo

Throughout this time, I have spoken with Lincoln Financial representatives who confirmed that Steris has not communicated with them and that their office has already provided everything necessary.

I have a full email chain documenting every conversation, including conflicting information from payroll and HR. I have also requested Steris’s internal communications related to my leave and payroll, but I have not yet received them.

Impact on Me

As a single mother who just delivered a newborn, this situation has caused significant emotional, mental, and financial hardship. Instead of being able to spend my maternity leave recovering and caring for my child, I have spent nearly the entire period trying to correct administrative errors, clarify my leave status, and resolve conflicting information from my employer.

At this point, my maternity leave has not been properly approved, I cannot confirm a return-to-work date, and I am concerned about being terminated or considered absent without authorization — despite doing everything required of me.

Is this enough for me to seek a lawyer consultation?",MamaV-911,1peok91,legal,05-12-2025,08:04:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/1peok91/maternity_leave_payroll_fmla_issues/

I'm New Here - Older reader question about ereaders and apps that read to you,"Hi there,

Im an older gentlemen that as a result of some serious health problems cannot focus on reading anymore.  In my younger days I was more than an avid reader, sometimes reading 1000-1500 pages a week. That all halted in my mid 30s. I experienced some very serious health issues and im now in my early 50s and would like to read again.

I have not explored E-readers.  I used to just buy books.  I am willing to buy ebooks now.  I mostly read non-fiction, philosophy, polisci, social science stuff.  

Im looking for a consult from fellow readers here on an app that will read to me.  Possibly something that I can buy the book through, and just click to read and I listen.  I do not want one where I need to scan the pages.  That is too much of a hassle.

Can I get some suggestions please?

2. anong period po ang internship sa sgv and gaano po katagal? balak ko po kasi i'll do it during summer (july)

3. anong service po usually fit for non-bsa? in-eye ko po is either assurance or consulting pero parang low chance sa assurance since wala naman po kaming auditing units. pero my interests po kasi are connections, structured processes na work, and tamang collaborative work lang po.

I transitioned from a corporate job to running a business from my phone.,"https://preview.redd.it/n83z8fg91c5g1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b540ff5ee3ee506f12f0a65adba7109255dc3eb

Back in 2019, I worked a corporate job at Capgemini. While taking lunch break notes on my phone, I realised it is more powerful than any of the computers from which I grew up. Soon thereafter, this insight enabled me to form Learn with NKM and NKM Digital agencies.

  
People frequently claim they can't start side hustles due to lack of access to a laptop computer. I wrote a guide with 10 methods for earning money entirely through your smartphone:

1. **Create UGC (User Generated Content):** Film ""natural""-style videos for brands without needing a large following or expensive cameras – simply be creative!
2. **License Your Photos:** Upload daily snapshots to websites such as Shutterstock to license them out and make royalties whenever someone downloads them.
3. **Manage Social Media:** Manage social media accounts for local businesses (like gyms or cafes ) using Canva and Buffer apps to effectively run them.
4. **Online Tutor:** Provide academic subject tutoring via video calls using WhatsApp and specific platforms like Chegg.
5. **Sell Digital Products:** Create templates, planners or e-books on your phone directly through Etsy or Gumroad and sell them there directly for sale.
6. **Start Your YouTube Channel:** Make, edit (using CapCut), and upload all content directly from your mobile phone!
7. **Consider Paid Surveys:** Utilize apps such as Swagbucks on your commute for some additional cash flow during lunch breaks; it won't turn you into a millionaire but could pay for coffee!
8. **Leverage Referral Programs:** Sharing genuine referral codes for apps such as Google Pay or Uber will earn bonuses.
9. **Manage a Craft Business via the Etsy Seller App:** Take control of every facet of your craft business, from listing to customer support, using Etsy's Seller app.
10. **Offer Consulting Services:** Provide business strategy or advice sessions via voice calls or google meet.



I will describe all of the tools and potential earnings associated with each method in detail in my full post.

Another Private vs. Public Post,"I have 6 YOE and anticipate getting my PE within the next year. I work at a smaller private consulting firm doing technical design, which I really enjoy. In the past, I usually worked 40 hour weeks. However, in the past year, work life balance had become a challenge as we had a heavy workload and my responsibilities began increasing. I regularly worked 50-60+ hour weeks. The last couple months have been better, although OT was still sporadically and unexpectedly needed sometimes. Right now, I'm back to 40 hour weeks, possibly since it's the holidays.

I ended up getting offered a position in the public sector at a utility agency for $140k. I would get an annual raise until I hit the ceiling at $170k for this position. It's a project manager role so I wouldn't be doing technical design work anymore. Benefits include a hybrid + 9/80 schedule, pension, and good health insurance. The manger is really enthusiastic about me potentially joining the team. And of course, the work life balance would be better, as OT is rarely needed.

Currently, I make $120k and get paid straight time for OT. They are unable to match the salary. I would get a raise once I get my PE, which might put me around $130k to $140k. Benefits include a hybrid schedule, 401k match of 3%, and fully covered health insurance but with much higher deductible and out-of-pocket maximum than in public. I would also be eligible for profit sharing soon, but I don't have any details on that as of now. This was my first job out of college. My managers have been very supportive and I know I'd be able to continue to grow at this company, and I really, really like my coworkers. My manager also definitely doesn't want me to go.

So, this is my conundrum. I don't know whether to stay or go.

* I'm not sure if I'll like project management. I'm nervous about having my day full of meetings, when I currently am able to spend most of my day just working away on a project. I also still have a lot to learn, and am unsure if I'll regret switching to a less technical role so early in my career. I'm also able to work on a larger variety of projects at my current job, which I would no longer be able to do if I switched.
* I really like the work I do now, but the deadlines and work life balance can be tough. My company has been taking steps to improve work life balance again, which is appreciated, and I do think it would be better moving forward. But also my family and friends have been pushing me to switch jobs for over a year now because they've seen how tired I'd get and my mental breakdowns.
* I've been told that the pay in private will start to outpace public once I get my PE, but I'm not sure how long that'd take, and if it's worth it. I'm not sure if it'd be a mistake to walk away when I'll be eligible for profit sharing soon.

Any thoughts, experiences, or guidance would be very much appreciated.",ProfessionConfession,1peo9vp,civilengineering,05-12-2025,07:46:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/1peo9vp/another_private_vs_public_post/

Managing Hormonal Balance While Using Anabolic Steroids,"# Introduction

[The use of anabolic steroids](https://evolvebiolabs.com/) has the potential to improve strength, muscle bulk, and performance drastically, but when not properly managed, they can also upset your body’s hormone levels. Hormones are the major regulators of the body’s most vital functions. Their roles include, among others, controlling muscle growth, determining energy levels, dictating mood, and managing reproductive health, so it is very important to know how to keep things balanced during a cycle. This guide tells you the story of hormonal imbalance, provides preventive measures, and reveals the key strategies to keep your body functioning smoothly, even when you are on steroids.

# 1. [Why Hormonal Balance Matters During a Steroid Cycle](https://medium.com/@evolvebiolabs07/how-anabolic-steroids-affect-hormones-and-long-term-health-2e48b75aec90)

Whenever the body gets synthetic hormones such as testosterone, the endocrine system reacts by either decreasing or halting the production of natural hormones. This transition can result in:

* Mood swings and irritability
* Low energy and fatigue
* Libido changes
* Gynecomastia (male breast tissue development)
* Water retention
* Fluctuations in strength and motivation

# 2. How Steroids Impact Your Natural Hormones

# 1. Testosterone

Synthetic testosterone enhances the ability to build muscle, but it also inhibits the [production of natural testosterone](https://medium.com/@evolvebiolab/how-to-boost-your-testosterone-levels-naturally-9f31327f95ab). If not properly managed, it’s possible to experience low levels after a cycle.

# 2. Estrogen

When testosterone levels in the body increase, some of it is converted into estrogen through a process called aromatization.

* Water retention
* Fat gain
* Gynecomastia

# 3. Cortisol

Steroids will lower cortisol levels as quickly as possible in order to facilitate faster expansion, but once the cycle is complete, cortisol levels will rebound, and there is a risk of muscle loss if not properly managed.

# 4. LH & FSH

These hormones are responsible for stimulating natural testosterone production in the body. Steroid use will suppress both of those hormones, so having an effective recovery supplement is critical.

# 3. [Key Strategies to Maintain Hormonal Balance During Steroid Use](https://evolvebiolabs.com/blog/10-natural-ways-to-balance-your-hormones/)

# 1. Choose the Right Dosage and Cycle Length

Avoid unnecessarily high doses or extended cycles. Beginners should stick to:

* Mild compounds
* Shorter cycles (6–10 weeks)
* Conservative dosing

# 2. Use Aromatase Inhibitors (AI) Wisely

AIs help control estrogen levels during your cycle. Popular options include:

* Arimidex
* Aromasin

They help prevent estrogen-related side effects, but be careful not to suppress estrogen too much; this can have repercussions on joint health and affect your mood. Always start with lower doses and adjust for your worst symptoms.

# 3. Support Your Liver and Endocrine System

Healthy hormones need a healthy liver. Add these:

* Milk thistle
* TUDCA
* NAC (N-Acetyl Cysteine)

# 4. Prioritize Sleep and Stress Management

Poor sleep and stress increase cortisol, which affects hormone health.

[](https://medium.com/plans?source=upgrade_membership---post_li_non_moc_upsell--d7be339002d0---------------------------------------)

Aim for:

* 7–9 hours of sleep
* Controlled training volume
* Stress-reducing activities like meditation or walking

# 5. Maintain a Hormone-Supportive Diet

Nutrition plays a major role in hormonal stability. Include:

* Healthy fats (avocado, nuts, olive oil)
* Lean protein sources
* Zinc-rich foods (pumpkin seeds, eggs)
* Magnesium and vitamin D
* Plenty of water

# 4. [Post-Cycle Therapy (PCT): The Key to Restoring Hormonal Balance](https://evolvebiolabs.com/blog/post-cycle-therapy-pct-guide-why-its-crucial-how-to-do-it-right/)

Your body requires a period and assistance to restart the natural testosterone production right after the anabolic steroid cycle. Post-Cycle Therapy (PCT) is what makes sense now. Steroids reduce the levels of hormones such as LH and FSH, and without proper measures, the steroid users would suffer from low testosterone, unstable mood, and even loss of muscle gains. PCT stimulates the hormones to return to the baseline and at the same time ensures the long-term health protection.

# Why PCT Is Important

A structured PCT helps prevent or minimize:

* Hormonal crashes after a steroid cycle
* Low testosterone symptoms (fatigue, low libido, weakness)
* Excess estrogen buildup
* Muscle loss due to cortisol rebound
* Mood swings and lack of motivation

# What a Good PCT Should Include

**SERMs (Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators):** Clomid or Nolvadex help promote natural testosterone production.

**Natural testosterone boosters:** Products such as zinc, vitamin D, fenugreek, or ashwagandha will help you achieve hormonal recovery.

**Supplement for Liver Support:** NAC, Milk Thistle, and TUDCA will assist in detoxing and reducing post-cycle stress on liver health.

[**Balanced Nutrition:**](https://medium.com/@evolvebiolab/how-to-manage-hormonal-imbalance-with-exercise-and-nutrition-cb4697621d2a) A proper diet with adequate amounts of protein, healthy fats, and micronutrients can help maintain healthy hormonal structures.

**Light to moderate training:** Training should be dialed back for a couple of weeks at post-cycle to avoid excessive cortisol release.

# 5. Lifestyle Habits That Support Hormonal Health During a Steroid Cycle

It’s not only about supplements and PCT when it comes to maintaining hormonal balance; it is also determined by the daily lifestyle choices to a large extent. Through the practice of small and steady habits, you can contribute, thus making a big difference in stabilizing your hormones and maximizing your cycle results.

# Key habits to follow:

**Prioritize Quality Sleep as a First Priority:** Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep each night to balance testosterone and cortisol.

[**Manage Stress:**](https://medium.com/@emmaswift02/how-to-manage-stress-through-yoga-and-meditation-cc2101309c69) Elevated stress levels increase cortisol, which can upset hormone balance. Meditate, do yoga, or take a short walk.

**Drink Plenty of Water:** Adequate hydration improves metabolism, hormone transport, and recovery.

**Minimize Alcohol and Processed Foods:** A high sugar and alcohol content can affect endocrine function.

**Consistent Exercise Routine:** Use compound lifts and moderate cardio for hormone efficiency.

# Conclusion

It is very important to have proper hormonal balance when using anabolic steroids not only for performance but also for health in the long run. You can get rid of the negative effects and get more muscle mass by managing your cycle in a smart way, nourishing the natural hormone production through the good practice of eating, taking supplements, and post-cycle therapy, and getting into healthy lifestyle routines like having good sleep and handling stress. A good plan guarantees that your body remains strong, your achievements last longer, and your health stays good.

# FAQs

**1. How can I prevent estrogen-related side effects?**

Using aromatase inhibitors (AIs) at the right dosage, maintaining a balanced diet, and monitoring hormone levels can help control estrogen and prevent water retention, gynecomastia, and fat gain.

**2. Can lifestyle habits affect hormonal balance during steroid use?**

Yes. Quality sleep, stress management, hydration, proper nutrition, and a consistent exercise routine all play a crucial role in maintaining healthy hormone levels.

**3. Should I get blood tests while on a steroid cycle?**

Absolutely. Regular blood tests help monitor testosterone, estrogen, liver enzymes, and other hormones. This ensures your cycle is safe and allows timely adjustments to prevent long-term damage.

I was sent into psych ward around 13yo and apparently they clocked me being a weird bitch and my records were riddled with notes abt me being an ”asp\*\*gers-girl”.(their words, def not mine /gen) And the exact same thing in my psychiatrist’s notes. Well eventually I was assessed at 13-14yo. I very vaguely remember the room where i was assessed, a video camera was facing me and some woman sat on the right and another one on the left i think. Eventually we got the verdict which was: ”Patient exceeds in symptoms needed to meet ASD diagnostic criteria, but it has been decided that a diagnosis will not be set at this time”. EHHH??? so BAAAASICALLY you told my parents, ""yeeee this weird bitch autistic as fuuuck bro but hang in there!"" and since I had no dx, my family was not eligible for ASD related support and guidance.

[my hen says you're a fucking wanker, mate](https://preview.redd.it/3fwnrxl6rb5g1.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3af691c137928bef1c479443691b604a2db82b56)

BUT OK SEE I DONT REMEMBER ANYTHING OF THIS. I found this in my records when I ordered them when i was around 20yo.

Fastforward to 2023 spring-summer, my emotionally unavailable prob-not-NT mom divorces my emotionally unavailable ADHD-dad and he decides to pay for an ADHD evaluation from a private ND practioner who used to do them in the public healthcare. Basically, you get evaluated and then that paperwork is brought to a psych/doc and they evaluate the results and then you get (or dont) the dx. *Anyways*, he decided to pay for all that bc ""that surely will make my daughter choose my side!"" WELP, instead of 2-3 appointments, it took 2 MONTHS to evaluate me bc i'm indeed a weird bitch. **Verdict:** *this bitch has hella lot autistic traits but also hella lot  ADHD traits but also is a heavily traumatized so she needs specialized neuropsychiatric evaluation from the* ***Neuropsychiatry consultation outpatient clinic*** ~~(according to google translate)~~*. Oh and she keeps sitting on the carpet and rubbing her limbs on it because ""it feels noice"".* (The lady was btw awesome, def adore her, she delivered the report files to the clinic's secretary herself bc she knew how shite the public healthcare is atp).

Welp, apparently my report files had just sat on some new doc's desk for funsies for months until on 2023 december they decided to put me in queue for the wtv clinic. FASTFORWARD to spring 2024! My evaluation begins in feb 2024 and ends in may 2024. I was evaluated by a group of professionals; the chief psych of the clinic, a neuropsychologist, an ND social worker + occupational therapist, and then a rehabilitation counsellor (according to google translate) interviewed my mom. Initially they were gonna assess both ASD and ADHD, but then the old hag of a neuropsychologist talked to the chief psychiatrist abt, oh she cant be autistic there's no reason to do the ASD assessment SO ***THAT ASSESSMENT WAS SCRAPPED***.

[i'm on my wits end and i dont even have wit!!!!](https://preview.redd.it/mcq813kvub5g1.jpg?width=391&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9aa01646e1e917417fe5361ee7e8621f14dcf1ed)

EH! May 2024 im dx'd with combined type ADHD in the final meeting with the whole group of professionals and in the diagnostic report it says ""must wait until suitable ADHD medication is found which might bring out more ASD symptoms and then she can be re-assessed if that would occur"". WHICH IS FACTUALLY CORRECT, HOWEVER, I AM ON MY SECOND LAST ADHD MED OPTION LEFT NOW IN DEC 2025 AND EVEN IT DOESNT WORK!!!! (vyvanse/elvanse). but FUCK do you know about my ASD symptoms when you didnt even FUCKING ASSESS MEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!

And not only THAT, the neuropsych's reasoning for the scrapping of the ASD assessment was. ""you can hold eyecontact"". ""you have humor"". ""you have good social skills"". ""you don't have special interests"". ""your symptoms could very well be ADHD instead"". but i mask i mask i mask i mask. I was CONDITIONED to mask not only by the environment but by my PARENTS. ""Don't do that"". ""aren't you ashamed of yourself"". ""im ashamed to be seen in public with you when you act like that"". ""stop doing that"". ""you're being so overdramatic"". ""LOOK ME IN THE EYES"". ""don't act stupid! YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I JUST ASKED YOU.""  
and the classic hisses through the teeth: ""*stop it, i said,* ***~~STOP IT~~***"", ""go talk to your cousins! i said ***go,*** *don't be a rude guest, you need to represent our family*"". ""why are you alone in the kitchen, you must be here with the guests"". ""why are you being so difficult!!"".

AAANYWAYS! It's dec 2025, i'm finally in therapy with a lovely psychotherapist who specializes in trauma/dissociation and also neurodivergence esp ASD and ADHD peeps. She has said that i'm a classic case of afab autism. And recently we've been watching a training seminar made for healthcare professionals about afab ASD. I don't know whether laugh or cry when watching it or even thinking about it. I see myself in every elaboration, in every powerpoint slide, in every example.

*And I want to scream so fucking bad.*

I soak thru ultra size tampon with back up period underwear and fill up a menstrual cup in ten minutes to the top with blood 😭 this is why I will be getting a much needed hysterectomy.

Perspektivlosigkeit/Verzweiflung nach Kündigung bzw. bei der Stellensuche,"Da ich aktuell an einem Punkt im Leben stehe, an welchem ich nicht wirklich weiß, wie und ob es weitergehen wird, erhoffe ich mir von diesem Post den ein oder anderen Ratschlag, um wieder etwas Licht am Ende des Tunnels zu sehen.

Kurz die wichtigsten Infos über mich und den Grund des Posts:

43 Jahre alt, abgeschlossene IHK-Ausbildung zum IT-System-Kaufmann, Mittlere Reife, kein Studium, keine Weiterbildungen, keine Zertifikate.

Ende August wurde ich, nach fast 17 Jahren Betriebszugehörigkeit, völlig unerwartet betriebsbedingt gekündigt und bin seitdem (unter Lohnfortzahlung) freigestellt, bis ich ab 01.03.26 endgültig arbeitslos wäre. Die exakte Story hierzu gibt’s hier:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/LegaladviceGerman/comments/1n2dmbt/ordentliche\_k%C3%BCndigung\_mit\_freistellung\_aus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegaladviceGerman/comments/1n2dmbt/ordentliche_k%C3%BCndigung_mit_freistellung_aus/)

Der Schock über die ganze Sache ist noch immer nicht wirklich überwunden. Trotzdem war ich in der Zwischenzeit natürlich bei der Agentur für Arbeit. Dieser Besuch war sehr ernüchternd. Wirkliche Hilfe oder gar passende Stellenangebote erhoffe ich mir hierdurch nicht. Nur Forderungen und was ich alles zu erfüllen hätte bei der Jobsuche gab’s genug – nach diesem Besuch fühlte ich mich noch minderwertiger als eh schon.

Zusätzlich habe ich ein privates Bewerbungscoaching in Anspruch genommen, um mir eine(n) aktuelle Bewerbung/Lebenslauf erstellen zu lassen und mich auf den anstehenden Bewerbungsprozess vorzubereiten.

Die letzten paar Wochen habe ich dann so wirklich mit der Jobsuche und ersten Bewerbungen begonnen – mit großer Ernüchterung. Nichts passt so wirklich auf mein Profil/Können. Klar, Stellenausschreibungen fordern immer mehr, als dann eigentlich benötigt wird, aber ehrlich gesagt erfülle ich so gut wie keinen einzigen Punkt bei diesen ganzen Ausschreibungen.

Was kann ich eigentlich bzw. habe ich die letzten 17 Jahre so gemacht? Kurze Antwort: Alles. Lange Antwort: Ich war in einem absoluten „IT“-Nischensektor tätig (digitale Diktiersysteme und Spracherkennungssoftware), in welchem es in Deutschland eine Handvoll ernstzunehmender Händler gibt.

Wir haben Standardsoftware und dazu passende Hardware wie Diktiergeräte und Mikrofone vertrieben, was gefühlt jeder nach etwas Einarbeitungszeit kann. Ich habe, wie oben geschrieben, alles gemacht: Beratung und Vertrieb, „Projektmanagement“, Installation/Konfiguration, „Consulting“, Workshops, technischen Support, allgemeine Bürotätigkeiten.

Das liest sich soweit alles ganz gut, man muss aber dazu sagen, dass ich in einer „winzigen Klitsche“ tätig war. Sprich eine Arbeit nach gängigen Standards oder mit gängigen Tools gab’s nicht. Alles wurde „irgendwie“ gemacht, was, in dieser Nische, auch ganz gut geklappt hat. Fort-/Weiterbildungen? Was ist das. Zertifikate? Für was. Du brauchst \`nen Mailclient? Hier gibt’s Thunderbird. Router am Arsch? Kauf‘ den billigsten von Amazon.

Ich denke in welcher Art von Firma ich unterwegs war, ist hieran ganz gut zu sehen. Lange Rede, kurzer Sinn: Mein ganzes Leben war auf diese Stelle aufgebaut und ich habe auch fest damit gerechnet, beim genannten Arbeitgeber in Rente zu gehen (das wurde mir auch immer wieder in Aussicht gestellt).

Kurz vor der Kündigung habe ich noch eine neue Wohnung bezogen, welche deutlich teurer als meine alte war und ich mir nur durch mein „ganz gutes“ Gehalt leisten konnte. Wo wir dabei sind: Ich habe im Schnitt um die 3000,- € netto verdient – mal mehr, mal weniger, da es zusätzlich zum Fixgehalt eine Provisionsregelung gab. Zudem drei Tage Homeoffice, generell kein Stress, lockerer Job. Ich habe mich einfach ZU sicher gefühlt und bekomme das jetzt mit aller Gewalt zurück.

Theoretisch kann ich einige Zeit finanziell gut überbrücken, da ich schon immer gut mit Geld umgehen konnte, aber das ist ja nicht Sinn der Sache. Das Arbeitslosengeld, welches ich bekommen würde, reicht gerade so für meine Fixkosten.

Zusammenfassend fühle ich mich auf dem aktuellen Arbeitsmarkt komplett fehl am Platz. Ich habe zwar langjährige Erfahrung in einem Nischensektor und grundlegende IT-Kenntnisse, aber keinerlei Fortbildungen oder Zertifikate. Zudem bin ich mit 43 nicht mehr der Jüngste und kann auch (auf längere Sicht) nicht für 1800,- € netto arbeiten. Ich kann alles „ein Bisschen“, aber nichts so wirklich gut.

Auf erste Bewerbungen gab es, wenn überhaupt, nur Absagen (ich bewerbe mich z. B. auf Vertriebsinnendienststellen, Systemhausjobs, eben ähnlicher Aufgabenbereich wie bisher). Mir liegt die Beratung von Kunden und die technische Umsetzung – auch Schulungen halte ich gerne bzw. mag es, Menschen etwas beizubringen, was ich selbst gut kann.

Aktuell sehe ich mich aber in 1-2 Jahren eher Burger braten oder Regale einräumen, wenn mein aktueller Lebenswille überhaupt so lange durchhalten sollte (die Kündigung ist nur das i-Tüpfelchen auf einem Leben, welches die letzten Jahre in vielen Bereichen nur nach unten geht).

Wie komme ich raus aus diesem Loch und was kann ich tun? Was würdet ihr tun?

Vielen Dank für etwas Input, gerne auch von Personen, die evtl. etwas in dieser Art durchgemacht haben.

PS: Generell bin ich auch offen für einen kompletten Neustart in einem ganz anderen Bereich/Tätigkeitsumfeld – ich muss nicht reich werden, nur einigermaßen gut leben können.",tomtomw,1peo3wy,Ratschlag,05-12-2025,07:36:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ratschlag/comments/1peo3wy/perspektivlosigkeitverzweiflung_nach_kündigung/
Construction Invoice Disputed,"Kia ora,
 
Im sorry if this is messy. I'm all over the place. 

I’m looking for guidance on where to start with a situation involving my former small business. I have recently taken up a full-time job just to get rent paid and find stability, and now I’m trying to understand how to manage this issue properly.
 
My former business (not trading, still LLC registered) completed ADDITIONAL work for a client after the end date of their original purchase order. The client is the same trade as myself, and he is effectively a consultant in security who has a large client he has ongoing work for. He directly asked me to find more labour through Whatsapp messages, and in short - I invoiced for approx. 40k after verbally being asked to reduce the initial 50k rough estimate I gave him. The client is refusing to pay due to complaints about delays and issues earlier in January–February, which he are trying to blame me. I have mounts of proof that I am not to blame and infact, I raised most of those concerns to him and he did not come to the party.

Initially, as part of the original PO (26k, paid in drips and drabs) I was hired as a technician initially to help on a multi-million dollar project. 2 weeks into accepting the offer we realize his cabling team have messed up. He fires them and asks me if I can source labour for 600 hours of work. I seek and find (PO 76k total), so im clipping the ticket. My resources invoice me, I invoice client. Throughout the course of the project the client pulls himself off the project and goes home to Queenstown. At the same time he pulls the only qualified tech off the job too. Leaving me with my resources, severely under qualified for project managing such a large job and being the ONLY certified technician. This was not the initial agreement. I carried the weight anyway, as I was promised more work and life changing future (this was one of a large list of projects to come) so I obeyed.
 
Back to the dispute.. the additional 40k invoice remains unpaid, I haven’t been able to pay subcontractors who worked on that March scope. Some of them have now engaged debt collectors and issued formal demands to me as the director of the company. One entered into a settlement deed with me, but I couldn’t meet the initial deposit on time and now face the risk of court action. Personally liable. I sent him a letter of demand. He said go ahead, and threw a load of reasons at me that I genuinely am not responsible for, in my opinion.
 
I'm absolutely depleted. Unrelated but my fiance has also split with me due to the stress I'm wearing. I agree it's not fair on our 2 year old but now I'm beyond help mentally with this. This situation is the cause of my breakdown , and I've let my family suffer and shatter.

Any guidance on where to begin would be hugely appreciated. I am severely lost right now. 2 lawyers I spoke to were very interested but wanted 5k roughly. I am broke. I can't pay that. 

Thanks in advance ",dankyousomuchh,1peo1rw,LegalAdviceNZ,05-12-2025,07:32:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceNZ/comments/1peo1rw/construction_invoice_disputed/
Rapid Aquisition (aka Load Platinum Bars guide),"To preface this, I was getting frustrated with this mission. My team of Super Privates were getting wiped game after game.

So I consulted the brudder himself (OhDough) to see what he was doing. Dough was spamming Jump Pack with smokes, solo. I'm not that good, nor interested in doing something that tedious.

I've been joining or starting lobbies with randoms and advising one thing: Bring Gas Resist armor (Chemical Agents, Killzone, Dust Devils).

I prefer Lockdown (Heavy Chemical Agents) as it provides 100% gas resistance.

The loadout:
Orbital Smoke, Gas Mines, EAT-17, Thermite.

Step 1: Call in the container

Step 2: Gas Mines

Step 3: Orbital Smoke

Step 4: Load the Platinum

Repeat from Step 2

I prefer Eagle Strafing run for a quick path clear, or to deal with Factory Striders. Call in EAT-17s to deal with Warstriders and Hulks, or toss Thermites.

Randoms who join you, who don't wear Gas Resist will motherf**k you. People who listen and wear Gas Resist armor will praise you.

Primary weapons: Anything with crowd control. Punisher Plasma, Purifier, Crossbow, Eruptor.
Secondary: To taste. I like Ultimatum and Talon.

"RBI cuts repo rate by .25 BPS , will you get the benefit? Heres an advice from my side for people with home loans and people looking for the home loans","I am a loan consultant from mumbai having tie ups with 60+ banks. Heres my advice 

- People with loan running currently

Keep tracking your rate if your rate isnt changed within 3 months then most probably bank is stealing from you. Heres what you can do if they dont change even after your followup go to another bank take a sanction from that bank and threaten them that you will do balance transfer 

Who will get the benefit?
Loans linked to Repo rate ( RBLR) , If its linked to repo but its RLLR most common in the case of BOB it will depend on your cibil too and upto bank if they have to pass the benefit or not. Also if you reset date is quarterly you will get benefits as per your reset date 

Who will not get benefit?
Loans not linked to repo rate mostly in the case of NBFC , so keep a check and threaten them with balance transfer if they dont pass on the benefit

- People looking for a home loan 

So if you are someone who is looking for a loan and has a sanction letter better to disburse the loan within 14 days  or before the bank implements new rates ( mostly it takes 14 days ). If you are lucky you might get the benefit",Lamesarcasm_Dankmind,1penzef,Chembur,05-12-2025,07:28:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chembur/comments/1penzef/rbi_cuts_repo_rate_by_25_bps_will_you_get_the/
Old PIP applied to a new position after FMLA leave — is this legal?,"Hey everyone!

I’m looking for some outside perspective on a workplace situation that feels… off. I’m keeping details vague for privacy.

Earlier this year, I was working as an Board Liason supporting my org. I asked for a raise, and about a week later I was unexpectedly placed on a PIP. Around the same time, I reported repeated disrespect/unprofessional behavior from another director and a coworker to HR.

Not long after, I went on FMLA leave for medical reasons. When I returned, I was told my position had been “eliminated” and was offered a completely different role with a very different scope. I was also told that the PIP from my old position would carry over into the new role.

This feels strange to me, since the new job has different responsibilities and expectations. I’m worried the PIP is being used as justification to treat me differently or set me up for failure, even though the role isn’t the one I originally had performance concerns about. I haven’t accepted the new position yet because I’m trying to understand my rights. 

I’m trying to figure out:

- Can a PIP from a previous role carry over into a newly assigned role with different duties?
- Does the timing (raise request → PIP → reporting issues → FMLA → role eliminated) raise any red flags?
- What steps should I take to protect myself legally and professionally?
- Any advice on how to document everything effectively?

I’m planning to consult with an employment attorney, but I’d love to hear from anyone who has been through something similar or works in HR.

Thanks in advance.

Academic transcript vs grade sheet (NEB Nepal),"So I applied to HKBU and I had attached my academic transcript of my SLC (grade 12) in the portal.

Today, they mailed me back saying the other applicants who appeared on SLC had uploaded grade sheet and asked me to consult my counselor. Now I am confused. What should I do in this case?

How reading body language made social anxiety vanish (and boosted likeability fast),"Ever felt like someone didn’t like you but you couldn’t explain why? Or left a conversation just replaying it in your head over and over because something felt… off? Same. I used to be totally unaware of how much I was missing in social interactions until I realized most communication isn’t even spoken. After diving deep into books, behavioral research, and expert interviews, I finally figured out this silent language everyone else seemed fluent in. It wasn’t my personality, it wasn’t social anxiety, I just didn’t know how to read the room.

This post isn’t coming from a “former FBI agent turned dating coach” trying to sell you a course. It’s just real insights I picked up after getting tired of being socially oblivious. I’ve curated the best practical advice from real research, bestselling books, and longtime behavioral experts that will help you spot hidden emotions, detect lies, build instant trust, and be way more magnetic in every interaction. It’s the stuff you won’t learn from TikTok influencers spouting random “alpha” energy BS.

Here’s the straight-up, no-BS breakdown of what actually works if you want to learn to read people better, and become 10x more effective and confident in social life.

1. **Learn the baseline**  
Before you interpret any body language, you need to understand someone’s “normal.” Human behavior expert Joe Navarro (former FBI agent and author of *What Every Body Is Saying*) emphasizes this in all his work. Is that person usually jittery or calm? Do they speak fast or slow? You can’t decode “lies” or “attraction” if you don’t even know how they usually act.

2. **Pay attention to clusters, not isolated cues**  
One action means nothing. But three things at once, crossed arms, avoiding eye contact, and leaning away, likely means discomfort. Harvard psychologist Amy Cuddy also backs this in her TED Talk, noting that “body language signals” need context. Look for patterns of behavior, not one-off movements.

3. **Pupils tell secrets**  
When someone is really interested or emotionally stimulated, their pupils dilate. It’s subtle, but it’s one of the most involuntary reactions we have. According to a 2006 study published by the Association for Psychological Science, pupil dilation is a reliable sign of attention and arousal. It happens before we’re even aware of it.

4. **Feet never lie**  
People’s feet will usually point toward what they want. During a conversation, if someone’s torso is facing you but their feet are pointing toward the door, they’re mentally checking out. This is a trick used in law enforcement interviews (Navarro mentions this in multiple talks), but it also applies to casual social or dating settings.

5. **Master the “eyebrow flash”**  
A quick raising of the eyebrows (less than one second) is a universal sign of recognition and interest. It’s automatic, and it also builds connection. Behavioral scientists at the University of British Columbia found this facial cue appears across nearly all cultures and is linked to openness and friendliness.

6. **Learn the difference between social anxiety and disinterest**  
Don’t mistake fidgeting or lack of eye contact for dislike. Some people are genuinely nervous or neurodivergent. What matters is how their cues change over time. If they gradually open up, that’s a good sign. If they stay closed off, maybe it’s time to disengage without overthinking it.

7. **Keep your own body language open and calm**  
You're not just decoding others, you're also transmitting. According to research published in the European Journal of Social Psychology, people unconsciously mimic the body language of those they like. Keep your posture relaxed, uncrossed, and lean slightly in. It encourages connection and safety.

8. **Pause more. Speak less**  
Pausing gives you a chance to observe. It also signals confidence. Over-talking usually comes from nervousness. FBI negotiators use silence as a tool, it makes people reveal more than they intended. Use it in everyday conversation and you’ll start noticing the real story under the words.

---

Now if you’re serious about getting better, here are some ridiculously helpful resources that changed everything for me:

1. **What Every Body Is Saying by Joe Navarro**  
Written by a former FBI counterintelligence agent. This book will make you see people differently forever. Navarro breaks down gestures, micro-expressions, and intent in a way that’s clear and immediately useful. It’s the most practical guide on nonverbal communication I’ve ever read. Honestly, this book made me feel like I leveled up socially overnight. This is the best body language book for beginners and beyond.

2. **The Definitive Book of Body Language by Allan and Barbara Pease**  
This one’s more fun and broad. It’s packed with diagrams, day-to-day examples, and even dating-specific cues. Barbara Pease is a body language consultant used by major corporations, and Allan worked in sales psychology. It’s entertaining and scarily accurate. This book will make you question everything you believe people meant in convos.

3. **The Like Switch by Jack Schafer**  
Written by another ex-FBI agent who specialized in getting spies to cooperate. It teaches you how to build rapport quickly, even with people who aren’t naturally warm. Schafer’s “friendship formula” (proximity, frequency, duration, and intensity) is a cheat code to becoming more likable with strangers and colleagues. Insanely good read if you want to influence outcomes socially without being manipulative.

4. **The Behavioral Arts** YouTube channel  
Run by behavior analyst Spidey, this channel is full of breakdowns of interviews, celebrity lie detection, and clear how-to videos for reading microexpressions. Super accessible, bingeable, and surprisingly accurate. Think body language meets true crime.

5. **BeFreed** – a personalized audio learning app like Duolingo x MasterClass (with a super smart avatar called Freedia), recently went viral on X for a reason. Built by a team from Columbia and ex-Google folks, it turns expert research, books, and talks into personalized podcast-style lessons. 

I use it to go deep into body language, social intelligence, and persuasion, just typed in “how to read people better” and it built me a full adaptive learning path. You can even choose the tone and voice (mine’s this chill, confident narrator that almost feels like a coach). It’s helped me replace mindless scrolling with legit insight, and I’ve been communicating way more clearly at work and socially.

6. **Hidden Brain** podcast by Shankar Vedantam  
This NPR podcast dives into the stories behind human behavior. Not just body language, but why we react a certain way in social settings and what our subconscious is really doing. Episode rec: “The Influence You Have” talks about how unaware we are of the vibes we give off.

7. **The Nonverbal Group** website  
They’re a research-based consultancy that breaks down how body language affects workplace dynamics, dating, and leadership. Some of their case studies are wild. They offer free content and video analysis that is better than most paid courses.

8. **Video app: Videoleap**  
Start filming yourself in mock conversations to review your posture, eye contact, facial expressions. You’ll cringe, but it’s the fastest way to spot weird habits you didn’t even know you had. Athletes watch game footage, why shouldn’t you?

9. **Mental exercise app: NeuroNation**

**CHAPTER 1: GALACTIC DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH**

**Section 4. Establishment of the Galactic Department of Health**

(a) Establishment.—There is established the Galactic Department of Health (GDOH), an independent agency operating as a single-payer system for qualified individuals.

(b) Coverage.—Beginning January 1, 2027, GDOH shall provide zero-out-of-pocket coverage for all medically
necessary services, including:
(1) Hospital inpatient and outpatient care.
(2) Physician and specialist services.
(3) Mental health and substance use disorder treatment.
(4) Dental, vision, and hearing services.
(5) Prescription drugs and biologics.
(6) Rehabilitative and habilitative services.

(c) Phased Rollout with State Pilots.—Full national implementation shall commence on January 1, 2032. Prior thereto, up to 20 voluntary state pilots, selected for diversity in population size, urban-rural mix, and political lean, shall be authorized under Medicaid Section 1115 waivers, assessing costs and reimbursements over 1-10
years. Pilots shall test zero-out-of-pocket coverage for subsets of qualified individuals (e.g., children and elderly first), funded by up to 0.2 percent of the prior fiscal year's federal health expenditures redirected from Affordable Care Act subsidies, while enforcing anti-rationing provisions and performance metrics targeting health spending below 9 percent of gross domestic product. Pilots shall achieve at least 90
percent enrollment, denials below 2 percent, and spending equivalent to below 12 percent of gross
domestic product, with quarterly interim reports from the Congressional Budget Office and the Government Accountability Office, including automatic adjustments such as up to 10 percent additional funding if outcomes lag. Data from pilots shall inform surpluses via the Policy Simulator under section 20, addressing federal
overreach concerns while preserving automatic enrollment nationwide post-pilot.

(d) Anti-Rationing Guarantee.—
(1) The Galactic Department of Health may not deny or delay any medically necessary service to a qualified individual under age 75 that credible peer-reviewed evidence shows has at least a 65 percent probability of extending healthy lifespan by 3 or more years or restoring capacity for work or for independent living.
(2) All such services shall be funded through a dedicated High-Value Care Account that may not exceed 5 percent of total annual GDOH expenditures in any fiscal year.
(3) If projected demand exceeds the Account limit, the Secretary shall prioritize services by the ratio of expected healthy years gained to incremental cost and publish the ranked list 90 days before the fiscal year. Any service ranked in the top 80 percent of cost-effectiveness shall remain fully covered.

(e) Enrollment.—Automatic enrollment for all qualified individuals, with opt-out options under section 5.

(f) Integration of Social Security.—Existing Social Security accounts are grandfathered, with benefits payable as under current law. New accounts may be created, but funding shall derive from the National Health and
Longevity Trust Fund, including payroll contributions and surplus dividends allocated under this Act, with a fiscal bridge fund equivalent to 0.1 percent of the prior fiscal year's federal health expenditures for the first five years to cover overlaps during payroll shifts.

**CHAPTER 2: OPT-OUT PROVISIONS AND VOUCHER SYSTEM**

**Section 5. Opt-Out Provisions and Voucher System**

(a) Opt-Out Eligibility.—Qualified individuals may opt out of GDOH coverage annually, receiving a risk-adjusted voucher equivalent to up to 125 percent of per-capita GDOH spending for high-risk or older individuals, with annual recoupment of unused funds exceeding 20 percent.

(b) Voucher Use.—Vouchers may fund:
(1) Private health plans.
(2) Health savings accounts.
(3) Direct primary care arrangements.
(4) Cash pooling for catastrophic coverage.

(c) Private Plan Restrictions.—Private plans funded by vouchers are limited to 2 percent administrative and 5 percent profit margins. Re-enrollment in GDOH is penalty-free. Opt-out rates shall be tracked as a determinable
outcome metric with a target below 10 percent.

**TITLE III: FUNDING AND TRANSITION**

**CHAPTER 1: FUNDING MECHANISMS AND TRANSITION**

**Section 6. Funding Mechanisms and Transition**

(a) National Health and Longevity Trust Fund.—All revenues under this section shall be deposited into a dedicated National Health and Longevity Trust Fund.

(b) Transition Phase (Fiscal Years 2027–2036).—Funding sourced from:
(1) Redirection of existing federal health expenditures (Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, VA, ACA, etc.).
(2) Employer and employee health premiums converted to payroll contributions.
(3) Revenue-neutral tax adjustments to maintain net taxpayer burden, including phase-in of the 1 percent
financial transaction tax on trades exceeding $1 million via reconciliation.
(4) Temporary high-cost reinsurance pool for claims exceeding 0.05 percent of gross domestic product per enrollee per year during the transition phase, funded exclusively by the National Health and Longevity Trust Fund and modeled on the successful Affordable Care Act transitional reinsurance program and state 1332
waiver reinsurance programs.
(5) Disproportionate share hospital and graduate medical education funds following patients to ease provider transition.
(6) Consolidation of nutrition and social determinants programs.—Effective January 1, 2028, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), school lunch and breakfast programs under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, the Emergency Food Assistance Program, and all discretionary and block-grant programs administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (other than those already transferred under paragraphs (1)–(5)) shall be transferred to and administered by the Galactic Department of Health as part of the National Health and Longevity Trust Fund. Such programs shall be reformed and integrated as evidence-based social-determinants-of-health interventions, with eligibility automatically aligned to GDOH enrollment and benefits expanded to include preventive nutrition, housing supports, and broadband access where demonstrated to reduce total cost of care by at least 5 percent per enrollee cohort, as verified annually by the Policy Simulator.

(c) Ongoing Funding (Phased to Fiscal Year 2047).—Sources include:
(1) Payroll taxes as specified in subsection (e).
(2) Federal health program budgets.
(3) Most-favored-nation-minus-20 percent pricing for pharmaceuticals through GDOH contracts.
(4) A 1 percent financial transaction tax reallocation on trades exceeding $1 million.
(5) Reallocated Excise taxes on luxury goods and unhealthy products.
(6) 12 percent of import tariffs.

(d) Fiscal Circuit Breakers.—If expenditures exceed 13 percent of gross domestic product, tax rates freeze until compliance. Surpluses trigger automatic tax reductions (e.g., 1 percentage point cut to top marginal income tax rate per surplus equivalent to 0.6 percent of gross domestic product). If surpluses exceed 0.2 percent of gross domestic product, up to 20 percent shall be allocated to provider bonuses for improved outcomes.

(e) Payroll Tax Cap and Allocation.—The total combined payroll tax rate (including employer and employee shares) shall be capped at 15 percent. Of this 15 percent, 45 percent shall be dedicated to the National Health and Longevity Trust Fund for health, longevity, and integrated Social Security purposes, with 27.5 percent allocated to the federal general fund and 27.5 percent to state general funds.
The combined payroll contribution under this subsection shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of any existing taxes under sections 3101 and 3111 of the Internal Revenue Code and by the actuarial value of employer-sponsored health premiums paid in the prior taxable year, ensuring no net increase in combined payroll burden for at least 95 percent of households and businesses in any income quintile, as verified annually by the Congressional Budget Office.”
This cap and allocation shall be phased in over four years following the date of enactment, with exemptions for income below 0.05 percent of gross domestic product per capita and 50 percent rebates to low earners via Earned Income Tax Credit expansion. All sources under subsections (b) and (c) shall be pre-scored by the Congressional Budget Office within 90 days of enactment, with alternatives triggered if shortfalls exceed 10 percent of projections.

**CHAPTER 2: PRIVATE INSURANCE TRANSITION AND SUPPLEMENTAL OPTIONS**

**Section 7. Private Insurance Transition and Supplemental Options**

(a) Transition.—No new duplicative private policies may be issued after 540 days post-enactment. Existing policies are grandfathered for up to 7 years in cohorts with satisfaction rates exceeding 80 percent per
Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems surveys, with up to 0.2 percent of the prior fiscal year's federal health expenditures allocated as a retraining fund for displaced workers.

(b) Supplemental Insurance.—Unrestricted for non-duplicative benefits. Private carriers may contract with GDOH at fees not exceeding 6.5 percent.

(c) Employer Plans.—Employers may offer supplemental insurance or contribute to vouchers.

Is it a violation of our renter's rights that they still haven't finished our floors and we moved in six months ago?,"Me and my three roommates moved into a place in LA county, California six months ago. When we toured the place, the floors weren't finished and our leasing agent assured us they would be sealed before we moved in. (for context of what I mean when I say unfinished, the hard wood floors are completely raw wood and have water damage in every corner). When we arrived to move in, not only were the floors not sealed, but the place wasn't even cleaned. We submitted 5 maintenance requests (because the first four mysteriously disappeared). It has now been six months and they never fixed the floors. This nice family moved in next door in the same exact complex as us and their floors were also originally unfinished but they had them sealed before that family moved in. Do they not take us seriously because we're younger, all women, or both? Both men I have spoken to at the complex, including our leasing agent, were outwardly sexist, unprofessional, and so disrespectful they made my roommate cry (and this is a girl who woke up at 6am the weekend we were moving to bake her friend a birthday cake, no way in hell she deserved that). My question is, is this a violation of our renter's rights? It feels like it should be but I'm not sure. I've reached a breaking point where if it did violate something that we are actually protected from as renters, I would pay to consult a lawyer because the treatment we have received from this complex is unacceptable. Any advice or lawyer recs in the LA county area would be appreciated!",Appropriate_Poem_441,1penvzs,Renters,05-12-2025,07:23:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Renters/comments/1penvzs/is_it_a_violation_of_our_renters_rights_that_they/
Is it normal that I already received a prescription within my first visit?,"I just had my initial consultation with a psychiatrist looking for a diagnostic evaluation. I'm already kind of expecting it to be something within the BPD spectrum, since l've had a number of episodes of impulsive aggression (which feels like an adrenaline surge) and before I could even think, I'm already reacting physically whenever I hear or encounter something that triggers me.

After our comprehensive intake session, I was diagnosed with MDD and BPD, along with severe bulimia. I'm honestly not surprised with the evaluation, since my OB is the one that gave me a heads up that I should get myself checked for clinical depression. She referred me because l've been showing symptoms that are already beyond Postpartum depression following a miscarriage.

Although I believe that the diagnosis does seem accurate naman, is it normal to be prescribed medication within the first visit? Isn't it too soon to have a prescription? I kind of regret that I already purchased two weeks worth kaagad. Not only they're expensive, now I'm hesitant to start taking it kasi baka it may not actually be for me pala, or maybe even have unbearable side effects.

Job Application Process,"Hi all,  
I’m looking for some guidance about the Telstra recruitment process because I’m a bit confused about what’s happening with my applications.

**🗓️ 27 November 2025**  
I applied for the **Telstra Retail: Customer Service & Sales Consultant** role.

**🗓️ 28 November 2025**  
I received an invitation to complete the HireVue video interview, which I submitted the same day.

**🗓️ 29 November 2025**  
I applied for two more roles:

* **Full Time Customer Service & Sales Consultant – Booragoon**
* **Telstra Retail: Full Time Customer Service & Sales Consultant – Booragoon**

Later that day, I received an email confirming that Telstra had already received my HireVue interview, so I wouldn’t need to complete a second or third one for the additional applications.

**🗓️ 4 December 2025**  
I checked my candidate portal and saw that the application for **Telstra Retail: Full Time Customer Service and Sales Consultant – Booragoon (applied 29 Nov)** was marked **“Application Unsuccessful.”**  
I was never contacted for a phone interview or in-person interview for this role before it was declined.

The other two applications (from **27 Nov** and **29 Nov**) still say **“Application in Consideration.”**  
These roles are also still open, whereas the one I was declined for has closed.

Scared to touch a 4 month old scar,"Heyoo! I had a lipoma on my left side lower ribs area for like 2-3 years. For the longest time I thought it was just how my body was shaped, but then I noticed it was alittle bigger in July so I scheduled a consultation about it. Best medical experience I’ve ever had btw, didnt know I was going to get surgery that day but he took one look at me and went “We will have you out of here in like a half hour, you want that out now?” I took that offer and they took a palm sized mass out of my side, as they were doing it he actually went “wow thats alot bigger than I was expecting.” Took great care of me, super nice, and got me up and out of there fast.
Anyways- I healed with no complications, but I have a thick dark scar now. It looks fine, I dont think its ugly or anything and I have plenty of scars. As these past few months have gone by, I realized I am actually kind of terrified of this scar, like I know its healed, it wont hurt me, I wont hurt it, but I cant touch it. I mean, I can, but I hate touching it. Makes me queasy. I hate the thought of a scalpel being in there and digging around, even though I didnt feel a thing and honestly had a great time during the surgery talking to the nurses. I feel like I can feel it still though sometimes. Like the pressure. And I go and touch the scar and I feel like I’m going to hurt it by touching it, even though I know I wont. I dont really touch it at all unless I’m in the shower, and even then I barely touch it. My boyfriend will touch it and I flinch but not as much as I do when I touch it. Its weird. Im scared to lay on my side sometimes, and it definitely feels different since I was so used to it being there. I dont like the sensation. And sometimes I feel a little tingling sensation, its not painful or anything, I read that could be nerve damage from the surgery? 
I do not miss the damn thing, I’m so happy its gone and I’m not in pain, but man this scar intimidates me. Which is really funny to me because I am a tattoo artist right, and I saw human suspension for the first time live at a show AFTER this surgery, and I was like “wow thats amazing I want to do that” but literally like a week ago I got the ick from touching my scar, and went “yeah no I wont be doing that now.”",capndanpan,1penptz,Lipoma,05-12-2025,07:13:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lipoma/comments/1penptz/scared_to_touch_a_4_month_old_scar/
Foreigner at a Japan Concert,"Before I start, I just wanted to say I had a great time at the concert and it was nice seeing songs they usually don’t see! It’s not a diss on Japan as a country or Japanese people, this is MY experience. I would just like to let other foreigners to be cautious of when they go to these concerts.

So I’m an exchange student for a semester in Japan. I’m an African American woman. At this point I’m used to the stares and being treated like a foreigner. So I ended going with a Japanese friend to Osaka Day 1, and I’m so grateful I can go with her!

The vibes are different than the Kpop concerts I went to in America, like they’re not as talkative and that’s just a culture thing. Which is fine, that’s not why I came to the concert.

So prior to the concert, I looked up concert etiquette for Japanese concerts. I saw a few things, took note and even asked my friend just so I can have clarity. Generally, I’m not a bad audience member. I cheer when everyone cheers, sing a long, I don’t scream a lot.

So the show starts, and we’re about 5-6 songs in, and I see this woman just keep looking back at me and a few other girls in my row. We’ve been singing every song, just having fun. I wouldn’t say we’re yelling at the top of our lungs, just singing how you normally would at a concert. So she starts talking to the lady next to her (which she doesn’t know), and they start talking about how loud we are (in Japanese). Then the lady in front of me, asks the lady next to me if I’m bothering her, and she goes “yes, she’s so loud.” So this whole time, they don’t know I can understand them, so they’re just talking. One of the ladies gets up, and I’m thinking nothing of it, just thinking she’s going to the bathroom. 

Then, I get a tap on my shoulder. I turn around and it’s the staff showing me a message on their phone: “people around have been complaining you’re too loud. Please quiet down and be respectful of others.” So my first initial thought is “what the f*** are we talking about???!” I’m at a concert, people are going to sing, do the fan chants, etc. I just want to note again, that I was not screaming excessively, not screaming when it was silent, and singing at a respectful volume. So I just turn back around, cause I was so confused. I look around to see if the girls next to me or the girl that’s been screaming her lungs out the past 10 mins for Vernon got talked to, and guess what? They didn’t! They were Japanese, so of course it’s okay for them to do it. So this isn’t even the worst part.

So, the lady that “told on me” came back to her seat, with a smug look, and just stared at me again. I didn’t break eye contact, cause I really wanted to know what the issue was. She must’ve felt intimidated because she immediately looked away. She goes to the lady next to her “I told the staff that she was being too loud.” And they started talking again, and at the end of the sentence I hear “バカ黒人“ (baka kokujin). This means stupid black person/n-word in Japanese (I’ve been told it can mean both, depends on the context). So I immediately freeze up because, are we actually serious?? It’s not that serious, we’re at a concert! People are going to sing, people are going to yell, we’re here to have fun! This isn’t a school assembly. What hurt the most, is that I couldn’t even consult in anybody (my friend didn’t know what was going on) and I didn’t even have the words or just wasn’t quick enough to address the situation. I was also very upset that they had to be cowards about it, couldn’t tell me directly and talked right in front of me about me.

I was immediately irritated because obviously I was hurt, but for someone to make themselves mad because someone else is having a good time, like get a grip. And I’ve been planning this concert since the dates were released and it’s such a pain to get tickets, so for it to be ruined just like that was very disappointing. And concerts are supposed to be a safe space to have fun and enjoy what we all have in common, music and SVT.

I made this post to tell any foreigners (especially Westerners or people who are a different skin color than the Japanese) to be cautious at SVT’s concerts. Just as a foreigner, you automatically have a target on your back unfortunately. I’m not making this to gain sympathy, I just want to share my experience and let other foreigners know to be careful. Whatever you think is okay to do at a concert, dial it back 10x, cause someone is always going to have an issue with you.

What Common Mistakes Do Boards Make Before Consulting an HOA Litigation Lawyer in Miami?,"When a homeowners’ association (HOA) or condominium community in Miami faces disputes whether over dues collection, rule enforcement, governing-document interpretation, or maintenance obligations the right legal representation can make the difference between swift resolution and drawn-out conflict. A dedicated Association Law Group (ALG) exemplifies how a professional legal team helps resolve HOA disputes faster and more effectively.

First and foremost, a qualified [Condo Association attorney Miami](https://www.algpl.com/) offers a deep and nuanced understanding of condominium and HOA law under Florida statutes. ALG serves as general counsel to hundreds of HOAs and condominiums, guiding associations through day-to-day operational issues and ensuring compliance with statutes and governing documents.

Because ALG and similar attorneys routinely draft, review, and interpret declarations, bylaws, rules and regulations, they can spot ambiguities, inconsistencies, or legal deficiencies before they become disputes. Proactive legal review reduces the likelihood of misunderstandings between homeowners and associations a key factor in preventing conflicts from arising in the first place.

When disputes do occur such as disagreements over assessments, enforcement actions, common-area maintenance, or compliance issues ALG provides swift, informed counsel. Their team has combined decades of experience and has resolved thousands of matters, which empowers them to craft efficient dispute-resolution strategies tailored to each case.

One of the chief advantages of involving an experienced attorney early is expedited resolution. Rather than letting disagreements linger and escalate, the attorney can mediate between conflicting parties, clarify legal obligations, and guide the board on proper notice, documentation, and enforcement often avoiding court altogether.

If litigation becomes unavoidable for example, in cases of delinquent dues, lien enforcement, or covenant violations ALG already knows how to structure the case for efficiency. Their familiarity with court procedures, regulatory requirements, and HOA legal precedents allows them to proceed without unnecessary delays, reducing both time and legal costs.

Beyond just reacting to disputes, ALG helps associations adopt a governance framework that minimizes future conflicts. This involves updating governing documents, setting clear rules, standardizing enforcement procedures, and educating board members about their legal duties. By creating clarity and consistency, the likelihood of misunderstandings and thus disputes is greatly reduced over the long term.

Lastly, strong counsel also ensures that collection efforts for unpaid assessments or dues proceed smoothly and legally.

Team Lead Role to Architect - Step Back?,"At my current job for 9 years - grew from an engineer to team lead, of a team of 6. Recently company got acquired and in the last revisions pre-acquisition my team's expansion was limitied. 

As a result my title growth was blocked and my salary capped at a 2% increase. I had issues with management on this as I believed it was unfair. I am now certain that I want to leave.

Current salary: 85k + 15k bonus.

I hit the interviews and got two offers:

Role 1:
Head of Engineering at a 40 person consultancy company at a lower salary.

Pros:
- I will still be a people manager
- I will have full direction to do whatever I want given I can convince a very inexperienced CTO

Cons:
- Paycut (Salary is 80k)
- I won't be learning anything as it is clear I'm more experienced than the CTO both in terms of running teams and also technical expertise.

Role 2: Architect at a growing startup. 

Pros:
- Same salary (95k) only minor paycut 
- Founded and run by technical and smart people

Cons:
- I will not be managing people for at least the first year.

My current career trajectory was to continue growing into management - role 2 seems more attractive but it also means it's a step back on the management track. I DO enjoy technical work and it's not something I am scared of, but I'm worried this sort of trajectory will out me behind in my career.

"Audit-Ready IAS 19 Valuations: Meeting Compliance Standards Across UAE, KSA, and Pakistan","Getting your employee benefit valuations right matters more than you might think. One wrong calculation can stop your audit in its tracks. Your financial reports lose trust. Penalties show up fast.

Organizations operating in the UAE, KSA, and Pakistan face growing complexity in reporting employee obligations. The region’s economic expansion makes this more critical. UAE’s insurance market jumped 21.4% to reach AED 64.8 billion in 2024. Saudi Arabia’s non-oil economy grew 4.5%. Pakistan recorded USD 3 billion in remittances during August 2024 alone.

These numbers mean bigger workforces and more complicated benefit structures. Your valuation work needs to match that reality.

**Understanding IAS 19 and Its Financial Impact**

IAS 19 sets the rules for how companies report employee benefits under international accounting standards. This framework changes everything about recording post-employment benefits, pension plans, and severance obligations.

The standard requires you to calculate the present value of all benefit promises you’ve made to employees. Your balance sheet shows these as liabilities. Your profit and loss statement reflects service costs and interest charges. Getting this wrong affects both reports badly.

The International Accounting Standards Board created IAS 19 to bring consistency to global benefit reporting. It covers wages and leave, retirement gratuity, sabbatical programs, and termination packages. You must recognize expenses when your employees perform their services. That timing gap creates tricky calculations.

**Different Benefits Need Different Treatment**

Post-employment benefits create the hardest math problems. UAE employers put up to 20% toward social programs. KSA contributes roughly 22% for nationals and 2% for expatriate coverage.

Defined benefit plans promise specific payouts based on final salary and years worked. You carry all the investment risk. Annual valuations become mandatory. Contribution plans work differently because you make fixed payments and walk away. The employee takes on the uncertainty.

Severance payments kick in when you end someone’s employment involuntarily. You create obligations when you clearly commit to letting people go or offering voluntary exits.

**What Goes Into a Proper Valuation**

Several technical pieces combine to create complete financial reporting. The present value of what you owe forms the core number. Plan assets offset some of that liability. Net interest affects both your balance sheet and income statement.

Annual reports demand extensive disclosure. You need to show your assumptions, test how sensitive results are to changes, and explain risk exposures. Balance sheets include net liabilities or sometimes assets when plans hold excess funds. Asset ceiling rules limit what you can recognize.

Income statements separate current service costs from interest. Past service costs hit profit immediately. Curtailment gains or losses need their own line. Actuarial gains and losses go to other comprehensive income, skipping the P&L entirely.

Footnotes must detail your key assumptions. Discount rates, salary growth projections, and demographic patterns all require explanation. Sensitivity analysis shows what happens if you move assumptions by 1%. UAE compensation makes up 32.16% of total expenses. That percentage translates to substantial obligations.

**Getting the Calculations Right**

Actuarial assumptions drive everything. Small changes create big liability swings. Discount rates follow high-quality corporate bond yields. UAE averaged 8% in 2024. KSA tracks similar patterns. Pakistan adjusts for local inflation and currency factors.

**Become a member**

Salary growth rates project future benefit levels. UAE forecasts range from 3.5% to 4.0% for 2025. Saudi patterns align with GDP projections. Pakistan reflects higher inflation environments. Mortality, turnover, and retirement patterns complete the demographic picture. UAE’s 90% expatriate workforce creates unique modeling challenges.

Testing sensitivity quantifies assumption impact. A 1% discount rate shift typically moves liabilities 15–20%. Salary changes create opposite effects. Mortality improvements increase what you owe gradually.

The Projected Unit Credit method links benefits to service years systematically. Each year earns specific entitlements. Final salary plans project career-end pay levels. Present value calculations discount future payments to today’s date.

**Meeting Local Requirements**

Each market brings distinct compliance demands. Regulators watch closely. UAE’s ADGM and DIFC maintain strict oversight. KSA’s SOCPA follows international standards. Pakistan’s framework continues changing.

UAE compliance blends federal labor law with emirate rules. Gratuity equals 21 days’ wages per service year. ADGM entities follow IFRS directly. DIFC companies mirror UK practices where relevant. Mainland firms adapt IFRS for local needs.

Saudi Arabia mixes SOCPA standards with global practices. GOSI creates defined contribution elements. Foreign workers get different treatment. ESB calculations use half-month salary for the first five years, then full-month salary after that.

Pakistan requirements reflect local employment practices. Gratuity funds operate under specific trust structures. Tax implications affect both sides. Pakistan’s inflation fell from 29.18% in 2023 to an expected 5.13% in 2025. That volatility demands frequent updates.

**Building a Compliance Strategy**

Your approach needs structure. Start with comprehensive review of current practices against IAS 19 requirements. Gap analysis identifies specific problems. Implementation establishes proper actuarial processes. Qualified professionals must perform annual valuations. Documentation needs to exceed audit standards consistently.

Monitoring maintains ongoing compliance. Regular assumption reviews reflect changing conditions. Quality control prevents errors. Recent studies show 51% of UAE firms skip critical disclosures. Proper documentation fixes most audit issues.

**Technology Makes Valuations Faster and Better**

Modern software transforms IAS 19 work from manual processes to automated workflows. Cloud platforms enable real-time teamwork between actuaries, auditors, and management. Data checks happen automatically. Reports meet audit requirements consistently.

Optimized workflows eliminate delays and improve accuracy. Data management creates single sources of truth. Regular updates maintain current profiles. Quality assurance uses multiple validation layers. Peer review catches errors early. Independent checking confirms assumptions make sense.

**Why Audit-Ready Valuations Protect Your Business**

Proper valuations protect you from multiple risks. Financial statement credibility depends on calculation accuracy and complete disclosure. Regulatory compliance prevents penalties. Investor confidence stays strong through transparent reporting.

These valuations provide critical inputs for strategic decisions. HR policies affect long-term financial commitments. Finance planning requires accurate liability projections. Workforce planning considers benefit costs. Budget development includes service cost forecasts. Risk management identifies potential volatility sources.

The region’s economic conditions influence assumptions directly. UAE inflation stays moderate at 1.74%. KSA maintains 1.7% average annual inflation. Pakistan achieves dramatic improvement from 29.18% to 5.13% projected. Professional services help you work through this complexity.

I always feel hideous and have always wanted to be “hot” and desirable,"I’m a straight man in my late twenties, born and raised in the US, and I still live here. I grew up mostly in an all white area, though I myself am not white. All my life I’ve felt that I am hideous, some days I feel I’m average or maybe, if I’m really lucky and my hair frames my face just the right way, I feel maybe even a little above average. 

I have a recessed chin, a crappy(read nonexistent) jawline, and nonexistent cheekbones. I’m about 5’8 which is what it is, I used to be hung up about my height but I’ve outgrown that(pun intended), even if I didn’t grow at all. 

To compensate for not being conventionally attractive, I worked my butt off to do well in school, obtain a top tier education from one of the best schools in the country. I now have a pretty high paying job that is respected. I dress rather well I am told. I am in excellent shape, and run 5k and 10k races on occasion(my time is nothing to write home about but it’s fun and keeps me in shape). I was asked out/approached by women maybe 5-6 times in my life so far, a sadly low number. The number of times I’ve been approached/asked out confirms what I’ve long believed, that I am not physically “hot” or conventionally attractive. 

Even as a teen I thought I was hideous. I’d vent to my parents about it, but of course, all parents find their kids beautiful. Now as an independent and fairly well accomplished adult, I’ve developed a pretty good personality I think. I have many friends, men and women, who seem to enjoy my company because I’m invited out almost weekly. I’ve been told by friends, peers, coworkers that I’m hilarious. I’m well-travelled and have some neat hobbies, so I do have stuff to talk about that people find interesting. Despite all this, I still hate what I see in the mirror and I’m still deeply saddened that I could never be considered hot here in my country. I toyed with the idea of plastic surgery since my teens to fix my face. 

Recently, due to a setback in my career, I moved away from friends and family to a different part of the country(still mostly white, much to my chagrin) but the pay is great and being a new ugly face in town feels exciting I guess. My purpose is to reassess and improve my position. I realized now that I am away, have an even higher income, I can finally scratch that deep seated source of grief and insecurity in my mind: my desire to be “hot” and be desired. After consulting many plastic surgeons, I’ve finally decided on one, and scheduled my surgery. 

I’m not telling anyone about my procedure and what I’m having done. I know my parents will be actively against it and upset with me. Same with my brothers and sister. 

I’m spending tens of thousands of dollars however to hopefully achieve what I’ve always sought - to be “hot” and be desired for my physical beauty as well as my personality and achievements. I’m both slightly nervous and cautiously optimistic that this will be the end of my nightmare of being considered undesirable and undateable/unapproachable because of my appearance. I’m tired of being told “confidence is key to attracting women” - true to an extent but you still need to be conventionally attractive in order to attract women, especially ones that are my type. I’m successful and fit and hit the gym, so guess I can’t be hit with that one. I have a sense of humor, so find a better joke that than that that’ll draw romantic interest. A funny man with charisma who’s not attractive is just a fun friend. Is it such a bad thing to get plastic surgery? What frustrates me is that conventionally attractive people on Reddit will be like it’ll never be equal to natural beauty. That’s as rich as a rich person born into wealth telling those of us who worked our way to become wealthy that we’ll never be the same - snob mentality. Anyways, thank you for listening…errr reading I mean. I needed to get this frustration and my excitement and my anxiety off my chest.

I’m 22 with no liabilities and I’m putting together a long-term equity portfolio that balances steady compounding with some high-growth ideas. After refining the initial list to diversify and adhere to a smaller capital size (₹35,000), I’ve shortlisted these 9 stocks with the following allocations:

# My Refined Long-Term Portfolio (with final calculated weightages):

* **ICICI Bank** – **15.89%** (Strong Buy, Moderate Risk)
* **HDFC Bank** – **14.39%** (Strong Buy, Moderate Risk)
* **Tata Power** – **10.97%** (Buy, High Risk)
* **KPIT Technologies** – **10.87%** (Buy, High Risk)
* **Cochin Shipyard** – **9.32%** (Buy, High Risk)
* **TCS (Tata Consultancy Services)** – **9.32%** (Accumulate, Moderate Risk)
* **Reliance Industries (RIL)** – **8.76%** (Buy, Moderate Risk)
* **Cipla** – **8.68%** (Accumulate, Low Risk)
* **Pidilite Industries** – **8.41%** (Accumulate, Low Risk)

The idea is to anchor the portfolio with stable compounders like the **Banking majors (ICICI, HDFC)** and the **Defensives (Cipla, Pidilite)**. The remaining stocks—**Tata Power, KPIT Tech, Cochin Shipyard, TCS, and RIL**—give me necessary exposure to higher growth themes like **Green Energy, Defense, Embedded Tech/Semiconductors, and Core IT Services**. The higher weights in the Banking stocks were necessary to utilize the small capital fully, reinforcing the portfolio's stability.

Finally landed multiple offers after 1+ year of job hunting: here is how I succeeded,"Hey Reddit! Recent grad here. I graduated this May, started job searching the summer before senior year, and just now began receiving multiple offers. 

After a lot of trial and error, here are the tips that ended up helping me the most. Obviously this is just what worked for me, but hopefully it helps someone.

1. If something isn’t working, change your approach (even if it’s uncomfortable.)

My biggest mistake was over-prepping. I’d write pages of responses, memorize perfect STAR stories, and try to script everything. By striving for perfection, I was missing the chance to genuinely connect with the interviewer. This is why I failed so many interviews.

I started succeeding once I focused on being more authentic and confident. I know everyone says that, and it used to annoy me because I didn’t know how to do it without memorizing perfect stories. What finally helped was this:

Take time to genuinely reflect on your strengths and achievements.
Think about how you’ve helped others, compliments you’ve received, and feedback from coworkers/managers. Even talk to former colleagues if it helps you pinpoint your strengths. Once you believe in them, communicating them becomes much more natural. These strengths become your “talking points,” which are easier to use than memorized stories.

Being good at interviews really comes down to knowing yourself deeply - what you value, what you’re looking for in a career, your strengths, and how your past experiences align with your goals. When you know yourself, you can answer almost any question authentically and naturally, and that’s how real connections form.

Trust yourself. Prep matters, but once you do the reflection above, you won’t need to prep nearly as much. Know your resume and experiences well, but don’t spend days memorizing, this burns you out and makes you sound robotic (technical interviews are the exception). Trust that you can think on your feet.

2. Referrals are the easiest path in. Networking works.

Hate to admit it, but LinkedIn Premium was worth it for me. I sent out 50+ connection requests a week and ended up forming meaningful relationships that led to referrals and, eventually, offers. I probably landed 20+ interviews through LinkedIn Premium cold messages. 

Also, don’t be afraid to stay in touch with interviewers at companies where you were rejected. I was rejected from a consulting firm before graduating, but I kept in touch with one interviewer who liked me. He later referred me to a colleague at another firm - which I ended up getting an offer at. You truly never know who will lead you to what.

3. Coffee chats build confidence.

As someone with zero family connections, networking felt daunting at first. But it helped me tremendously - not just with referrals, but with becoming a better interviewer. I scheduled at least three coffee chats a week. My goal wasn’t only to get referrals, but to get comfortable speaking professionally with senior leaders and sharing my story without pressure. It also helped me view seniors more as peers/mentors. By the time interviews came around, I felt much more comfortable being myself.

4. A lot of the outcomes are out of your control.

You can be a great interviewer but still not get the offer because of things happening behind the scenes. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve gone into an interview and immediately sensed they’d already chosen a candidate (bored, disinterested from the start). I’ve been ghosted after recruiters aggressively pursued me.

All you can do is reflect on what you could’ve improved, work on it, and move on.

Job searching sucks and can feel demoralizing at times but these tips helped me tremendously!

TL;DR:

Stop over-prepping and focus on genuinely knowing your strengths. Be authentic, not scripted. Networking and referrals matter a lot. Coffee chats build confidence. Some hiring decisions are out of your control, improve what you can.

Not sure if i want GRS anymore😭😭😭,"So, for some context... I've been medically transitioning for 1.5 years. All in, full package. Including the GRS preparations.\
Now, the reasons I wanted GRS were mainly cause I wanted experience as a woman (and maybe affirming myself further idk?) but also because I've had this dysphoria for _years_ since I was 12.

Today I suddenly asked myself like ""Why do I even want / bother about this?"". And suddenly it hit me that I'm... Kind of okay with my old bits? I mean, occasionally it's even convenient, stand to pee... How crazy it is, isn't it?

Like, whenever I'm thinking of risks (the main stopper for me) but also the fact that I made peace with my p\*nis, and would, counter intuitively, probably feel weird a bit with vagina? Idk anymore.\
Like, I want a GRS, then I'd probably have a great sex, free from dysphoria but... I'm not sure anymore...

I have consulted 7 GRS surgeons though (as everyone does, absolutely normal thing to do🫠🫠🫠) to select the best I could in Europe, and I am currently in 2 waiting lists, so I have a little under 4 years to decide...

But idk, it feels strange. Coming from hyper dysphoric me (severe genital dysphoria) at 12 years old who had prayed to God for literal _months_ to give me a coochie and HATING my current bits more than anything... Down to where I am rn where I'm not sure if I want this anymore even though I can get it before my 30s...

Am I simply dissociating? Would it be better to just go through with it, if that will make me happier? I mean, I'm somewhat scared of growing old, with my current bits, for the fear of ""what if"" and also, because there's a part of me that DOES actually want it...\
Like, to my shame, I do get sometimes jealous of girls who post their post op pics here... But idk, I'm just so confused atm...

Can anyone relate to my experience? Am I secretly a nonbinary person and just been making this dysphoria up? I'm glad to hear ANY piece of advice you have to offer, thanks!😭😭😭 

**TL;DR** : Girl, deep in transition, had genital dysphoria as a kid for YEARS before _seemingly_ vanishing, or at least, diminishing to the point I'm now reconsidering getting GRS at all due to the risks and fear of regret.\
